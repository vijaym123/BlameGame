Jobs for Vets - Help for Our National Treasures
Members of the Civilian Conservation Corps plant trees in Northern
Minnesota during the 1930s. The Veterans Civilian Conservation Corps of
2013 will continue this proud, environmental tradition.
Dear Friend,
Last week I joined Democrats and Republicans in support of a bill to
establish a Veterans Conservation Corps to put unemployed vets in
transition back to work - rebuilding our national, state and tribal
forests, parks, coastal areas, wildlife refuges, and cemeteries - while
they seek permanent employment.
Simply put, our returning veterans need jobs, and our public lands and
waterways must be protected and restored. Patriotism, common sense, and
sound economics require us to do all we can to foster both.
This is a tried and true idea rooted in President Franklin Roosevelt's
Civilian Conservation Corps that employed some nine million young
people - including my father, Hank Nolan, a Navy Veteran - between 1933
and 1942 to help rebuild America following the last Great Depression.
The new Veterans Conservation Corps will help with transition and
employment for vets AND address the $11.4 billion maintenance backlog
at our national parks as they utilize their military skills in fields
such as construction, mapping, and environmental restoration.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to press House Leadership for a vote to
restore emergency unemployment assistance to more than 200,000 veterans
of all ages - and two million other Americans - who urgently need help
as our nation continues to recover from this worst recession since the
first Great Depression.
As always, I welcome your comments and suggestions on this or any
matter of concern to you. Please feel free to contact me through my
website, www.nolan.house.gov
Have a great week.
Sincerely,

Standing Up for Steelworkers Pensions
Speaking on the House Floor in favor of reinstating the Health Care Tax
Credit
When hardworking Americans retire, they should never need to worry
about cuts to the pensions and health care benefits they rightfully
earned with each day on the job. That's why you see me (above) standing
up on the House Floor to support reinstating the critically important
Health Care Tax Credit, a tax benefit pensioners could use to help pay
for health care premiums, and which expired in January.
With that expiration, retirees whose pension plans have been taken over
by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) - including former
employees of LTV or National Steel on Minnesota's Iron Range - have
seen their pensions slashed in half. What a terrible way to treat
workers who once formed the backbone of U.S. manufacturing, helped pull
America out of the Great Depression, and drove us to victory in World
War Two by mining tens of millions of tons of iron ore for defense. We
will continue to urge House Leadership to allow a vote to fix this
injustice. Take a moment to watch my speech above. (They tried to gavel
me down, but I kept going.)

To the Rescue: Duty-Free Help for Nations in Trouble
U.S. humanitarian organizations that import life-saving used fire and
rescue equipment from Canada should not face tariffs that impede their
mission to help nations facing terrible natural disasters. So last
week, I introduced the bipartisan Humanitarian Firefighter Relief Act
with my Minnesotan colleague Rep. Erik Paulsen (R), to allow qualified
nonprofits to import used but serviceable equipment from Canada duty
free for shipment to countries in urgent need.
The good folks at the International Fire Relief Mission (IFRM) in
Lindstrom, MN, brought this problem to my attention, pointing out that
these tariffs can break the bank, or at least delay or prevent entire
shipments of supplies to nations facing floods, fires, earthquakes, and
other situations without the proper equipment.
Since this used equipment has no market value, it poses no threat to
U.S. manufacturers or cost to U.S. taxpayers. U.S. Customs & Border
Protection personnel should be focusing on the truly important work
they do, without being required to needlessly impede the humanitarian
missions of well-meaning Americans.

Long Overdue Recognition for America's Coast Guard
The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter ALDER, a 225-foot multi-mission buoy
tender, leaves her homeport of Duluth last week on an ice breaking
mission in the Great Lakes.
I am truly honored to sponsor legislation recognizing the Coast Guard's
vital role in defending our nation and celebrating the opening of the
very first United States Coast Guard Museum, scheduled to break ground
later this year.
The Ninth District Coast Guard of Duluth - and U.S. Coast Guards across
the country - are charged with protecting our shores, harbors, and
ports by ensuring our waterways are safe for travel and clear for
shipping. I recently toured their Duluth facilities with Rear Admiral
Fred Midgette, getting a firsthand look at all the important work they
do - including the numerous ice cutter missions they've embarked upon
this long, cold winter to keep our channels clear (pictured above). I'm
delighted to see these brave and dedicated public servants receiving
well earned thanks and recognition from their grateful nation.

Nolan Amendment Advances Timber Research & New Jobs
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acted quickly to
implement one of my amendments to the Farm Bill, requiring their Forest
Products Laboratory to research and promote the benefits of wood as an
environmentally beneficial building material.
Last week, the USDA announced a new partnership to train architects,
engineers, and builders across the country about the benefits of
advanced wood building materials. Wood may be the oldest building
material, but it is now one of the most advanced, and wood-based
designs used in industrial projects - such as skyscrapers - as well as
in our homes, are often more energy efficient, reducing our heating and
cooling costs, as well as our overall carbon footprint.
Most importantly, wood and forest products support more than one
million jobs, many right here in Minnesota's Eighth Congressional
District. This partnership will open up new markets for these products,
and ensure our northern Minnesota forest and timber industries can
create and sustain good-paying jobs well into the future.

Coming Up in Minnesota No matter the problem you're having, whether
it's receiving your disability check, your Social Security benefits,
your veterans claim - or if you just want to stop by and chat - my
staff is here to help. And this week, we'll be holding Congress Comes
to You meetings in International Falls, Littlefork, Sandstone,
Hinckley, Pine City, Ely, and Babbit. Check my website for exact times
and locations: http://nolan.house.gov/congress-comes-to-you-schedule
. I hope you can make it - and if
not, you can always get in contact by writing me an email
.

Finally...
All in the Family
Anyone who comes all the way from Minnesota to my office in Washington
gets treated - time permitting - to one of my famous Capitol Tours,
where we visit the bust of Chief Buffalo, marvel at the vases in the
Rayburn Room, and take a peek inside the Speaker's lobby before heading
outdoors for a photo in front of the Dome. So it was such a treat to
have my family & some friends out here this week so I could give them
the same tour. Here we are gathered around my desk - and this is only
part of the gang! If you get the chance to come out to D.C., whether
it's to advocate for an issue you feel strongly about, or just on
vacation with your family, feel free to stop by my office. If my
schedule allows it, I'll be thrilled to show you around.

Sincerely,
Standing

Speaking
on
the

in

reinstating
the
Health

When
hardworking

they
should
never
need
to
worry
about
cuts
to
the
pensions
and
health

benefits
they
rightfully
earned
with

That's
why
you
see
me
(above)
standing
up
on
the
House
Floor
to
support
reinstating
the
critically
important
Health
Care
Tax
Credit , a
tax
benefit
pensioners
could
use
to
help
pay
for
health
care
premiums,
and
which
expired
in
January.
With
that
expiration,
retirees
whose

have
been
taken
over
by
the
Pension
Benefit
Guaranty
Corporation
(PBGC)
-
including
former
employees
of
LTV
or
National
Steel
on
Minnesota's
Iron
Range
-
have
seen
their
pensions
slashed
in
half.
What
a
terrible
way
to
treat
workers
who
once
formed
the
backbone
of
U.S.
manufacturing,
helped
pull
America
out
of
the
Great

and
drove
us
to
victory
in
World
War
Two
by
mining
tens
of
millions
of
tons
of iron
ore
for
defense.
We
will
continue
to

House

this

To
the
Rescue:
Duty-Free
Help
for
Nations
in
Trouble
U.S.
humanitarian
organizations
that
import
life-saving
used
fire
and
rescue
equipment
from
Canada
should
not
face
tariffs
that
impede
their
mission
to
help
nations
facing
terrible
natural
disasters.
So
last
week,
I
introduced
the
bipartisan Humanitarian
Firefighter
Relief
Act
with
my
Minnesotan
colleague
Rep.
Erik
Paulsen
(R),
to
allow
qualified
nonprofits
to
import
used
but
serviceable
equipment
from
Canada
duty
free
for
shipment
to
countries
in
urgent
need.
The
good
folks
at
the
International
Fire
Relief
Mission
(IFRM)
in
Lindstrom,
MN,
brought
this
problem
to
my
attention,
pointing
out
that
these
tariffs
can
break
the
bank,
or
at
least
delay
or
prevent
entire
shipments
of
supplies
to
nations
facing
floods,
fires,
earthquakes,
and
other
situations
without
the
proper
equipment.
Since
this
used
equipment
has
no
market
value,
it
poses
no
threat
to
U.S.
manufacturers
or
cost
to
U.S.
taxpayers.
U.S.
Customs
&amp;
Border
Protection
personnel
should
be
focusing
on
the
truly
important
work
they
do,
without
being
required
to
needlessly
impede
the
humanitarian
missions
of
well-meaning
Americans.
Long
Overdue
Recognition
for
America's
Coast

The
U.S.
Coast

Cutter
ALDER,
a
225-foot
multi-mission
buoy
tender,
leaves
her
homeport
of
Duluth
last
week
on
an
ice
breaking
mission
in
the
Great
Lakes.
I
am
truly
honored
to
sponsor
legislation
recognizing
the
Coast
Guard's
vital
role
in
defending
our
nation
and
celebrating
the opening
of
the
very
first
United
States
Coast
Guard
Museum ,
scheduled
to
break
ground
later
this
year.
The
Ninth
District
Coast
Guard
of
Duluth
-
and
U.S.
Coast
Guards
across
the
country
-
are
charged
with
protecting
our
shores,
harbors,
and
ports
by
ensuring
our
waterways
are
safe
for
travel
and
clear
for
shipping.
I
recently
toured
their
Duluth
facilities
with
Rear
Admiral
Fred
Midgette,
getting
a
firsthand
look
at
all
the
important
work
they
do
-
including
the
numerous
ice
cutter
missions
they've
embarked
upon
this
long,
cold
winter
to
keep
our
channels
clear
(pictured

I'm
delighted
to
see
these
brave
and
dedicated
public
servants
receiving
well
earned
thanks
and
recognition
from
their
grateful
nation.
