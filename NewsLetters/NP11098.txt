Time to Unleash American Industry
Dear friends,
The American economic engine has been shackled by government regulation and overreach and nowhere is this more apparent than in Wyoming.
Despite the can-do attitude of the people of Wyoming, the federal government still seeks to tie our hands.
A clear example of this is the closure of the Neil Simpson I plant outside of Gillette.
This is a coal fired-power unit that had ten years left on its useful life. It was fully depreciated so it was providing the lowest possible rate for electricity that you can get, allowing those consuming that electricity to save money that could be saved for college, invested for the future, or spent at the supermarket.
The premature closure of this power unit was primarily due to EPAs overregulation.
This week I joined several of my colleagues to unveil the JOBS act.
This would unleash American industry and small business job creators who are the backbone of our economy. The JOBS act is just what we need to free our workers and job creators to grow the American economy.

Please
share your thoughts and concerns with me
as I continue representing the people of Wyoming as we fight against federal overreach.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
