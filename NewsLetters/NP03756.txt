Friends,
With
the holiday season in full swing, the 113 th
Congress has now come
to an end. Before we look ahead to the new year, I wanted to
take a moment to discuss the flurry of activity for us at the end of
the Congress.
Three Yards and a Cloud of
Dust
Former Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes used to sum
up his offensive strategy in football with the phrase, Three yards a
cloud of dust. That plan meant that if you ran the ball and got three
yards every play, those three yards lead to first downs, which lead
to touchdowns, which lead to wins.
Well, I subscribe to that philosophy when I think about
a lot of the legislation that comes before me, because the
way I see it
three yards isnt a compromise or a failure, its
progress. So, while the spending bill that came up for a vote in Congress
last week wasnt perfect, it moved our country on the right path and
included some important provisions that I want to tell you
about:
It does
not fund President Obamas executive action on immigration. I strongly
disagree with President Obamas recent actions, but those unilateral
mandates wont even go into effect until March. Thats why this bill
funds the rest of the government through September, and the Department of
Homeland Security (which would implement these executive actions)
only until the end of February. So we will fight the President on
immigration in the next session when we have a new Republican
Senate.
It provides no new funding for ObamaCare. In fact, we cut the
Individual Payment Advisory Board, the group created by ObamaCare that could
come between you and your doctor, by $10
million.
We cut the IRS
Budget by $345 million, which is lowest level it has been since
2008.
We cut the EPA budget by $60 million, and weve reduced their
staffing levels down to 1989 levels. Overall, since 2010, weve cut the
EPAs budget by
$2.2 billion.
As you can see, we managed to achieve
strong conservative victories with a Democratic Senate and
President. You can read more about some of the provisions in this
legislation

Our Great
Lakes
Last week, the House of Representatives
approved my legislation formally authorizing the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative for five years. The five Great Lakes contain one fifth of the
worlds fresh water supply and GLRI is a group of programs to make sure
this environmental and economic treasure is protected. My bill
formally authorizes funding of GLRI at $300 million annually for fiscal
years 2015-2019 and does not add any debt to the federal
budget.
This is a huge victory for Northeast
Ohio, because it means that we wont have to fight for the
next five years to ensure there is enough money to preserve and protect
our Great Lakes. They continue to be one of our worlds greatest
treasures, and there's going to come a time when water is the new oil,
so we have to make investments to secure this important
resource.
