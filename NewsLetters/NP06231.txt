Ok, I promise I don&rsquo;t just sit in the office all day, but I CAN&rsquo;T STOP hitting refresh!!! Since Jan Schakowsky emailed this morning, we&rsquo;ve received an incredible 423 donations from Illinois and around the country.
THAT'S SENSATIONAL!!!
This surge of grassroots support couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time. Speaker Boehner just dumped
$1,850,000.00
on Chicagoland T.V. and our race remains a DEAD HEAT. David, we just checked, and it looks like you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to respond to Jan&rsquo;s email. Don&rsquo;t worry -- there&rsquo;s still time!
Just use one of these links to pitch in before midnight:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
No regrets, Tracy
