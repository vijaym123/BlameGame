Here&rsquo;s the hard truth: the Koch Brothers reportedly spent $290 million dollars in the 2014 election -- and it paid off. It&rsquo;s a crushing blow for American democracy. It&rsquo;s more clear than ever we need to put an end to unfair campaign finance laws that have allowed the ultra-rich to rig our elections.
