David --
Cheri&rsquo;s race against her Tea Party opponent is
too close to call.
But this race is about more than polling numbers and money in the bank.
It&rsquo;s a choice between a leader who looks out for the middle class first. And a politician who only looks out for himself --
and
his big money backers. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re opening up Cheri&rsquo;s Middle Class Action Fund with the launch of our new ad.
David, you can become a Founding Member and get an exclusive
SNEAK PEEK
at Cheri&rsquo;s new ad.
If you like it (we hope you do!), please chip in to help Cheri keep fighting to give Illinois&rsquo; middle class a fair shot.

Whether it&rsquo;s raising the minimum wage, protecting Medicare and Social Security, or creating good paying jobs here at home, Illinois&rsquo; middle class families can count on Cheri.
But she can&rsquo;t do it alone, David. So please, help Cheri keep fighting for Illinois&rsquo; middle class: http://action.cheribustos.com/Founding-Member
