The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of May 26 - 30, 2014
This week, I was proud to join the American people in honoring the
brave men and women in uniform who have selflessly sacrificed their
lives to defend our great nation.
I had the honor of participating in
several events across the 32nd Congressional District, including the
Spring Creek Memorial Day Parade, the University Meadows Memorial Day
event, and the 73rd Annual Restland Memorial Day Service.
It was a
privilege to meet with veterans from our community and to hear stories
about their service to our country.

Memorial Day event
Memorial Day is a special time to come together and honor our veterans
and active duty service members who protect our liberties and defend
our freedoms. It is important that we remember the sacrifices of these
brave men and women each and every day and show them our deepest
gratitude for their dedication to our country.

TX-32 Academy Appointments
Each year, I have the distinct opportunity to nominate students to our
nation's Service Academies. Students requesting a nomination are
evaluated on a variety of criteria including academic background,
physical ability, personal recommendations, and an evaluation and
ranking by the Academy Selection Board. I'm delighted to announce that
14 students in the 32nd Congressional District have accepted
appointments to the United States Service Academies as members of the
class of 2018.
Aaron Garrett of Dallas and Mach Mason of Garland have been
appointed to the United States Merchant Marine Academy.
AB Bustamante and David Portner of Dallas and Nicholas
Padgett of Richardson have been appointment to the United States Naval
Academy.
Alicia Reese and Traian Pop of Dallas, Katie Miller of Wylie,
and Sam Eckholm of Richardson have been appointed to the United States
Air Force Academy.
Cory Hazelbaker, Mason Conine, and Nicholas Grant of Dallas
and Eli Eichenberger of Richardson have been appointed to the United
States Military Academy (West Point).
Laurent Njiki of Wylie has been appointed to the Naval
Academy Preparatory School.
These young men and women set themselves apart from their peers through
their rigorous dedication to high academic performance, personal
fitness, and moral character. I am delighted to join their families,
teachers, and friends in giving them our unwavering support as they
commit to promoting America's security and freedom.
Residents of the 32nd Congressional District who are interested in
seeking a nomination to a Service Academy may contact Jennifer Lang in
my Dallas office at 972.392.0505.
Legislation Approved in the House this week
On Thursday, I voted in favor of H.R. 4660, the Commerce, Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015
. This
bill provides funding for vital law enforcement, national security, and
public safety efforts while promoting initiatives dedicated to economic
growth, innovation, and job creation.
H.R. 4660 prioritizes funding
for the most critical programs, but also eliminates waste and
duplication to reduce spending by nearly $400 million from FY 2014
levels.
On Friday, the House passed H.R. 4681, the Intelligence Authorization
Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015
, to
authorize the national security functions performed by the U.S.
Intelligence Community. The United States Intelligence Community serves
an increasingly important role in protecting the American people and
our national interests at home and abroad.
Unfortunately, our enemies
are committed to using every resource available at their disposal to
harm Americans and disrupt our economy. I supported the Intelligence
Authorization Act because I believe that it is imperative that we
provide the men and women in our intelligence community with the
resources and capabilities necessary to effectively assess potential
threats and respond accordingly.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress
