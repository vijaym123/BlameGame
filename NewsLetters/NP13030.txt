January 24, 2014
Dear Friend,
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I observed the National Day of Service
by hosting an Affordable Care Act education and volunteer training
session with more than 150 Memphians in attendance. I appreciate the
support of Pastor Kenneth T. Whalum, Jr. and Seedco in organizing and
getting the word out about the event.
Attendees learned how they can
help their neighbors sign up for health insurance under the Affordable
Care Act and how communities are already benefitting from law. Dr. King
said that "injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane"
of all the forms of inequality, and I was glad to have so many
Memphians join us to help improve their communities' access to health
care. Channel 3 covered our event and you can watch what they had to
say here
. For more information about how you can help others sign up for
health insurance please contact Willie Henry in my District Office at
(901) 544-4131 or Seedco at (901) 528-8341.
Tomorrow morning at 8am CT, I will be on "Up with Steve Kornacki" on
MSNBC.
I hope you'll tune in to watch.

Preventing and Reducing Racial Disparities in the Justice System
>From the biased use of 'stop and frisk' policies to the impact of
unfair mandatory minimum sentences on minority communities which I
wrote about in Tuesday's Commercial Appeal
, there is widespread evidence that racial disparities pervade our
criminal justice system. These disparities undermine confidence in the
system, threaten the cause of justice, and cannot continue in a society
that holds fairness and equality in high regard.
The 'fierce urgency of now' that Dr. King spoke of demands that we do
everything in our power to eliminate them today. That's why I
introduced the Justice Integrity Act and Byrne/JAG Program
Accountability Act
, which will alleviate disparities when found, introduce more
accountability into the process, and help restore the public's trust in
the criminal justice system. You can watch my interview with Channel 3
about my bills here
.
Taking Advantage of the Affordable Care Act
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A
recent New York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer." A primary
reason for the high mortality rate is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. If you are at
risk, please take a moment in the coming weeks to take advantage of
provisions of the Affordable Care Act and get screened for breast
cancer--it can help save your life.
Honoring Dr. King's Legacy
In addition to hosting the Affordable Care Act education and volunteer
training on Monday, I also spoke at the 23rd Annual Martin Luther King
Prayer Breakfast at LeMoyne-Owen College.
The breakfast was dedicated
to the LeMoyne-Owen College students who organized and participated in
sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement and to the sanitation workers
and other supporters who participated in the sanitation workers strike.
I also attended Mayor Wharton's Be the Dream Commemorative Celebration
at the Mason Temple where I paid tribute to the seven recipients of the
2014 Be the Dream Legacy Awards: Rev. Samuel Billy Kyles, Judge Russell
Sugarmon, Jocelyn Wurzburg, Father Don Mowery, Dr. James L. Netters,
Fred Davis, and Beverly Robertson, and presented them each with
Congressional Record Statements praising their individual achievements.
Monday afternoon, I addressed the Southern Christian Leadership
Coalition (SCLC) at Cane Creek Baptist Church. I spoke about the
importance of Dr. King's April 4, 1967 speech at Riverside Church in
which Dr. King talked about the "triple evils" of war, racism and
economic exploitation.
I also spoke in support of the Kellogg's
workers who have been locked out.
Kellogg's Lockout
With the lockout at the Memphis Kellogg plant entering its fourth
month, I continue working with my colleagues in Congress and with local
officials to help put an end to it. My office has been in contact with
union representatives for months and Ispoke about the situation on the
floor of the U.S. House of Representatives
.
I hope this lockout ends quickly and these 226 hardworking Memphians
can get back to work as soon as possible.
Reining in the NSA
Late last week, President Obama announced several changes to the
National Security Agency's (NSA) domestic spying programs. When these
programs were unveiled, it was clear that the NSA had overstepped the
bounds of what it should do, and the President changes mark his
recognition that we must address this problem. I am hopeful that his
changes to domestic surveillance programs will result in meaningful
reforms, but Congress must go further and enact all of the
recommendations made by the President's NSA Advisory Committee last
month so that these sorts of overreaches cannot happen again. I will
continue working with both Democrats and Republicans on proposals like
my FISA Court Accountability Act
to better protect the privacy and rights of all Americans, as
well as to restore the public's trust in its government.
Protecting Horses from Abuse
Last year, I joined with Congressman Ed Whitfield of Kentucky in
introducing the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act to prevent the
abusive practice of horse "soring." Horse trainers often go to great
lengths to avoid detection rather than comply with current federal law
and train horses using humane methods. Our legislation would help stop
these practices, and it wouldn't increase the deficit by a penny. It
protects the health and integrity of the Tennessee Walking, Racking,
and Spotted Saddle Horse industries, essentially saving jobs, and I was
glad to see a letter from Priscilla Presley this month urging all of my
colleagues in Congress to support our legislation and help us pass it.
You can read her letter here
.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not
had access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to
afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in
Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
. Open enrollment for coverage in 2014 will
continue until March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance
coverage, you may also be eligible to save money on your health care
premiums in the Marketplace
.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov
, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901) 528-8341. You
can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to find out if
TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage option for you.
If you are one of the millions of Americans who need health insurance,
you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
Talking to Memphis Students
For 21 years the C-SPAN bus has helped inform communities, schools, and
universities around the country about the educational and research
resources that C-SPAN offers. When the bus came to Memphis last week, I
was able to join students from Immaculate Conception High School &
Soulsville Charter School and enjoyed discussing with them how our
government works.
Protecting Consumers from Postal Delays
"Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night" stops USPS mail
carriers from delivering our mail, as their unofficial motto says. And
they usually do it within just a day or two. Our recent weather makes
us realize just how hard those jobs are, but the Postal Service faces
significant challenges to stave off delays and further price increases.
That's a problem, because citizens around the country including seniors
and those living at or near the poverty line rely on speedy delivery by
the Postal Service to pay their bills. They didn't cause the Postal
Service's problems, and they shouldn't be punished for them. I've
introduced the Postmark Payment Act of 2014 to help ensure that
companies use the date a payment was mailed instead of when it was
delivered (the same standard used by the IRS) when processing payments,
protect consumers from late fees stemming from delayed USPS service,
and help Americans save money.
Veterans Resource Center Opens at UofM
On Wednesday, I attended the grand opening of the Veterans Resource
Center (VRC) at the University of Memphis.
It provides veterans a new
space on campus where they can relax, study, use a computer, or attend
seminars and outreach events.
The VRC, located in the Panhellenic
Building, will be a tremendous asset.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol
Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
.
Due to the rules of
the House of Representatives, I am only able to mail calendars to
residents of Tennessee's Ninth District. Please feel free to share this
email with other citizens of the Ninth District who may be interested
in receiving one but who do not receive my eNewsletter.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
Wishing you a happy and safe weekend,
As always, I remain.

Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable

Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like

noted
that

city
for

women
with

Honoring
Dr.
King&#8217;s
Legacy
In
addition
to
hosting
the
Affordable
Care
Act
education
and
volunteer
training
on
Monday,
I
also
spoke
at
the
23rd
Annual
Martin
Luther
King
Prayer
Breakfast
at
LeMoyne-Owen
College.
The
breakfast
was
dedicated
to
the
LeMoyne-Owen
College
students
who
organized
and
participated
in
sit-ins
during
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
and
to
the
sanitation
workers
and
other
supporters
who
participated
in
the
sanitation
workers
strike.
I
also
attended
Mayor
Wharton&#8217;s
Be
the
Dream
Commemorative
Celebration
at
the
Mason
Temple
where
I
paid
tribute
to
the
seven
recipients
of
the
2014
Be
the
Dream
Legacy
Awards:
Rev.
Samuel
Billy
Kyles,
Judge
Russell
Sugarmon,
Jocelyn
Wurzburg,
Father
Don
Mowery,
Dr.
James
L.
Netters,
Fred
Davis,
and
Beverly
Robertson,
and
presented
them
each
with
Congressional
Record
Statements
praising
their
individual
achievements.
Monday
afternoon,
I
addressed
the
Southern
Christian
Leadership
Coalition
(SCLC)
at
Cane
Creek
Baptist
Church.
I
spoke
about
the
importance
of
Dr.
King&#8217;s
April
4,
1967
speech
at
Riverside
Church
in
which
Dr.
King
talked
about
the
&#8220;triple
evils&#8221;
of
war,
racism
and
economic
exploitation.
I
also
spoke
in
support
of
the
Kellogg&#8217;s
workers
who
have
been
locked
out.
Kellogg&#8217;s
Lockout
With
the
lockout
at
the
Memphis
Kellogg
plant
entering
its
fourth
month,
I
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
in
Congress
and
with
local
officials
to
help
put
an
end
to
it.
My
office
has
been
in
contact
with
union
representatives
for
months
and
I spoke
about
the
situation
on
the
floor
of
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives .
I
hope
this
lockout
ends
quickly
and
these
226
hardworking
Memphians
can
get
back
to
work
as
soon
as
possible.
Reining
in
the
NSA
Late
last
week,
President
Obama
announced
several
changes
to
the
National
Security
Agency&#8217;s
(NSA)
domestic
spying
programs.
When
these
programs
were
unveiled,
it
was
clear
that
the
NSA
had
overstepped
the
bounds
of
what
it
should
do,
and
the
President
changes
mark
his
recognition
that
we
must
address
this
problem.
I
am
hopeful
that
his
changes
to
domestic
surveillance
programs
will
result
in
meaningful
reforms,
but
Congress
must
go
further
and
enact
all
of
the
recommendations
made
by
the
President&#8217;s
NSA
Advisory
Committee
last
month
so
that
these
sorts
of
overreaches
cannot
happen
again.
I
will
continue
working
with
both
Democrats
and
Republicans
on
proposals
like
my
FISA
Court
Accountability
Act
to
better
protect
the
privacy
and
rights
of
all
Americans,
as
well
as
to
restore
the
public&#8217;s
trust
in
its
government.
Protecting
Horses
from
Abuse
Last
year,
I
joined
with
Congressman
Ed
Whitfield
of
Kentucky
in
introducing
the
Prevent
All
Soring
Tactics
(PAST)
Act
to
prevent
the
abusive
practice
of
horse
&#8220;soring.&#8221;
Horse
trainers
often
go
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
detection
rather
than
comply
with
current
federal
law
and
train
horses
using
humane
methods.
Our
legislation
would
help
stop
these
practices,
and
it
wouldn&#8217;t
increase
the
deficit
by
a
penny.
It
protects
the
health
and
integrity
of
the
Tennessee
Walking,
Racking,
and
Spotted
Saddle
Horse
industries,
essentially
saving
jobs,
and
I
was
glad
to
see
a
letter
from
Priscilla
Presley
this
month
urging
all
of
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
support
our
legislation
and
help
us
pass
it.

been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Open
enrollment
for
coverage
in
2014
will
continue
until
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health

premiums
in
the
Marketplace .
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace

Talking
to
Memphis
Students
For
21
years
the
C-SPAN
bus
has
helped
inform
communities,
schools,
and
universities
around
the
country
about
the
educational
and
research
resources
that
C-SPAN
offers.
When
the
bus
came
to
Memphis
last
week,
I
was
able
to
join
students
from
Immaculate
Conception
High
School
&amp;
Soulsville
Charter
School
and
enjoyed
discussing
with
them
how
our
government
works.
Protecting
Consumers
from
Postal
Delays
&#8220;Neither
snow
nor
rain
nor
heat
nor
gloom
of
night&#8221;
stops
USPS
mail
carriers
from
delivering
our
mail,
as
their
unofficial
motto
says.
And
they
usually
do
it
within
just
a
day
or
two.
Our
recent
weather
makes
us
realize
just
how
hard
those
jobs
are,
but
the
Postal
Service
faces
significant
challenges
to
stave
off
delays
and
further
price
increases.
That&#8217;s
a
problem,
because
citizens
around
the
country
including
seniors
and
those
living
at
or
near
the
poverty
line
rely
on
speedy
delivery
by
the
Postal
Service
to
pay
their
bills.
They
didn&#8217;t
cause
the
Postal
Service&#8217;s
problems,
and
they
shouldn&#8217;t
be
punished
for
them.
I&#8217;ve
introduced
the
Postmark
Payment
Act
of
2014
to
help
ensure
that
companies
use
the
date
a
payment
was
mailed
instead
of
when
it
was
delivered
(the
same
standard
used
by
the
IRS)
when
processing
payments,
protect
consumers
from
late
fees
stemming
from
delayed
USPS
service,
and
help
Americans
save
money.
Veterans
Resource
Center
Opens
at
UofM
On
Wednesday,
I
attended
the
grand
opening
of
the
Veterans
Resource
Center
(VRC)
at
the
University
of
Memphis.
It
provides
veterans
a
new
space
on
campus
where
they
can
relax,
study,
use
a
computer,
or
attend
seminars
and
outreach
events.
The
VRC,
located
in
the
Panhellenic
Building,
will
be
a
tremendous
asset.
United
States
Naval
Academy
Summer
Programs
Each
year,
the
United
States
Naval
Academy
invites
more
than
3,000
students
to
Annapolis,
Maryland,
to
participate
in
its
summer
programs.
The
Academy&#8217;s
summer
STEM
program,
which
is
now
accepting
applications
here ,
gives
rising
8th,
9th,
10th,
and
11th
graders
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
some
of
the
best
college
professors
in
the
country
and
work
in
world-class
lab
facilities.
The
Academy&#8217;s
Summer
Seminars
gives
rising
12th
graders
the
opportunity
to
find
out
if
they
have
what
it
takes
to
be
midshipmen
by
allowing
them
to
experience
the
rigorous
academics,
physical
challenges,
and
student
life
at
the
Naval
Academy.

the
Summer
Seminar

Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here.
