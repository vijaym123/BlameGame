House Votes to End Bulk Collection of
Phone Records
On May 22, the House of Representatives approved a bill [ H.R. 3361 ] to end the governments bulk collection of phone
metadata
replacing it with a new, transparent process in which the
government must get approval on a case-by-case basis from a special court
before asking phone companies for specific call records.
The
House approved the bill on a vote of 303 to 121.

provisions.
The House vote was in
response to reports that the National Security Agency (NSA) was
routinely accessing phone metadata of most calls made within the United
States.
The metadata includes the date, time and duration of calls
but does not include the content of the calls or personal
identification information.
The NSA uses this information to identify
terrorist activity, but many Americans are concerned that their privacy is
not adequately protected.
The bill now moves to the U.S. Senate
for consideration.
Rep. Levin Introduces Bill to Close Corporate Tax
Loophole
On May 20,
Rep. Levin introduced legislation [ H.R. 4679 ] to
tighten restrictions on so-called corporate tax inversions, limiting
the ability of American companies to avoid U.S. taxation by combining
with a smaller foreign business and moving their tax domicile
overseas.
There have been more than 40 corporate inversions in the last
decade, costing the U.S. tax base billions of dollars.
The New
Republic recently wrote a great
article
on this
corporate tax-avoidance strategy.
Corporate inversions are a growing problem, costing
the U.S. tax base billions of dollars and undermining vital domestic
investments, said Rep. Levin. This egregious practice requires
immediate action.
This legislation would stop American companies from
avoiding U.S. taxes simply by purchasing a smaller foreign
company.
Lawmakers Urge Social Security Administration to Pay Earned Benefits
to Eligible Same-Sex Couples
Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 3
of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which prevented the
federal government from recognizing legal same-sex marriages performed
under state law.
Now that Section 3 of DOMA has been ruled
unconstitutional, legally married same-sex couples are able to take
advantage of federal benefits such as tax breaks, pension rights, and social
security, but fewer than 1,500 people have applied for Social Security
benefits in the 11 months since Section 3 was struck down.
Unfortunately, same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize
same-sex marriages -- like Michigan -- are effectively being denied their
earned benefits.
On
May 22, Rep. Levin joined 127 other Members of Congress in writing a
letter
to the Social Security Administration
Acting Commissioner Carolyn Colvin to urge her to take all necessary
steps to ensure eligible same-sex couples receive their benefits,
regardless of where they reside.
