Journey to the Arctic Circle
On April 17th, I traveled to Iqaluit, Canada with Secretary Secretary
of State John Kerry and Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to attend the
2015 Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting
. During the
meeting, the United States formally assumed the two-year Chairmanship
of the Arctic Council, presenting our nation with the opportunity to
demonstrate greater leadership within the region.
Report from Maine
With efforts underway in Congress to reauthorize the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act (ESEA), I've been touring Maine schools
and listening to Maine teachers,
administrators, students, and parents. At Freeport Middle School, I saw
how teachers are using technology in the classroom to broaden their
students' horizons.
I helped Lincoln Academy formally open the Cable-Burns Center and new
Residence Hall
, two
outstanding examples of how something as simple as a building can
support learning, encourage collaboration, and engage the community
(Photo courtesy of Lincoln Academy).
Report from Washington
My Washington staff and I have moved offices. If you're ever in the
nation's capital, be sure to come on by Hart Senate Office Building 133
for a visit!
The Super Bowl champion New England Patriots came to the White House
this month, and I was lucky enough to be there to join the celebration.
It was fun to re-live one of the best Super Bowls ever played. Great
game, great team. Be sure to check out my Instagram
to see more of the photos I take from my
IPhone.
Policy Update
*
The Senate is currently considering the Iran Nuclear Review
Agreement Review Act of 2015
, of which I am
an original cosponsor. While I believe any deal must to be enforceable
and verifiable, I also believe Congress must to have oversight over any
final deal reached by the U.S. and our P5 + 1 partners. There's only
one thing worse than an Iran that is attempting to support terrorism
and destabilize regimes in the region - and that is an Iran armed with
nuclear weapons that is supporting terrorism and destabilizing the
region.
*
After a long stalemate surrounding a provision in the Justice
for Victims of Trafficking Act, the Senate passed this important bill
that aims to curb sex trafficking and support victims by a vote of
99-0. Soon after, the Senate confirmed Loretta Lynch as the next
Attorney General
.
*
The Budget Conference Committee, which is the group of senators
and representatives tasked with reconciling the Senate and House
Budgets, released its report this week. I am disappointed that this
report focused almost exclusively on cutting programs. As a member of
the committee, I've pushed for a more sensible approach
that removes sequestration and strikes an appropriate balance between
spending reductions and revenue increases. Charting a serious path
toward fiscal responsibility - the ultimate goal - will require strong
economic growth, smart spending reductions, and new revenues.
