David --
As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, my job description is (sorta) simple:
Elect Democrats -- ESPECIALLY in the toughest races out there.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing you today.
We've just conducted an August review of our top races and Brad Schneider has a real fight on his hands.
If we want to win, we have to make sure Brad has the resources he needs to fight back against an onslaught of right-wing cash.
August 31st marks Brad&rsquo;s critical August budget deadline. It may sound like just another deadline, but frankly, it could be the difference between Brad winning or losing. It&rsquo;s that close. So, if you&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to chip in for Brad, this is it. Can he count on your support? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Don&rsquo;t wait -- chip in now while you can still make a difference: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-for-Brad
