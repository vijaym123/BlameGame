Good afternoon,
Most Americans are focusing on December 25th, but for 1.3 million
Americans looking for work, they have only 25 days before their only
source of income is cut off.
Unless Congress acts to extend the federal Emergency
Unemployment Compensation program, 1.5 million Americans will immediately lose
their Unemployment Insurance (UI) as of December 28, and another 1.9
million will lose their benefits over the first half of next
year.
Eliminating this
lifeline for over 3 million jobless workers over the coming months will
deal a devastating blow to families who are already struggling to find
jobs.
The GOP
Majority has indicated that Friday, December 13th is the last working
day for Congress this month so I am leading an urgent effort to ensure
action to extend UI.
I
am asking for you to

Federal unemployment insurance
remains a critical support for Americans looking for work in an
economy that still has 1.5 million fewer jobs than when the recession
started six years ago.
Last year alone, unemployment compensation kept
1.7 million people out of poverty, including 446,000 children.
Now is certainly not the time to cut off vital federal assistance to
workers who continue to struggle to find new
employment.
To receive federal unemployment
insurance, an individual is required to actively seek work, and has ample
reason to do so given the average benefit amount is less than $300 a
week.
Cutting off unemployment benefits to millions of Americans
searching for a new job will hurt consumer demand and impede our
economic recovery.
In fact, the Economic Policy Institute estimates
that allowing the federal program to expire in December would cost our
economy 310,000 jobs.
Please Join the eCall to Extend
Unemployment Insurance , and help give a human face to this important
issue.
Thank you for your
help, and please be assured that I will do everything I can to support
legislation in Congress to create American jobs and support
unemployed workers while they look for new jobs.
Sincerely
Sander
Levin
