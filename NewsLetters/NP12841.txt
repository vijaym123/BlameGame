Day at the North American International Auto Show, Cobo Center in Detroit
The City of Detroit is the Motor City and hosts the greatest auto show in the world, the North American International Auto Show.
Today, Representative Miller visited the show at the Cobo Center and saw firsthand the fantastic new cars
on display that are the main reason our domestic auto industry has returned with such a vengeance.
Michigan has always been the world&#8217;s leader in the auto industry because we are the home of the most skilled, determined, innovative and dedicated workers in the country who design, engineer and produce the best cars and trucks on the
market.
