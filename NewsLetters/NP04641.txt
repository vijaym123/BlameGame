Forbes Calls For Renewed Push to Avert Defense Sequestration, Restore Military Readiness
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, announced today a renewed push to pass
H.R. 733
and remove the Department of Defense from sequestration cuts, following Tuesdays Republican takeover of the U.S. Senate:
Last nights historic election has provided Republicans with the best opportunity to come together and avert the devastating effects the Budget Controls Act is having on our national security since it was first passed in 2011, said Forbes. I believe what we do about defense spending and resolving our militarys readiness crisis in the months ahead will be the defining issue for Republican leadership in both chambers. We are living in a world where our own Secretary of Defense has said that American military dominance can no longer be taken for granted. This bill is a simple solution to ensure we return to the business of building national security budgets for the world we live in, not the arbitrary budget environment sequestration has set for the Pentagon. I will continue to fight to ensure our men and women in uniform have all the training and resources they need so that they never have to fight a fair fight.
