Click here to sign our petition to demand Congress curb the effects of
Citizens United
&gt;&gt;
Citizens United
is a threat to our democracy. In 2012, outside groups spent millions to sway elections around the country and that was just the beginning.
David, we can&rsquo;t let a select few dictate the outcome of our elections.
Please take a stand with us to demand Congress curb the effects of
Citizens United
immediately:
David --
Unlimited, secretive money in our elections is a threat to our democracy.
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s
Citizens United
decision has allowed mega-donors to spend as much cash as they want to influence elections around the country.
Already this cycle, numerous outside groups have spent more than a million dollars against Brad to sway the outcome of our race. And with the election just weeks away, there&rsquo;s plenty more where that came from. David, we won&rsquo;t let our democracy be controlled by a select few.
That&rsquo;s why Brad&rsquo;s joining his colleagues across the country to demand that Congress take action to stop the influence of big, secretive outside money in our elections. Will you join Brad in demanding Congress take action to curb the influence of
Citizens United ?
If we want to stop secret money in our politics, we need to send a strong message to Congress. Let&rsquo;s get 10,000 people standing up to demand Congress take immediate action. 10,000 STRONG:
