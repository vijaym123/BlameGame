Dear Friends,
This week marked the 51st annual National Small Business Week. I was very proud to be an original co-sponsor of a resolution in the House of Representatives to honor of the occasion.
Small businesses -- including those in Western Pennsylvania -- have im pressively produced 65 percent of net new jobs over the past 17 years and currently employ more than half of America's private sector workforce. Unfortunately, our nation's outdated tax code often works against small businesses and those they employ when it should be ensuring their ability to thrive. For example, tax compliance costs are currently 65 percent higher for small businesses than for big businesses. It's also true that our tax code's complexities force nearly 9 out of 10 small business owners to rely on an outside tax preparer every year. This is unacceptable.
As a business owner myself, I know full well how burdensome a complex, 70,000-page tax code can be when it comes to keeping a business afloat and creating new jobs. As a member of the House Ways & Means Committee, I am committed to achieving a fairer and simpler tax code with lower rates that will help small businesses grow, invest, expand, and put more Western Pennsylvanians back to work with family-sustaining pay.
You can follow our progress here:

Sincerely,
After nearly three years, the Washington Monument is finally back open! Contact our DC office at 202-225-5406 for more information about how to book a tour for your next trip to our nation's capital!
This week is also National Police Week.
May we always salute those who nobly protect and serve our state and local communities, and always honor those heroes who have lost their lives in the line of duty
WATCH HERE
The entire month of May is Military Appreciation Month.
It is an opportunity to thank the heroic men and women in uniform who defend our country and preserve our way of life as the beacon of liberty to the rest of the world. This month, and all year round, let us remember that America remains the land of the free only because of the brave.
