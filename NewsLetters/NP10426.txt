Friend -
Theres a difference between partisanship and sticking to your principles. Principles are something you are willing to stand up for, regardless of who is in leadership. Regardless of what is popular. Regardless of what your peers are doing.
That is why I am proud to be one of only 17 Members of Congress to vote against all bailouts and stimulus packages under both President Bush and President Obama.
Because principles dont care which party is in power. Principles are about doing the right thing, just because its the right thing to do.
Yours in service,
Randy
