PEARCE VOTES TO REQUIRE
THAT EPA SCIENCE AND DECISIONS BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC REVIEW AND
INPUT
This week, the House passed H.R.
1030, the Secret Science Reform Act with a bipartisan vote of 241-175, to
require the EPA to base all regulations on data that is already
public. U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce released the following statement after
voting in favor of H.R. 1030 and a related bill -- H.R. 1029, the EPA
Science Advisory Board Reform Act.
Over the last six
years, the EPA has cost jobs and increased electricity rates for New
Mexico families through their economically damaging proposals, said
Pearce. These costly proposals have been implemented based upon science
that the EPA refuses to publicize for peer review. Taxpayers who pay
for these reckless regulations deserve a say in the process. H.R. 1030
is a common sense piece of legislation that simply requires the EPA
to publicize their science before they finalize a rule.
Yesterday, the House also passed H.R. 1029 by a vote of
236-181. The bill makes changes to the EPAs Science Advisory Board (SAB) to
increase public participation, increase transparency for selecting
advisors, and to ensure that the Board remains focused on science -- not
politics. In voting for this measure, Congressman Pearce
commented:
We must ensure that EPA Science Advisory Board
that reviews these costly regulations is fair and balanced. The panel is
heavily populated by scientists who receive grant money from the
agency itself. H.R. 1029 will work to guarantee that these job-killing
regulations are no longer subject to a biased panel and that there is
transparency in the review process. I ask that the Senate take up these
critical bills and that the President fulfill his promise to the
American people to foster transparency by supporting
them.
PEARCE CONGRATULATES PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU ON HIS
REELECTION
This week, Israelis re-elected Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as voters turned out in the highest
numbers since 1999 to support the Likud Party.
I am
eager to once again work with a proven leader of the Israeli nation and
our strong ally in the face of constant unrest in the Middle East. I
congratulate the Prime Minister and look forward to continuing our
efforts with him to strengthen our ties with Israel and reaffirm our
commitment to their security.
Israel is our fa mily, our loyal ally
in the face of conflict. We stand with
Israel.
