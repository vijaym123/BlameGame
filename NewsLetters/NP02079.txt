Dear Friend, This past week, the House Budget Committee introduced its full budget for fiscal year 2016.
The budget plan is officially known as the " Balanced Budget for A Stronger America ."
You can read all about it here .
I am currently reading through the pages of the entire plan
and analyzing the details with my staff, section by section, in order to fully comprehend what the budget will mean for our national debt, our economy, and our national security.
As of right now,
I am very glad to see that the plan will balance the federal budget in less than 10 years without raising any taxes -- which is in major contrast to
President Obama's reckless proposal , which includes $2.1 trillion in new taxes, deepens our debt, and never balances, ever.
I am also pleased that this plan would
repeal Obamacare in full -- including all of its expensive taxes, regulations, and mandates .
As I continue to look through the budget and have serious conversations about it with Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, I want to hear from
you
in particular about what you think of the plan and how it matches up with your priorities. Again, the official budget blueprint can be found
here .
Sincerely,
Rep.
Kelly Named Co-Chairman of
House Small Brewers Caucus
Bipartisan group re-established for 114th Congress,
focused on helping American small businesses grow
On Tuesday,
Rep. Kelly joined Reps. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Patrick McHenry (R-NC), and Richard Neal (D-MA) in announcing that the House Small Brewers Caucus has been reestablished in the 114th Congress. Founded by Reps. DeFazio and Greg Walden (R-OR) in 2007, this bipartisan group is dedicated to issues affecting America's small brewers and currently includes 143 members of the House of Representatives.
Statement by Rep. Kelly, Co-Chairman:
"I am very excited to begin work with the Small Brewers Caucus and honored to serve as a co-chairman. These main street businesses contribute powerfully to their local economies and provide many thousands of jobs to hardworking Americans from coast to coast. In Pennsylvania alone, craft breweries add to the commonwealth's economy by nearly $2 billion. I look forward to making sure national policy allows them to keep brewing, growing, and creating more American jobs."
Statement by Rep. DeFazio, Co-Chairman:
"If you need an example of how craft breweries affect local economies, just look at Oregon. Even during the recession, craft breweries experienced strong growth and today, it's a $3 billion industry in my state. These small businesses support thousands of local jobs and provide the rest of us with a quality American product. This is exactly the kind of growth I'm proud to support."
Statement by Rep. McHenry, Vice Chairman:
"With over 20 small breweries in the 10th District I know the positive, job-creating impact these small businesses can have. I look forward to continuing as Vice Chairman of the Caucus as we work in a bipartisan fashion to advance their interests."
Statement by Rep. Neal, Vice Chairman:
"The craft brewing industry in Massachusetts is thriving because they make distinctive products for passionate consumers. These breweries are locally owned, generate economic development and create good jobs. I have been an enthusiastic supporter of these small businesses and entrepreneurs and I am proud to be a part of the leadership of this bipartisan caucus."
Statement by Bob Pease, President and CEO,
Brewers Association :
"The Brewers Association would like to congratulate Rep. DeFazio (D-OR), Rep. Kelly (R-PA), Rep. Neal (D-MA) and Rep. McHenry (R-NC), Co-Chairs and Vice Chairs, respectively, of the House Small Brewers Caucus. They and the other 143 members of Congress who make up the Caucus recognize the economic impact that craft breweries have had over the past 25 years and continue to have in their communities across the country. More than 3,400 craft breweries are responsible for employing more than 115,000 Americans in quality manufacturing and service jobs. We thank the Chairs and Vice Chairs for their efforts, which help foster the continued growth of-and job creation by-craft breweries across the country."
NOTE:
Craft brewing is a fast-growing, $34 billion+ industry that directly supports 115,000 American jobs. In order to create a better business environment for small brewers, the Caucus is backing legislation that would reduce the excise taxes on the sale of the first two million barrels of beer sold by small brewers each year. For example, the Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce (BREW) Act would allow small brewers to use the savings to purchase more equipment and hire more workers, boosting local economies in communities across the nation.
