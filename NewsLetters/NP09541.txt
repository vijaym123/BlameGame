Dear
Constituents,
Members of Congress are public servants entrusted with many duties,
including the responsible use of taxpayer funds.
As public
servants, Members of Congress should not receive special privileges at the
expense of hard working taxpayers. It is unconscionable that while
constituents in my district continue to struggle to make ends meet,
Members of Congress have used taxpayer money to purchase luxury airfare
that even our men and women in uniform are restricted from
buying.
That is why I joined with my colleagues from both sides of the
aisle to introduce the
"If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then
so Should Congress Act."
This simple, fiscally responsible
bill would close the loophole that allows Members of Congress to buy
first-class airfare at taxpayer expense. Click
here
to learn more about
the bill.
If our men and women in the
military are restricted from buying first-class airfare, the same should
apply to
Congress.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz, M.D.
Representing
California's 36th Congressional District
