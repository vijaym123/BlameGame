Dear Friend &ndash;
Fall seems like it goes in warp speed&hellip;the first day of school, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and then all of a sudden it&rsquo;s time to stuff those stockings!
I&rsquo;m emailing you today to tell you take a step back and breathe. Feel better? Good, because now I&rsquo;m going to ask you to add one more thing to your &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list this Fall: sign up for health insurance.
Yup, it&rsquo;s that time of year again. Open enrollment for 2015 health insurance plans through
Covered California
begins next Saturday, November 15, 2014, and ends February 15, 2015.
If you or someone you know doesn&rsquo;t have health care coverage right now, this is your opportunity to get the security and peace of mind that comes from being insured, whether it is through Covered California or Medi-Cal.
I want to make sure you are able to enroll in the best health insurance plan for you and your family, so
I&rsquo;m continuing my &ldquo;Enroll OC&rdquo; initiative to connect Orange County residents with certified, in person bilingual health insurance enrollment services.
Please join me next Saturday, November 15, 2014, from 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the Plaza Santa Ana on the northwest corner of 4th &amp; French St in Downtown Santa Ana to kick off Covered California open enrollment season with fun, information and enrollment services.
Hope to see you there,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
