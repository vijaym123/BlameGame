Statement on Creation of Benghazi Select
Committee
5/10/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn has
released the following statement following his vote supporting the
creation of a Select Committee to investigate the tragedy at
Benghazi.
"I have long supported the
creation of a Select Committee on Benghazi and I was pleased to vote to
create one this evening. It is outrageous that the Administration has
been deliberately withholding documents that were subpoenaed by the
House and has not taken this investigation or the death of four
Americans seriously. Recent documents show an egregious cover-up of the
Benghazi attacks going all the way to top officials at the White House. I
hope that this select committee will bring necessary closure to those
impacted by these Islamist extremists and finally provide answers to
the American people."
