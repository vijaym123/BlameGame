Safe travels back to Arkansas.
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.Res. 628 , which included a motion to go to
conference on the Senate amendments to H.R. 3230, the Veterans Access to
Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014.
The
House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3230
combines the texts of H.R. 4810
and H.R. 4031, both previously passed by the House.
H.R. 4810
requires the secretary to provide non-VA care to veterans who have
faced extensive wait times or live more than forty miles from a VA
medical facility.
This authority terminates after two years.
The bill also requires the secretary to contract with private sector
experts to conduct an assessment of the hospital care and medical
services provided by the VA and eliminates bonuses and performance awards
for all VA employees for fiscal years 2014-2016.
H.R. 4031
generally gives the secretary authority to remove an employee of the
Senior Executive Service if the secretary determines that the employees
performance warrants removal.
After the passage of H.Res.
628, the House began consideration of
H.R. 4870 , the
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015, which provides the
Department of Defense (DoD) $491 billion in discretionary spending and $79.4
billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) for fiscal year
2015.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committees Defense
Subcommittee, I had the opportunity to speak in support of
H.R.
4870 on the House floor.
You can
watch my speech here .
In
addition to continuing consideration of the defense appropriations bill,
on Thursday, Representative Jim Matheson (UT-4), Representative Adam
Kinzinger (IL-16), and I introduced the ENERGY STAR Regulatory
Improvement Act ( H.R.
4921 ).
The bill addresses the ENERGY
STAR programs third-party certification requirement and its impact on
the consumer electronics industry by allowing electronics
manufacturers to earn their way out of the EPAs burdensome requirement with a
demonstrated track record of compliance.
On March 7, 2011, the Department of Energy (DOE)
published a final rule that imposed blanket third-party certification
requirements for all products applying for participation in the
Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) ENERGY STAR program.
Unfortunately, the rule disregarded successful and existing industry programs and
has increased the regulatory burden on manufacturers, as well as the
cost of testing for manufacturers and the federal
government.
This onerous and
unnecessary EPA requirement is doing a disservice to the ENERGY STAR
brand, which American taxpayers and businesses have spent a good deal of
money to build. Rather than force companies to consider putting their
products on the market without receiving ENERGY STAR certification, even
though most would likely qualify, we should ease the process to allow
companies to get their products certified and quickly on shelves for
consumers trying to stay on the cutting edge of
technology.
Today, the House
completed its work on H.R. 4870, and Im pleased it passed the bill with
strong bipartisan support.
Our national debt and constrained
resources have made our annual appropriations process much more difficult;
they have also made it much more important.
We owe it to our
troops to get our business done on this bill to ensure they have the
funding necessary to keep them safe, well-equipped, and ready for
anything.
I hope the Senate will promptly take up this essential
legislation.
Next week, the House will consider the Customer
Protection and End-User Relief Act (H.R. 4413), the Domestic Prosperity and
Global Freedom Act (H.R. 6), the North American Energy Infrastructure
Act (H.R. 3301), and the Lowering Gas Prices to Fuel an America That
Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899).
