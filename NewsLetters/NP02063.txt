WEEK IN
REVIEW
Last week, I had the opportunity to travel to Egypt, Cyprus, England,
and Ukraine with seven of my fellow members of the House
Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. Find out more about our trip by reading
this article from the
Democrat-Gazette !
This week was a busy one in Washington! I would like that

during their visits to our nations capital, including the Arkansas
Public Housing and Community Development, Katy Allison from the Arkansas
Department of Health,
Brandon Hartung and Johnathan Chavez of
Fayetteville, the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management, Lance
McAvoy of Fort Smith, Arkansas Special Olympian Chelsea Durham from
Farmington, the Arkansas Hospital Association, NWA Council President Mike
Malone, the Arkansas Association of Student Assistance Programs, Delta
Regional Authority Chairman Chris Masingill, the Arkansas Postmasters,
Arkansas Waterways Commissioner Gene Higginbotham, the Arkansas Small
Business and Tech Development Centers, Dr. Dan Fields of Fayetteville,

to Arkansas!
On Tuesday morning, the House Budget Committee introduced
its fiscal year (FY) 2016 budget proposal, A Balanced Budget for a
Stronger America ( more info
here ) . This House Budget recognizes and takes the
important and necessary steps to get America back on track and ensure that
we are spending responsibly, purposefully, and within our means, just
like families across the Third District of Arkansas and all over the
country have to do. America cannot afford to continue down this
unsustainable path; we are more than $18 trillion in debt. Even more
concerning is that 66 percent of our spending is going out the door
automatically
without any oversight
to finance mandatory programs and the
interest on our debt. We cannot solve our financial crisis by cutting
discretionary spending alone. I applaud its
introduction.
Tuesday afternoon, the House passed the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform
Act of 2015 ( H.R.
1029 ) by a vote of 236-181 ( Roll Call #121 ). H.R.
1029 amends federal law relating to the Scientific Advisory Board to
establish qualifications for members, reinforce independence of the board,
facilitate public participation in the boards advisory activities, and
limit the advice given by the board to scientific determinations,
rather than policy direction.
Did you
know Arkansas has over 49,000 farms, which contribute $16 billion to our
state's economy? On Wednesday, we celebrated National Agriculture Day!

Wednesday afternoon, the
House passed the Secret Science Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1030 )
by a
vote of 241-175 ( Roll
Call #125 ) . H.R. 1030 prohibits the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating
any risk, exposure, or hazard assessment, criteria document, standard,
limitation, regulation, regulatory impact analysis, or guidance unless
all scientific and technical information relied on to support the
regulation or guidance is specifically identified and publicly
available.
On Thursday,
the House passed a resolution providing for congressional
disapproval of the rule submitted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
relating to representation case procedures ( S.J.Res. 8 ) by a vote of 232-186
( Roll Call
#128 ). S.J.Res. 8 disapproves and nullifies the
NLRB rule published on December 15,
2014 , that dramatically alters long-standing policies
governing union elections. The rule (known as the ambush elections
rule) is set to be finalized on April 14, 2015, and would drastically
cut the time between the filing of a certification petition and the
conduct of an NLRB secret ballot election. Under the rule, workers could
have as little as 11 days to consider all of the facts about joining a
union before casting ballots, and the rule restricts the rights of
employers and employees to communicate during a union organizing
campaign by eliminating pre-election evidentiary hearings and requests for
review. The rule delays decisions on important questions related to
voter eligibility and requires employers to provide their employees
personal information to union leaders conducting an organizing
campaign.
Today, Im back in Arkansas and had the privilege of joining Rod Bigelow
and Alice Walton to welcome Dr. Jane Chu, the Chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts, to Crystal Bridges. And tomorrow night, Im
looking forward to cheering on the Arkansas Razorback basketball team
as they take on the Carolina Tar Heels.
Woo
Pig Sooie!
Next week, in addition to suspensions, the House
will consider the FY2016 Budget Resolution and legislation to repeal
and replace the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate
(SGR).
Best wishes
for a restful weekend and GO HOGS!
