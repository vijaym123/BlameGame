Working to Protect Our Environment
Dear Friend,
Last week, our nation commemorated Earth Day and Arbor Day, giving us
an opportunity to renew our commitment to the environment we all share.
It is also a chance for us to redouble our efforts to tackle the
harmful effects of climate change, protect our air and water, and
invest in clean and efficient energy.
As a member of the Livable Communities Task Force in Congress, I have
fought to protect our nation's clean air and water laws, and to make
our communities in Southeastern Pennsylvania more livable. I have
consistently opposed measures that would restrict the Environmental
Protection Agency's authority to protect our nation's air and have
supported efforts to improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and
trucks. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I helped write
comprehensive energy legislation that would have repealed billions in
subsidies for the oil industry and redirected those revenues into the
development of renewable energy and energy conservation technologies.
As a mother and grandmother, I believe that we must protect our
environment for future generations by preserving Pennsylvania's
pristine lands and other natural treasures. Our spectacular forests,
rivers and mountain areas, and our 120 state parks and 18 national
parks showcase America's cultural heritage and natural beauty. These
natural wonders attract visitors from around the world and serve as
important economic engines for Pennsylvania's communities.
As always, it is a privilege to represent you in Congress. Please visit
my website
and Facebook page
to learn more about my efforts to improve
our quality of life and strengthen our economy.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Working

Protect
Our

Dear
Friend,
Last
week,
our
nation
commemorated
Earth
Day
and
Arbor
Day,
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
renew
our
commitment
to
the
environment
we
all
share.
It
is
also
a
chance
for
us
to
redouble
our
efforts
to
tackle
the
harmful
effects
of
climate
change,
protect
our
air
and
water,
and
invest
in
clean
and
efficient
energy.
As
a
member
of
the
Livable
Communities
Task
Force
in
Congress,
I
have
fought
to
protect
our
nation&#8217;s
clean
air
and
water
laws,
and
to
make
our
communities
in
Southeastern
Pennsylvania
more
livable.
I
have
consistently
opposed
measures
that
would
restrict
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency&#8217;s
authority
to
protect
our
nation&#8217;s
air
and
have
supported
efforts
to
improve
the
fuel
efficiency
of
our
cars
and
trucks.
As
a
member
of
the
Ways
and
Means
Committee,
I
helped
write
comprehensive
energy
legislation
that
would
have
repealed
billions
in

for
the
oil

and

that
we
must
protect
our

for
future

by
preserving
Pennsylvania&#8217;s

Our

and
our

showcase
America&#8217;s

These
