David -- we need your help now more than ever.
1. Cheri was just named the MOST vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
2. Boehner&rsquo;s 2016 campaign machine is ALREADY going after us.
3. Our mid-month fundraising deadline is TONIGHT.
David Johnson CHIPPED IN TO CHERI'S REELECTION?
NOT YET!
No matter what, Cheri is going to stay focused on the issues -- she&rsquo;ll never stop fighting to create jobs and defend Medicare and Social Security.
But with a target on our backs, we need to starting laying the groundwork for our reelection campaign right away. We need to be able to fight back for Cheri. Will you donate $5 or more before tonight&rsquo;s midnight deadline?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$35 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
Thanks for your unwavering support.
