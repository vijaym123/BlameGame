Dear Friend,
Hiking with Secretary Jewell
Earlier this month I joined Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell for
a hike on the Point Arena-Stornetta Public lands on the Mendocino Coast
. It isn't often that a Cabinet
Secretary visits, and it's rarer still that one comes to discuss
expanding a National Monument in our backyard.
I'm thrilled that she accepted my invitation and held a public meeting
where she saw and heard the tremendous support from the local community
for adding these breathtaking lands
to the
California Coastal National Monument (CCNM).
This is an unmatched opportunity to preserve more than 1,600 acres of
pristine coastal lands. A National Monument designation adds another
level of protection to this complex and fragile ecosystem, which
includes habitat for several endangered species, coho salmon,
steelhead, Great Blue Herons, Peregrine Falcons and the Laysan
Albatross.
Safeguarding this national treasure isn't just good for the
environment; it would also boost the local economy. This would be the
first land-based addition to the California Coastal National Monument,
providing a gateway for visitors to experience the Monument, as well as
attracting customers to local businesses.
The potential benefit to the local economy is just one of the reasons
why the effort to protect this amazing stretch of the Mendocino coast
has such broad support-from State and local elected officials to the
Manchester-Point Arena Band of Pomo Indians, conservation groups across
the country, and local businesses and civic leaders.
Public Meeting in Point Arena
We were very fortunate that the House of Representatives unanimously
passed
my very first bill as a Congressman
, which would add this magnificent land to the National
Monument. I'm very pleased that our two California Senators, Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, support this effort in the Senate.
As we continue to move this legislation forward, I'm gratified by
Secretary Jewell's commitment: at the public meeting in Point Arena she
told us that if Congress doesn't get this done, the Administration
will. This community meeting was a critical step needed before
President Obama can use the authority under the Antiquities Act to do
just that.
I'll keep you updated on our efforts to preserve this spectacular land,
but for now, things are looking good! Thank you for all your support.
Sincerely,
Jared Huffman
P.S.: Even the whales were conspiring to impress Secretary Jewell and
she was able to see them breaching just offshore!

Dear
Friend,
Hiking
with
Secretary
Jewell Earlier
this
month
I
joined
Secretary
of
the
Interior
Sally
Jewell
for
a
hike
on
the
Point
Arena-Stornetta
Public
lands
on
the
Mendocino
Coast .
It
isn&#8217;t
often
that
a
Cabinet
Secretary
visits,
and
it&#8217;s
rarer
still
that
one
comes
to
discuss
expanding
a
National
Monument
in
our
backyard.
I&#8217;m
thrilled
that
she
accepted
my
invitation
and
held
a
public
meeting
where
she
saw
and
heard
the
tremendous
support
from
the
local
community
for
adding
these
breathtaking
lands
to
the
California
Coastal
National
Monument
(CCNM).
This
is
an
unmatched
opportunity
to
preserve
more
than
1,600
acres
of
pristine
coastal
lands.
A
National
Monument
designation
adds
another
level
of
protection
to
this
complex
and
fragile
ecosystem,
which
includes
habitat
for
several
endangered
species,
coho
salmon,
steelhead,
Great
Blue
Herons,
Peregrine
Falcons
and
the
Laysan
Albatross.
Safeguarding
this
national
treasure
isn't
just
good
for
the
environment;
it
would
also
boost
the
local
economy.
This
would
be
the
first
land-based
addition
to
the
California
Coastal
National
Monument,
providing
a
gateway
for
visitors
to
experience
the
Monument,
as
well
as
attracting
customers
to
local
businesses.
The
potential
benefit
to
the
local
economy
is
just
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
effort
to
protect
this
amazing
stretch
of
the
Mendocino

has
such
broad
support&#8212;from
State
and

to
the

the
country,
and
local

and
civic
leaders.
Public
Meeting
in
Point
Arena We
were
very
fortunate
that
the
House
of

unanimously
passed
my
very
first

as
a

I&#8217;m
very

and
Dianne
Feinstein,
support
this
effort
in
the
Senate.
As
we
continue
to move
this
legislation
forward,
I'm
gratified
by
Secretary
Jewell's
commitment:
at
the
public
meeting
in
Point
Arena
she
told
us that
if
Congress
doesn't
get
this
done,
the
Administration
will.
This
community
meeting
was
a
critical
step
needed
before
President
Obama
can
use
the
authority
under
the
Antiquities

to
do
just
that.
I&#8217;ll

for
now,
things
are
looking
good!
Thank
you
