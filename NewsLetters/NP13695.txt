Dear Friends,
Yesterday I voted to strengthen our national security and provide
stability for our nation, our families, and small businesses. This
budget will give our men and women in uniform relief from the
devastating effects of long-term budget uncertainty, which has weakened
America's ability to be a global leader. Although this deal is far from
perfect because it fails to address ballooning entitlement programs,
the true drivers of our debt, it will reduce our deficit by $23 billion
. It will also
provide much needed relief from the sequester by replacing broad,
damaging cuts with targeted cost savings.
Without this budget,
Congress would fail to carry out the government's Constitutional duty
of providing for a common defense and risk another government shutdown.
On Tuesday I had the opportunity to question Secretary of State John
Kerry
about the proposed Iran nuclear deal during the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing. I expressed my concerns that this
deal could lead to a nuclear arms race in an already unstable region
and urged the Secretary to explore other options. I was disappointed to
learn later in the day that the Senate will not be pursuing further
economic sanctions and believe this will hurt America's negotiating
leverage during the talks. In response to the Senate's announcement, I
introduced bipartisan legislation
this
week that seeks to verifiably prevent a nuclear Iran, and also calls
for new sanctions.
In addition, the House passed the National Defense Authorization bill.
This bill, which I supported, maintains salary levels for our military,
combats sexual assault, maintains our naval fleet, and authorizes
additional funding for Guard and Reserve equipment.
The bill also
prohibits the transfer of GITMO detainees to the U.S., places
restrictions on funding to Pakistan, requires reports from Department
of Defense on Benghazi, and recognizes the continued threat posed by
Iran.
This week the House passed H.R. 2019, the
Gabriella Miller Kids First
Research Act
which will redirect
millions away from taxpayer-funded political conventions and instead
spend that money on pediatric research at the National Institutes of
Health.
As a co-chair of the
Childhood Cancer Caucus
, I was pleased to see this important
legislation pass with bipartisan support.
This bill will have a real
world impact on the lives and futures of those affected by pediatric
cancer.
As Congress recesses for the year, my family and I want to wish you all
a very Merry Christmas and a joyous New Year.

the
