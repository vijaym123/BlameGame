Dear
Friends,
On Monday, I will be at the Idaho State Veterans
Cemetery to help honor the brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice
to our great country.
Ive attended the Memorial Day
ceremony each year since I took office in 2011. I consider it a solemn
privilege to speak on behalf of everyone in the 1 st
Congressional
District.
Words, of course, fail at such
moments.
Even those as eloquent as President Ronald Reagan have recognized
the difficulty. Said Reagan at Arlington National Cemetery in 1982: I
have no illusions about what little I can add now to the silent
testimony of those who gave their lives willingly for their
country.
Knowing we fall short, we will remember the mothers, fathers,
sisters and brothers absent from the barbeques and picnics marking the
start of summer.
We will ponder the unimaginable courage of
those who volunteer to put themselves in harms way.
We will
honor their memory by striving to keep America strong and
free.
And we will keep showing up, however feeble our words might
be.
Of all my daily duties as a member of Congress the most
important is advocating for constituents, particularly veterans. Since
taking office, my staff and I have helped obtain over $3 million owed to
veterans and their families.
I have had the honor of
nominating young Idahoans to our military academies; watched service
members swear to defend the Constitution against all enemies; presented
long-delayed medals to deserving heroes; and attended funerals of the
fallen. Those experiences reinforce my commitment to do everything
possible to keep the nations promises to those who serve.
As you
enjoy your holiday weekend, please take a moment to reflect. Remember
the sacrifice of those who make your leisure possible, who keep your
family safe, and who remind us of the price of
liberty.
Happy Memorial Day.
