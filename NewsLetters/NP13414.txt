Washington Can
Do Better in New Year
The clock is about to
strike midnight on 2013.
It has been an interesting
year.
The biggest story of the year is the failure of
Obamacare.
Throughout all of my travel, from Tarkio to Hannibal and Kansas
City to Kahoka, the number one concern I heard from constituents was
uncertainty about how Obamacare would impact them personally.
As we
have seen in recent months, Obamacare just does not work, and the
failed rollout and millions of cancellation notices have only raised more
questions in the minds of Americans.
The economy has
slowly improved, but growth is not strong enough.
Unemployment
remains too high, making the job search difficult for millions of
Americans.
Small businesses still report too many roadblocks to expanding
their companies and creating new jobs.
For those of us
who like to get stuff done, it was a frustrating year.
However,
2014 is a new year.
Mark Twain said that an optimist is a
daydreamer more elegantly spelled.
Its hard to argue with such a
distinguished Missourian, but I believe that Washington has an opportunity
to do better.
We need to work to make the United States
the best place in the world to do business.
While government does
not create jobs, it can work to reduce taxation, litigation, and
regulation.
We can work to decrease our dependence on foreign oil,
while creating good-paying jobs right here at home.
And we can
continue to push for an end to Obamacare.
My hope for the
New Year is that Congress will work together to help set the table for
economic growth.
