News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
How do I write the newsletter this week and keep it civil?
Deep
breaths I suppose. This week, your United States Congress voted to turn
off the military retiree cuts that passed just before Christmas. If
you've been receiving this newsletter for a while, you know how
bewildered and frustrated I was that Congress decided to cut military
pensions in the first place. I voted against it twice. So the fact that
Congress, after much hemming and hawing, decided to undo the cuts they'd
just passed should have been a major win to me. But. the leadership in
the House and Senate decided to cover the cost of undoing the military
retiree cuts by cutting Medicare.
You read that right. Your elected representatives apparently can't find
any more savings throughout the trillion-dollar federal bureaucracy so
we must need to cut troops pensions. And now that the legislative
branch has realized that we made a promise to the troops and should
probably keep it, the next best idea they have is to cut from Medicare.
Here's an alternative idea. How about cutting our foreign aid budget
instead of troop pensions (or Medicare)? Quick back-of-the-envelope
math will tell you that paying for the cost of replacing the military
retiree cuts will require a little more than a 1% cut to our $50
billion state /foreign operations budget. Surely the countries we're
sending all of this borrowed money to will understand (especially the
countries that hate us) that from the perspective of the American
people, our nation's veterans and our senior citizens must come first.
Just when I think that the business in Washington can't get any
crazier, it does. I'm really at a loss for words here. I have drafted a
piece of legislation that would replace the Medicare cuts with foreign
aid cuts. If you all have any other ideas, please let me know. As
always, I'm anxious to hear what you think - on this or anything else.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

Richard

Dear
Friends,
How
do
I
write
the
newsletter
this
week
and
keep
it
civil?
Deep
breaths
I
suppose&#8230;
This
week,
your
United
States
Congress
voted
to
turn
off
the
military
retiree
cuts
that
passed
just
before
Christmas.
If
you&#8217;ve
been
receiving
this
newsletter
for
a
while,
you
know
how
bewildered
and
frustrated
I
was
that
Congress
decided
to
cut
military
pensions
in
the
first
place.
I
voted
against
it
twice.
So
the
fact
that
Congress,
after
much
hemming
and
hawing,
decided
to
undo
the
cuts
they&#8217;d
just
passed
should
have
been
a
major
win
to
me.
But&#8230;
the
leadership
in
the
House
and
Senate
decided
to
cover
the
cost
of
undoing
the
military
retiree
cuts
by
cutting
Medicare.
You
read
that
right.
Your
elected
representatives
apparently
can&#8217;t
find
any
more
savings
throughout
the
trillion-dollar
federal
bureaucracy
so
we
must
need
to
cut
troops
pensions.
And
now
that
the
legislative
branch
has
realized
that
we
made
a
promise
to
the
troops
and
should
probably
keep
it,
the
next
best
idea
they
have
is
to
cut
from
Medicare.
Here&#8217;s
an
alternative
idea&#8230;
How
about
cutting
our
foreign
aid
budget
instead
of
troop
pensions
(or
Medicare)?
Quick
back-of-the-envelope
math
will
tell
you
that
paying
for
the
cost
of
replacing
the
military
retiree
cuts
will
require
a
little
more
than
a
1%
cut
to
our
$50
billion
state
/foreign
operations
budget.
Surely
the
countries
we&#8217;re
sending
all
of
this
borrowed
money
to
will
understand
(especially
the
countries
that
hate
us)
that
from
the
perspective
of
the
American
people,
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
and
our
senior
citizens
must
come
first.
Just
when
I
think
that
the
business
in
Washington
can&#8217;t
get
any
crazier,
it
does.
I&#8217;m
really
at
a
loss
for
words
here.
I
have
drafted
a
piece
of
legislation
that
would
replace
the
Medicare
cuts
with
foreign
aid
cuts.
If
you
all
have
any
other
ideas,
please
let
me
know.
As
always,
I&#8217;m
anxious
to
hear
what
you
think
&#8211;
on
this
or
anything
else.
