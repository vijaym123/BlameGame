Dear Friend:
This week marks the one-year anniversary of the historic and devastating floods that swept our region last September. This was the costliest natural disaster in our states history, prompting a federal disaster declaration for 18 Colorado counties and causing destruction of homes, businesses, roads, and the tragic death of nine Coloradans: Joey Howlett, Wesley Quinlan, Wiyanna Nelson, Danny Davis, James Bettner, Carroll CT White, Gerald Gerry Boland, Evelyn Starner, and Patricia Goodwine.
Last week, I joined Lyons Mayor John OBrien to tour some of the areas and businesses hit the hardest by the flood, including Meadow Park, Vrain Market, Lyons Fork Restaurant, Two Rivers Foods, and the Red Fox Expeditionary Gear store. In the wake of the flood, I continue to be inspired by the resilience, determination, and compassion of Colorado residents.
In the past year I have worked tirelessly to secure the funding and disaster declarations necessary to ensure residents can rebuild their homes and businesses.
I was an original cosponsor of legislation to increase access to flood insurance and was the lead Democratic sponsor of legislation to increase emergency funding to address imminent hazards to life and property caused by floods, fires, and severe storms. I have worked closely with the Colorado congressional delegation to secure over $300 million in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funds, and I continue to advocate on behalf of families in our district to ensure that federal agencies are responsive to their needs and providing them with the relief they deserve.
While we have made significant progress in our cleanup and recovery efforts, I am committed to continuing to work with state and federal agencies until all citizens and businesses that were impacted are fully recovered.
As always, my staff and I stand ready to assist you as you seek out assistance from federal agencies. If you need help with a flood recovery matter, please don't hesitate to reach out to us by calling (303) 484-9596 [Boulder] or (970) 226-1239 [Fort Collins].

Yours Truly,
Jared Polis
