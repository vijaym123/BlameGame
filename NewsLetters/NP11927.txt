Goodlatte Holds Hearing
on Executive Overreach &ldquo;Preventing the President from overstepping the boundaries of his constitutional authority is not about partisan politics.
It
is about preserving the fundamental premise of our constitutional design: that a limited government, divided into three separate branches exercising
enumerated powers, is necessary to protect individual liberty and the rule of law.&rdquo;
This morning, I convened a
hearing
of the House Judiciary Committee to examine legislative
approaches to addressing President Obama&rsquo;s failure to faithfully execute our laws. This hearing builds on the Committee&rsquo;s examination of
this issue last December, where we heard from legal scholars regarding the constitutional concerns raised by President Obama&rsquo;s pattern of
refusing to enforce our laws.
Article II, section 3, of the U.S. Constitution
declares that the President &quot;shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.&quot; However, President Obama has failed on several occasions
to enforce Acts of Congress that he disagrees with and has also stretched his regulatory authority to put in place
policies Congress has refused
to enact.
For example, now that Obamacare isn&rsquo;t working, President Obama is rewriting his own law on a whim, even though the law
doesn&rsquo;t give him the authority to do so. President Obama boldly asserts that he has a &quot;pen and a phone&quot; to change our laws through
executive decrees, but we have a Constitution and we must abide by it.
President Obama&rsquo;s decision to ignore the constitutional limits on
his authority undermines the rule of law and threatens the individual liberty that our system of separated powers is designed to
protect. Click
