CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER'S REACTION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
IMMIGRATION
ANNOUNCEMENT
President Obama has
publicly stated 22 times that he can't ignore or create his own
immigration law.

quotes .
The unilateral actions announced this week by President
Obama are an affront to the American people and an egregious violation
of our Constitution.
America is a nation of laws, and we
function best when those laws are applied fairly and equally.
President Obama's claim that picking and choosing which laws to enforce is
the best solution for our broken immigration system is a serious abuse
of power and irresponsible.
Our Founding Fathers crafted a
carefully divided system of government, with checks and balances and
a purposeful separation of powers.
According to the
Constitution, legislative power is delegated to Congress, while the President's
authority is to enforce the laws, not write the
laws.
President Obama has made 22 public declarations that he cannot, should not,
and must not write his own immigration laws.
He should be a man
of his word.
Instead, his actions have precipitated a
Constitutional crisis.
For that reason, we will use every
prudent legislative means possible to limit the execution of President
Obama's plan to selectively enforce immigration law, including responsible
efforts to restrict funding, action on the appointment process, and
through policy initiatives.
We just completed an election
where the American people clearly expect us to work together.
Republicans are listening, but President Obama is saying "no" to the
American people through his unilaterlal actions.
The first step
to meaningful immigration reform is to secure the border, and I was
hopeful President Obama would work with Republicans in 2015 on border
security legislation.
Instead of working with Republicans on real
solutions, President Obama has chosen to throw fuel on the fire and
make our immigration problem worse, with a clear invitation for a greater
influx of future illegal immigrants to bypass our naturalization
process.
We are committed to preserving the integrity of our
Constitution, and we must not allow President Obama to arbitrarily abuse
the role and purpose of the Executive Branch.
