Dear David,
June 1 st
marks the start of the 2014 hurricane season. Before the season begins,
please make sure that you are prepared for the possibility of a
tropical storm or hurricane.
Storm systems can change quickly and
unexpectedly, so preparation is the best way to injury or damage to
property. Here are a few tips to help you
prepare:
Monitor weather conditions , and follow directions from
your state and local officials. Follow up-to-date advisories on
storms impacting Central Florida and your local community by
visiting
http://www.floridadisaster.org .
The National Hurricane Center
is the official source for
the latest tropical storm forecast from the National Weather Service.
Visit its site for the latest information on tropical weather,
including the National Hurricane Center advisories, tracking maps, and
satellite and radar images:
http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ .
Know your evacuation route,
and follow
evacuation orders from local officials immediately. Learn more at
http://www.ready.gov/evacuating-yourself-and-your-family .
Create an emergency plan,
and have
an emergency contact number for someone out-of-state, who knows where
you are in the event of an emergency. Learn more at
http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan .
Know your
local emergency contact information.
Ive compiled a list of
our local, state, and federal government contacts at
Grayson.House.Gov/hurricanepreparedness .
Build an emergency supply kit , which includes essential
items to help you and your family survive for at least 72 hours during
and after a hurricane. Find a checklist in
www.Ready.Gov/Build-A-Kit . Your emergency supplies kit should include items
such as:
Water (one gallon of water per-person,
per-day, for at least three days, for drinking and sanitation, is
recommended) and food (at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food,
as well as a can-opener)
Portable, battery-powered
radio or television with extra batteries, flashlight, matches in a
waterproof container, signal flare, and fire
extinguisher
First aid kit, first aid manual (available at
www.ready.gov ), and a supply of prescription
medicines
Extra set of car keys, credit card and cash, as well as personal
identification, insurance policy paperwork, and other important family
documents
Map of your area and Family Disaster
Plan
Special items for infants, such as formula and
diapers
Pet food and extra water for your
pet
Dust mask (to help filter contaminated air), plastic
sheeting and duct tape to shelter-in-place
Wet wipes,
garbage bags, and plastic ties for personal
sanitation
Talk to your insurance agent
about
flood insurance, and review your homeowners policy. Flood insurance is a
cost-effective way to prepare financially for floods. To learn more
about your risk and flood insurance, visit
www.floodsmart.gov .
