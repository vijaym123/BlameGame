Photo of the Week:
I had a blast meeting with the Chapman family
from Raleigh in my office on Thursday. Talking to these young ladies
was a bright spot in the midst of a very busy week. They were visiting
D.C. during summer vacation and a member of my office gave them a tour
of the
Capitol!
Weekly
Update:
There has been a historic
exodus of Americans from the workforce. While unemployment sits at 6.1
percent, it would actually be much higher if we were to factor in the
total number of people who have given up looking for work. When
accounting for this, the unemployment rate would instead sit at an
astounding 10.2 percent .
This is inexcusable, and for reasons like this, the Republican Party
continues to fight to
create jobs and grow a healthy
economy.
To help fight unemployment, the House passed
four bills this past week to
improve affordability and educational access
for young
Americans. This legislation will provide higher-ed opportunities to those
wishing to pursue this pathway and also contributes to solid economic
growth. Because college graduates are more likely to acquire higher
paying jobs and better benefits, the House of Representatives made it a
priority to pass legislation so that every American has the
opportunity to succeed.
I hope that you'll mark on
your calendar
the Third Annual Recruit-A-Vet Employment Fair
this August. For the past two years my office has hosted this
employment fair to help match local businesses with veterans seeking
employment. The members of our military have made incredible sacrifices
to protect our freedom, and we need to do everything we can to make
sure they have the best career opportunities possible when they return
to civilian life.
More than half of the
veterans attending have found jobs through the Recruit-A-Vet employment
fair.
This
year, the event will be held on Wednesday, August 13th from 10 a.m.
1 p.m. at
the Dennis Wicker Center in
Sanford. Veterans can
click here
to find more information and register to attend. Employers
interested in participating in the job fair should contact Pat Fitzgerald in
my Dunn office at 910-230-1910.
Please contact my office if you have any
questions or concerns. We are here to assist you however we
can!

I
had a great time meeting with members of the North Carolina National
Guard this week and discussing new ways we can assist
them.
In between votes on the House Floor, I was able
to meet with Pinecrest High School students Alexan Bailey and Robert
Bahner. Both are in Washington this week for the National Teenage
Republican Leadership Conference and made time to swing by my D.C. office
to see me. I really loved meeting with these bright, conservative
leaders!
