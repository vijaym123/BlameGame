The Days Ahead
This past
Thursday Americans all across our great land gathered together for
Thanksgiving. It was a time for fellowship and sharing and to give thanks for
the many blessings we enjoy.
It was also a time for reflection on the challenges we face -- either
as an individual, a family, a community, or a
country.
As your representative in Washington, I'm
honored and grateful for the opportunity to continue the work that is
needed to forge solutions to those challenges we face as a nation. In the
weeks to come, Congress will be faced with numerous items of concern
-- whether it be the ongoing problems we are seeing with the rollout
of the president's health care law or forging a bipartisan agreement on
the nation's fiscal priorities.
Foremost in our mind will be the economy. In order to turn in a
more positive direction, we simply must put in place policies to help
promote greater growth, opportunity and job
creation.
We won't address all our challenges overnight,
but we must do our best to tackle them head-on. This work will require
constructive input from all sides and I'm hopeful that the new year
will bring new solutions.
As always -- and particularly during this time of year -- we keep in
our thoughts the brave men and women of our military. So many will be
away from home this holiday season, and we pray for their safe
return.
May God bless them and continue
to bless this nation as we work to take action to tackle the
challenges before us.
