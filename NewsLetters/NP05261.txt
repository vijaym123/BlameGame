Dear Friend,
Thousands of you responded to our most recent issue survey, and the results show that people are concerned with the real issues. Like Dianne in Plymouth County who wrote:
&ldquo;I'm 68 years old, and I believe that we must (1) leave a better environment to future generations and (2) ensure that everyone who works for a living makes a living wage.&rdquo;
Or Scott in Worcester County, who said
&ldquo;Campaign finance reform and the Constitutional Amendment to [undo] Citizens United. If we don't do something to change the way Big Money controls government, nothing else is going to make much difference.&rdquo;
If you haven&rsquo;t taken our survey yet, there&rsquo;s plenty of time to have your voice heard.

I think one of the most touching responses came from Catherine in Middlesex County. She chose combating gun violence, protecting our environment, and protecting women&rsquo;s reproductive rights as her top concerns on our survey. And as her comment, she wrote:
"As a young woman with a young child, these are what matter to me. I want my son to grow up in a safe, healthy, and respectful world.&rdquo;
Breaking the NRA&rsquo;s hold on Congress and passing better gun safety laws. Unleashing the clean energy revolution. Protecting the rights of women to make their own health decisions.
These fights aren&rsquo;t just about us. They&rsquo;re the fights that will determine what kind of America we hand off to our children.
If you haven&rsquo;t taken the survey yet, you haven&rsquo;t missed your chance.
