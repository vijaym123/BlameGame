Rep. Lipinski Says
M ore Must Be Done
To Address VA
Issues
Statement
from Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3):
Based on the reports that have emerged over
the past few weeks, it is clear that the VAs treatment of some
veterans
we dont know yet how many
has been shameful.
This is
totally unacceptable.
I expect the VA and the President to quickly
get to the bottom of this, resolve the problems impeding veterans from
quality and responsive health care, and to make sure those that failed
these brave men and women are held accountable.
This must
include reviews at facilities like Hines, as well as a national assessment
of our entire VA health care system.
Letting one VA executive
resign who was already slated to retire only serves to reduce the trust
Americans have in the accountability of their
government.
Much more must be
done."
This week, Congressman Lipinski joined with 389 members of the House
to pass the VA Management Accountability Act.
The bill makes it
easier for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to fire or demote career
employees and managers who are found to be involved in cases of
negligence or mismanagement.

Rep. Lipinski Calls Water Transportation
Bill
a Victory for District and Nation
Bill Includes
Lipinskis Provision Barring
Dumping in Lucas-Berg in
Worth
(A view of the Lucas Berg
Nature Preserve off 111th St. in Worth from the
SouthtownStar)
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) is applauding a rare
bipartisan victory in Washington as the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA), which funds maintenance and modernization of our
nations inland waterways and ports, was passed this week in the House of
Representatives.
A long time in the making, the bill addresses
many issues that Lipinski has been working on, including language he
added barring the Army Corps from dumping dredged materials from the
Cal-Sag Channel at the Lucas-Berg Confined Placement Facility in
Worth.
Since I was
first elected to Congress, one of my top local priorities has been to
remove Lucas-Berg as the Army Corps designated site for dumping dredged
materials from the Cal-Sag, Rep. Lipinski said.
I am very happy
that I was able to work with my colleagues to get this language into
the WRRDA that will soon become law.
This is very good news for
the Village of Worth and local residents.
I know what a great
gem the Lucas Berg Nature Preserve is to so many people.
I will
continue to work with the Army Corps to find a place for the dredged
materials that is not so close to homes, businesses, and parks.
What else is in the bill for
the Third Congressional District?

Rep. Lipinskis Bill Honoring Fallen Chicago
Firefighter from Mount Greenwood Moves Forward
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) has announced that
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has approved his
bill to honor fallen firefighter Herbie Johnson.
The bill would
rename the post office in Chicagos Mount Greenwood community after
longtime Chicago Fire Captain Herbert Herbie Johnson.
The
54-year-old died two years ago while fighting a house fire on the citys
South Side.
Captain Johnson heroically served area residents for over 32 years, paying
the ultimate price protecting the neighborhoods he loved, Rep.
Lipinski said.
This bill not only honors him, but all first responders
who bravely put their lives on the line every day for people they
dont even know.
This bill insures that Johnson, his family and the
sacrifices of all first responders will not be forgotten by future
generations.

Rep. Lipinski
Announces
2014 Congressional Art Competition
Winner
Congressman Dan Lipinski has announced
that Brian Pfister, a senior at Oak Lawn Community High School, is the
Third Congressional Districts winner of this years Congressional
Art Competition.
Pfisters digital photograph, entitled Salute,
shows an image from an Air Force Ceremony involving his brother.
The photograph will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for the next
year alongside the winning pieces from congressional districts across the
country.
We are fortunate to have so many talented artists in the district
with such diverse skill sets, said Rep. Lipinski.
While I was
impressed by all the artwork that my office received, Brians moving
photograph really brings out that patriotic feeling that many of us share
when we think about the brave men and women putting their lives on
hold, and often in harms way, in order to serve this great
nation.
I congratulate Brian on this honor and thank all the young men and
women who participated in this years competition for the thought and
care they put into their art.
