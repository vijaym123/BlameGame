Friend -- You&rsquo;ve got an important choice to make in this election -- and it&rsquo;s not going to wait until tomorrow.
By midnight tonight you have to decide: Stay on the sidelines or
get in the game?
If we dig deep right now and redouble our efforts together, we can win close Senate races all over the country. Your help could mean the difference between a Senate that works for everyone and a Senate that works for just a privileged few.
I&rsquo;ve been doing everything I can to help strong Democratic women like Kay Hagan in North Carolina, Michelle Nunn in Georgia, and Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky overcome a vast flood of outside money.
Across the country, at least six Democratic women could win tight races and help Democrats save the Senate.
But without your help, that won&rsquo;t happen.
The election is in just four days -- this is the moment to make an impact and swing the outcome of race after race.
So don&rsquo;t wait another second to act.
Will you pitch in to support a strong Democratic Senate? Your gift will be triple-matched until the final end-of-month deadline at midnight.

Let me tell you something I&rsquo;ve learned:
When women participate in politics, the effects ripple out far and wide.
We could finally have a Senate that favors compromise over obstruction
-- that fights for equal pay, raises the minimum wage, and gives hard-working families a fair shot at the American Dream.
But if you don&rsquo;t act before midnight, our chance to keep control of the Senate -- and make historic gains for women and families -- is likely to be overwhelmed by all that unaccountable money on the other side.
Please join me. Pitch in to help Democratic women win. Remember: Your gift will be triple-matched until midnight.
Thank you,
Hillary Clinton
