Hi there,
As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, there are dozens of toss-up races I have to keep my eye on.
But take it from me: one of the top races in the whole country is happening right now in Illinois.
Cheri Bustos is in a tight race that, quite frankly, could go either way. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose someone like her.
That makes every quarterly fundraising deadline -- like the one coming up in 8 days -- all the more important.
Can you chip in $5 to help Cheri?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$35 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
I&rsquo;ve met a lot of outstanding Americans -- true fighters for our Democratic values -- but Cheri really stands out. She goes to work every day to defend the promises made to our seniors and children and to protect the rights of every American.
But the radical right&rsquo;s campaign machine is flush with outside money and revving up to launch attacks against Cheri. Please, we can't let her fall behind. Can you chip in $5 or more today? http://act.cheribustos.com/donate
Thanks for supporting Cheri,
