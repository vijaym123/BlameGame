ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
February 13, 2015
D e ar Friends,
President Obama recently
announced his proposed 2016 budget, a fiscal roadmap for America that focuses
on helping the middle-class and improving funding for education, all
while maintaining fiscal
responsibility.
The Presidents budget proposal
would use the tax code to make work, education, and child care more
affordable for millions of hard-working American families. It would bring
an end to the budget cuts implemented in 2011 as part of the now
infamous sequester.
Sequestration was a mindless attempt at
austerity that has been counterproductive to our economic recovery. I
voted against the sequester in 2011 because it was bad policy then,
just as it is bad policy today, and I applaud the President for
proposing a budget that reverses those unnecessary
measures.
In addition to ending the
sequestration, President Obamas proposed budget includes $70.7
billion in discretionary funds for education, a 5% increase over the
previous year; a $1.5 billion increase in
Head Start
funding; and a
$750 million increase in grants for states to develop and expand
preschool programs for 4-year-olds who come from low-income households. As
we all know, New York has led the way in the fight for universal
pre-k, and I am pleased to see the President follow the Empire States
lead by making early academic engagement a national
priority.
Committing ourselves
to improving Americas aging infrastructure has long been a priority
of mine in Congress. Infrastructure spending not only helps rebuild
our structurally deficient transportation system; it also puts Americans
to work. I was pleased to see the Presidents budget tackles this
issue by making a significant, $94.7 billion investment in the Department
of Transportations budget. In addition, the Presidents plan offers
a $478 billion (over six years) transportation reauthorization
proposal, and a $144 billion commitment (also over six years) for transit and
passenger rail programs.
The Presidents budget also prioritizes our
environment, with increases to the Environmental Protection Agency budget and
money directed at expanding green technologies and programs that will
go a long way toward dealing with the issue of climate
change.
As we debate the
FY 2016 budget in Congress, my Republican colleagues would be
well-served to take a real long look at the Presidents proposal, which would
reduce the tax burden on the middle-class, support our public schools,
increase infrastructure spending to promote job growth, and end the
damaging and unpopular sequestration. This budget puts the American
people first, and in the coming weeks and months I am hopeful that we
will be able to make this proposal a reality.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
