Food stamp benefits will go up for families living on Rota, Tinian, and the Northern Islands. Governor Eloy Inos, Secretary Laurie Ogumoro, Administrator Walter Macaranas, and I announced the decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week. Governor Inos has been very supportive of my efforts to raise benefits and get the Northern Marianas in to SNAP. Mr. Macaranas and his staff at the Nutritional Assistance Program did the difficult work of gathering the price data that justified the increase. I thank everyone involved in this success.
Food stamps up 62% for Rota, 28% for Tinian - Families on Rota, Tinian, and the Northern Islands will get a big boost in food stamp assistance beginning as soon as May 1. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced this week that it was approving a 62 percent increase in benefits for families on Rota and the Northern Islands and 28 percent for families on Tinian. A family of four on Rota will see benefits go from $444 per month to $719. On Tinian the same family will get $568. The extra money not only helps those in need; it is also good for store owners, shippers, and government revenues because that money is spent immediately and goes straight into the local economy.
The decision to increase benefits was based on data collected by the Commonwealth's Nutritional Assistance Program and submitted some time ago. I have been encouraging USDA to act on the data without requiring any more analysis from the Commonwealth, a point I made again in a meeting with Ms. Audrey Rowe, Administrator of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service last week. Her office then okayed the Rota, Tinian, and Northern Islands increases. Funding is not an issue; before the increases NAP was expecting to have a surplus of several million dollars this year. So there may be enough money to raise benefits for families on Saipan, as well. Agriculture is still crunching the numbers. But the agency made the right decision to approve the Rota, Tinian, and Northern Islands increase now, rather than wait for the Saipan analysis to be completed. The table below shows what the monthly increase will mean for families:

FY15 spending requests submitted to Appropriations Committee -
"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." - U.S. Constitution, article I, section 9.
Each year the Commonwealth government and individuals and organizations in the Northern Mariana Islands receive millions of dollars in support from the federal government. As Congress begins the work of appropriating those funds for fiscal year 2015, I, along with most other Members, have sent to the Appropriations Committee my recommendations of which federal programs to fund and how much to provide each. Although the Committee bases its spending decisions in part on ideology and budgetary realities, Member recommendations are also important-a kind of voting where even "non-voting" Delegates are equal. In fact, we received word this week that one of my recommendations has already been approved by the Committee (see next story). Altogether I supported over 200 programs for funding, most bring money directly to the Marianas or serve a purpose that could be important to my constituents, research into combat-related traumatic brain injury, for instance. See the complete list at http://sablan.house.gov/ .
Appropriators approve report on services to rural veterans - Veterans in the Northern Marianas do not have direct access to the Veterans Benefits Administration. So, I asked that language accompany this year's Veterans Department appropriation
requiring a report on how services are being delivered in rural areas of America, like our islands - and the Appropriations Committee agreed. The report is to include the number of veterans served, the type and frequency of services available, as well as an evaluation on the effectiveness of these efforts, their costs, and the resources needed to enable VA to provide more services to rural veterans. This kind of data can be the basis for legislation or administrative actions, improving care to the veterans in our islands and to underserved veterans throughout our country.

Ms. Lou Atalig and Ms. Bernice Ravell, staff of the CNMI Occupational and Vocational Rehabilitation office, Planner Lillian S. Ada and Executive Director Pam C. Sablan of the Council on Developmental Disabilities, and Executive Director Sid Seman of the Office of Personnel Management visited their congressional office in Washington this week. They had been attending conferences and seminars related to the work of helping people in the Northern Marianas develop to their full potential. The group advised congressional staff on pending legislation. Thank you for sharing your experience and expertise.
Omnibus Territories Act ready for Senate floor vote - The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee filed its report on S. 1237 , the Omnibus Territories Act, this week, clearing the way for a vote on the Senate floor. The bill includes a five-year extension of the immigration transition period in the Northern Mariana Islands from 2014 to 2019. This will allow for the continuing gradual phase-out of the Commonwealth-only (CW) Transitional Worker program and E2C investor status. The transition period is also essential for the bar on claims of asylum in the NMI, which protects our rebounding, parole-based tourism industry and the transition will allow military contractors to use H visa workers for build-up construction, if necessary. The bill originally included conveyance of submerged lands to the Northern Mariana Islands; but I was able to move that provision separately and get it enacted into law last September. Other provisions of S.1237 that benefit the NMI include a study of island energy aimed at improving efficiency and lowering costs. I want to thank the former Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who introduced S.1237, and the new Chair, Mary Landrieu (D-Louisiana), who is now moving the bill forward.

This week, Marianas High School's Alternative Education Program graduated eight students who had to work especially hard to earn their diplomas. I added my congratulations at the ceremony by presenting Congressional Commendations to Mr. Frankie A. Ramangmou and Mr. Mathew D. Aaron for their perseverance and inspiring efforts. Thank you for inviting me to attend this uplifting event. Our community is proud of you all and what you have accomplished. Go, Dolphins!
Northern Marianas gains seat on HELP Subcommittee - Recent resignations and membership changes required Democrats on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce
to rebid their subcommittee assignments. Due to my seniority I was able to remain on the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, which has jurisdiction over education from birth to high school graduation. I also used the rebidding opportunity to move to the Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee. HELP, as the subcommittee is called, has jurisdiction over job training and retirement security, two issues of particular importance in the Northern Marianas. The HELP Subcommittee also had responsibility for parts of the Affordable Care Act, which has provided the NMI with millions in new funding, but which also requires some serious revision going forward. My seat on HELP may give me more of a voice in improving Obamacare as it applies to the territories.
