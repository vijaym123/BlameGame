HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
[cid:image003.jpg@01CF1EB4.AAB970A0]
$12.7 m. is largest consolidated federal grant ever for PSS - Our public school students will have the benefit of $12.7 million in federal support this school year, an increase of $3.9 million over last year. More funding for education has been one of my top goals as your Congressman and we are definitely making progress. This year's consolidated grant will be the largest that PSS has ever received. But, having returned to my seat on the Education Committee in this Congress, I intend to keep pushing for more equitable federal funding for our students in the long-overdue reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Commissioner of Education, Dr. Rita Sablan, and I discussed how PSS will use the new money this week. One of the programs I think most important is the Cooperative Education Program that PSS is ramping up so that more of our high school graduates are trained and ready for entry level jobs in the Northern Marianas economy. A college education is still the best guarantee of higher income over a lifetime, but college is not for everyone. And even college bound young people can benefit from a year or two of work before they go on to higher education. The Cooperative Education Program is funded in part with PSS's share of the $150 per CW worker fee paid by employers of non-US workers. To date the Commonwealth has received over $1.3 m. in training fees.
House approves new $32.5 m. for NMI food program - The farm bill passed by the House this week promises more food for Northern Marianas families in need, beginning as early as October 2015. A $2 million study of how to bring the NMI into the national food stamp program, SNAP, will begin this year. Then an additional $13.5 m. will be available for benefits in fiscal 2016 followed by another $8.5 million in both 2017 and 2018. This new money is on top of the annual food stamp grant the Commonwealth currently receives - $12.148 m. in the FY14 appropriation
the President signed on January 17. All together, NMI food stamp funding over the next five years could total $93 million. This will pump up our economy and create jobs. It also goes a long way toward giving us parity with the rest of the American family. Right now SNAP provides $931 a month for a family of four in Guam. In the NMI, without SNAP, the same family only gets half that, $444. I moved to the House Agriculture Committee in 2011 to pursue the goal of equal food aid for NMI families. After three long years, that goal is now within reach. The Senate is expected to approve the farm bill, H.R. 2642 , next week; and the President should sign it into law quickly.
Farm programs benefit the Northern Marianas - In addition to the special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - SNAP - pilot for the Northern Mariana Islands, the House-passed farm and food policy bill creates or strengthens a number of programs of help to the NMI and other parts of rural America. For example:
*
The Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program. NMI farmers use this program to make up for the high cost of shipping equipment, seeds, and fertilizer to our islands and of shipping their produce to off-island markets.
*
Rural Energy for America (REAP). Marianas Business Plaza recently was awarded the maximum grant that REAP provides for farmers and rural businesses to install solar arrays and other renewable or efficient energy systems.
*
Non-insured crop insurance. This program is protecting a number of NMI farmers against crop losses that can result from typhoons or other natural disasters. Premiums are minimal and can be waived for farmers who fall below certain income thresholds.
*
Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Program. These grants and loans support for training, education, outreach, and technical assistance for beginning farmers or ranchers, a program NMI farmers have accessed through the Farm Service Agency out of Hawaii or Guam.
*
Community Facilities loans and grants. Priority is given to health care, education and public safety projects. Last year, the CNMI Department of Public Safety paid for two new police cruisers with grant funds from this program.
*
The Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Program. This new initiative will allow SNAP recipients to double the amount of food they get when they buy fruits and vegetables directly from local producers. Up to $20 m. in grants will go to farmers markets each year to subsidize SNAP purchases; and, if proven successful over the next five years, the program will be expanded nationwide.

Janet Guerrero, Linda Denorcey, Helen Sablan, Anthony Reyes, Josie O'Mallan and Dr. Norman Okamura were in DC this week for meetings on Health Information Technology. Converting patient medical records to a digital format can result in time-savings for doctors, nurses, and patients, can reduce error rates in providing treatment, and can improve billing practices. The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation has made some important strides in IT, supported by federal funding.
4x more energy assistance for NMI families - The higher Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program - LIHEAP - grant that territorial delegates worked on for over two years was announced officially this week. Each territory gets a 400 percent increase. That means $214,000 to help low-income households in the Northern Marianas. Funding had been frozen since 1984, despite increases in the cost of electricity in the islands. We were able to convince Secretary Sebelius to use her administrative authority to increase the LIHEAP territorial set-aside from 0.135 to 0.5 percent. Her decision is well-justified: Poverty levels in the U.S. territories are three to five times the national average and the price of electricity is two to four times higher. The Commonwealth's Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, which distributes the LIHEAP funds to eligible households in the Marianas, has said it is working on how the increased benefits will be distributed.
GOP backs status, even for illegal immigrants - House Republicans released their blueprint for immigration reform
at their annual policy retreat on Thursday. Included in the GOP principles is a commitment to allow even persons who entered the country illegally to continue to live and work here, if they can speak English, understand American civics, will not be a public charge, and meet certain other conditions. While Republican leaders have not provided any specific legislation to accomplish their goals, Democrats reacted to the release of principles as a sign that legislative activity on immigration remains a possibility this year.

Mr. Arnold Palacios, CNMI Secretary of Lands and Natural Resources, was invited to testify before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard this week
in his capacity as Chairman of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council. Chairman Palacios gave the Council's perspective on reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The hearing examined the progress made and the challenges faced in transitioning to sustainable fisheries management. The House Natural Resources Committee begins its hearings on reauthorization of the Magnuson Act on February 4.
Lori Faeth designated as the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Areas - Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has named Ms. Lori Faeth to be Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Insular Areas, until an Assistant Secretary can be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Ms. Faeth is presently Interior's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs. She has also worked for then-Governor Janet Napolitano in Arizona, as Senior Policy Advisor for Natural Resources, Agriculture, Energy and Environment. Congratulations to Ms. Faeth. I look forward to continuing the long-standing partnership with the Office of Insular Affairs under her leadership.
State of the Union speech highlights may help the Northern Marianas - President Barack Obama delivered his fifth State of the Union address to the U.S. Congress and the American people on Tuesday. The President called for a year of action and set out a number of policy areas he will be focused on. As a Member of Congress, my first responsibility is legislative, but I also have to watch for executive branch actions that may benefit the Northern Marianas. And some of the President's plans could be important for us:
Helping workers get skills required for good jobs - The President said he will renew his push to connect community colleges training programs with the needs of business for skilled workers and to increase the number of "learn and earn" job apprenticeships. Additionally, the President wants Congress to increase funding so workers of all ages have access to training.
Helping workers save for retirement - Small businesses in the Northern Marianas and throughout the nation rarely offer employee retirement plans. So the President unveiled a "myRA" savings account to fill the gap. Similar to the Roth individual retirement account, "myRA" savings would be backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. A pilot program will begin later this year, administered by the U.S. Treasury Department.
Encouraging energy efficiency and clean power - The President will be working with states and territories to cut the waste of energy, which raises costs for consumers. He plans to set new energy efficiency standards for appliances to help consumers cut their electricity bills. The President's clean energy policies will also reduce the risks of climate change, which particularly threaten islands and ocean life.
GI bill and military tuition assistance complaint system launched - Veterans returning to school and having problems with deceptive practices or predatory loans programs can get help from a new online consumer complaint system. Launched this week, the new system allows veterans, service members and their families to report problems with any educational institution that gets funding through the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the DOD Military Tuition Assistance Program. The Veterans Administration has distributed over $34 billion since 2009 when the post-9/11 program began. And that kind of money attracts fraudsters. Some veterans have paid for questionable degree programs that provide few job prospects. Feedback collected through the new system will help identify bad actors and ensure that high quality academic and student support services are available for members of the military community, who receive educational support from the federal government. For more information or to submit a complaint, go to http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/feedback.asp.
