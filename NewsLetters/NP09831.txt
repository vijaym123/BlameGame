Dear Friend,
This Sunday, we look forward to
celebrating Mothers Day.
Across our state there are exceptional
women
mothers, wives, daughters, aunts and friends
who are central
to our families and communities.
Mothers hold a special and
beloved role in the lives of our children and I believe the love, patience
and guidance they teach is an important foundation of our
society.
As fundamentally important as these women are, I wanted to take a
moment to update you about some important work in Congress that will
benefit the women in our lives, and our families in
Utah.
H.R. 377, the Paycheck Fairness
Act
Trends show that across our country, and our state,
families increasingly rely on more than one income and many mothers are
a part of todays workforce.
Unfortunately, as a country we
still see that women are paid, on average, 77 cents for every dollar a
man earns for the same work.
Inequitable pay practices not only
create significant financial hardships for many women and for their
families, but perpetuate an underlying wrong.
I believe all workers
deserve fair compensation for their work product and I support making
certain that women in our families are not subject to this kind of
discrimination.
That is why, again this year, I cosponsored H.R.
377, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which ensures that women are paid the
same amount as their male counterparts for the same work.
This is
an important bill that will promote economic opportunities and
security for women and their families.
H.R.1830, Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act of
2013
Many constituents I have spoken with have told me
heartbreaking and inspiring stories about how breast cancer has
affected their families.
After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most
prevalent cancer among women with almost 1 in 8 women developing
breast cancer in their lifetime.
Over the course of the past several
decades, the federal government, private entities, and charitable
donations have invested billions of dollars in breast cancer research,
which has yielded much in terms of diagnosis and treatments.
However, not enough has been gained in terms of prevention, prevalence, and
mortality rate of the disease.
That is why I cosponsored H.R.
1830, the Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act.
This bill
would help better coordinate and leverage public and private investments
in breast cancer research and work to identify and advance promising
leads for prevention and treatment.
As always, Im
eager to hear your thoughts and hope you will
stay in
touch with me .
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
