Dear Friends,
Calling all middle and high school girls! If you are between 8-15 years old, or have a daughter, relative or friend that age, save the date and
share this email ! I will be hosting two FREE &ldquo;When I Grow Up&hellip;&rdquo; events in San Francisco and East Palo Alto on March 28 in celebration of Women&rsquo;s History Month.
Whether you want to be the President of the United States, a congresswoman, a doctor, a rocket scientist or a police officer, this gathering will inspire you to make your dreams come true. You will hear from exceptional women who have broken down barriers and made history in their fields.
I hosted the very first of these events in 2012 and it was so inspiring and successful that we have made it an annual tradition in March. We are finalizing the speakers list and will share it with you on my website shortly. Space is limited, so sign up early!
