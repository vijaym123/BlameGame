Dear Friend,
We Must
Restore Common Sense to Washington
As I travel around Virginias
Fifth District, I constantly hear from
constituents who are astounded and upset by
the manner in which the federal government
operates at times. They are often irritated
by the misuse of taxpayer funds and the
poor management of federal agencies.
The governments inability to
fulfill many of its fundamental
responsibilities due to incompetence or a
lack of diligence disturbs us all. Recent
examples of this mismanagement include the
response to the Ebola crisis, the
unconscionable mistreatment of our veterans
in the Veterans Affairs health system, the
Secret Services failure to protect
the White House and the first family from
fence-jumpers, the botched rollout of the
federal healthcare website
which
has cost us hundreds of millions of dollars
and countless other examples.
Americans are also understandably very
frustrated when the government wastes the
peoples money on bizarre activities,
as Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma points
out each year in his annual
Wastebook,
a report outlining dozens of examples of
egregious government initiatives. In
Coburns latest study, he found that
our government funded a grant to study the
benefits of giving rabbits Swedish massages
and another grant to examine whether
Wikipedia is sexist.
Here in the Fifth District, we have seen
troubling examples of this lack of common
sense at the federal level, and I have
introduced several bipartisan bills to
address those issues. I introduced H.R.
2937,
the
Commonsense Permitting for Job Creation
Act , because the Army Corps of
Engineers refused to grant a permit for the
development of an industrial park that
would attract jobs to the Martinsville and
Henry County area because no company had
yet committed to building a facility. Yet
no company would build a facility at this
park unless the permits were approved. My
bipartisan bill would remove this obstacle
to job growth while ensuring compliance
with environmental protocols.
I also authored H.R. 5610,
the
Healthcare Consumer Privacy Act , when
the Department of Health and Human Services
denied a constituents request to
remove his personal information from
Healthcare.gov, even though he chose not to
purchase insurance through the site. My
bipartisan legislation would require HHS to
delete profiles at a users request
so their personal information is not
vulnerable to cyberattacks.
The American taxpayer pays a substantial
portion of their earnings to fund
government and will not tolerate
incompetence, waste, or abuse on the
governments part
nor should
they. They expect the government to be
proactive, diligent, and capable of
performing its intended functions. I am
committed to continued oversight of all
federal agencies and programs to weed out
wasteful spending and ensure that core
government functions are carried out
efficiently and effectively.

Army
veteran Sam Farris of Hurt was presented
with long overdue medals, including a
Purple Heart, that he earned for his
distinguished service to our nation in
Korea and Vietnam. Robert also had the
honor of presenting him a flag that had
been flown over the U.S. Capitol.
Robert
visited the Seminole Trail Volunteer Fire
Department in Charlottesville and presented
L.F. Wood and Chief Danny Tawney with a
flag.
Sincerely,
