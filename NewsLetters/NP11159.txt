Friend,
The National Republican Congressional Committee, Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s political arm, just named
all three
of my opponents as top contenders in its Young Guns program.
That means they&rsquo;re throwing every last ounce of support behind them -- meaning big money -- so one of them can unseat me. It doesn&#39;t even matter to them who I end up running against - they are committed
to attacking me regardless.
It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they throw millions at us to roll back everything we&rsquo;ve been fighting for.
We can&#39;t sit idly by and let that happen. We need to fight back against the national Republican establishment&#39;s extremist backers, or we could be in deep trouble. Can I count on you to help us fight back?
Chip in $3 or more towards our March 31st goal to fight back against Boehner&#39;s attacks.
The Tea Party&rsquo;s billionaire donors and their vicious attacks shouldn&rsquo;t determine who wins in 2014.
My team has already told you that we&#39;re facing an important reporting deadline on
March 31st .
We have $7,254 to raise by
Monday . The national media and the NRCC will be watching our numbers very closely. That&#39;s why it&rsquo;s critical you take a stand today. We need to show them that we have what it takes to fight back.
Pitch in $3 or more towards our March 31st goal, right now.
I&rsquo;m grateful for your help.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
We are the only district in the country where the NRCC named more than one &quot;top contender.&quot;
That means they&rsquo;re in this&mdash;are you?
