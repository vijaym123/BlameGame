Dear Neighbors,
Happy Thanksgiving. I believe we all have a lot to be thankful for this
year.
I am thankful to have my health, my family, and the opportunity to
serve my neighbors in Congress. It has been a great 11 months in office
so far, and I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of my
neighbors.
I am also thankful for our troops, both at home and abroad. These
patriots serve their country and protect our freedom to enjoy food,
family and togetherness on this special day.
I am thankful because our troops continue to serve whether it is a
holiday or not. They are making the sacrifice to be away from their
families on this holiday so that our families can remain safe. I am
thankful for these families and all military families this holiday
season.
I hope you will keep our heroes in our hearts and minds as we celebrate
this holiday.
Sincerely,
Tammy Duckworth
Member of Congress

Style

Tables
carry
NO
style
declarations.
Only
declare
border,
cellspacing,
width,
bgcolor
(background
color)
and
alignment
attributes
to
a
table.
Think
of
the

as
providing

you
place
within
it.

COMMENT:
This
will
help
simplify
the
styling

within
the
table.
COMMENT:
The
TD
is
where
you
may
declare
a
default
font-family,
font-size,
color
(this
applies
to
the
font
only),
text-alignment
(left/right/centered)
and
a
valign
(alignment
of
the
content
from
top/middle/bottom
of
the
TD
cell.
COMMENT:
By
declaring
a
default
style
on
the
TD,
you
avoid
the
need
to
apply
a
style
to
every
paragragh,
DIV
(Division),
header,
or
other
text
in
your
content.
COMMENT:
You
may
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the
HTML
code
of
this

table
you
will
see
how
these
concepts
are
being
applied.
COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of
style,
size
and
table
attributes
that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
shorter
tables
on

of

to
form
one
very
long
series
of
tables
and
avoid
the

Dear
Neighbors,
Happy
Thanksgiving.
I
believe
we
all
have
a
lot
to
be
thankful
for
this
year.
I
am
thankful
to
have
my
health,
my
family,
and
the
opportunity
to
serve
my
neighbors
in
Congress.
It
has
been
a
great
11
months
in
office
so
far,
and
I
look
forward
to
continuing
my
work
on
behalf
of
my
neighbors.
I
am
also
thankful
for
our
troops,
both
at
home
and
abroad.
These
patriots
serve
their
country
and
protect
our
freedom
to
enjoy
food,
family
and
togetherness
on
this
special
day.
I
am
thankful
because
our
troops
continue
to
serve
whether
it
is
a
holiday
or
not.
They
are
making
the
sacrifice
to
be
away
from
their
families
on
this
holiday
so
that
our
families
can
remain
safe.
I
am
thankful
for
these
families
and
all
military
families
this
holiday
season.
I
hope
you
will
keep
our
heroes
in
our
hearts
and
minds
as
we
celebrate
this
holiday.
Sincerely,
Tammy
Duckworth Member
of
Congress
