WATCH: Rep. Garrett recaps his legislative work in 2013
Dear Friend,
As the year comes to a close, I hope you will take a moment to watch this video, a recap of the legislative initiatives I pursued during the first session of the 113th Congress. It is an honor and a privilege to represent New Jerseys Fifth Congressional District, and I look forward to serving you and fighting to uphold the Constitution in 2014.
May God bless you and your families as you celebrate this holiday season, and may God bless the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
