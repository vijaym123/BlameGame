David -- I don&rsquo;t like putting a spin on things. So I&rsquo;ll just come out and say it: in this day and age, it&rsquo;s appalling to see extremists try and dictate women&rsquo;s health care choices.
Instead of working to raise the minimum wage, protect the environment, and ban discrimination in the workplace against LGBT workers, some in Congress are focused on dictating what women can and can&rsquo;t do.
David, I think that&rsquo;s wrong.
Fortunately, this corner of Illinois has a leader in Congress who fights against the right-wing infatuation with restricting our rights -- my son, Congressman Brad Schneider. I raised Brad to be firmly pro-choice.
We&rsquo;ll fight day and night to protect the values we believe in, because women -- and women alone -- have the right to make decisions about their own bodies.
My son is in a tough fight for re-election. If you care about protecting a woman&rsquo;s right to choose, please, make a small donation to Brad&rsquo;s campaign.

Thank you so much,
