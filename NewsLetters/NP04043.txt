A Step Forward for Native Children
When I first became involved in public service in North Dakota more
than twenty years ago, I knew I had to do whatever it took to improve
conditions for Native American children in our state and across the
country. This has perhaps been the strongest driving force for me as I
wake up each morning, and something I'm always thinking about while
serving in the U.S. Senate. Earlier this week, I was proud to be part
of yet another step forward.
I had the honor of attending the annual White House Tribal Nations
Conference, along with representatives from all five of our state's
tribes and the nation's 566 federally recognized tribes.
During President Obama and the First Lady's visit to Standing Rock in
June, I spoke to the President about the need to improve much-needed
resources and support for Native children and he saw these issues
firsthand. He listened to the stories of some of the youth from
Standing Rock and was struck, as I am, by their strength and
resilience. This visit helped inspire and encourage him to launch a new
federal initiative - Generation Indigenous
- that will focus on providing Native
youth with greater opportunities to break down the barriers that have
stood in their way of succeeding for far too long.
This initiative complements my efforts in the Senate to stand up for
Native children and families. The first bill I introduced in the Senate
would create a Commission on Native Children. It would take an in-depth
look at the vast array of challenges these kids have been facing, and
create concrete recommendations and solutions to address these issues.
My bipartisan bill, which I introduced with Republican Senator Lisa
Murkowski from Alaska, is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate. I
will keep working to make sure this becomes law because we can't afford
to leave behind any of our kids any longer.
A couple weeks ago, I brought together a group of top experts on Native
American issues, policymakers, and federal agency representatives to
have an in-depth discussion about strategies to prevent and treat the
effects of traumatic stress on children in Indian Country. This has
been an overwhelming challenge for our Native youth and I know my bill,
coupled with Generation Indigenous, could help us turn the tide.
If by the time I leave office, whenever that may be, and the conditions
for Native children haven't improved, I'll consider that a failure. I
will always remain a strong voice for Native youth and families, and
will work tirelessly alongside them to change outcomes, not stand in
their way - it's our collective responsibility and, just like them, we
can't ever give up.

A
Step
Forward
for
Native
Children
When
I
first
became
involved
in
public
service
in
North
Dakota
more
than
twenty
years
ago,
I
knew
I
had
to
do
whatever
it
took
to
improve
conditions
for
Native
American
children
in
our
state
and
across
the
country.
This
has
perhaps
been
the
strongest
driving
force
for
me
as
I
wake
up
each
morning,
and
something
I'm
always
thinking
about
while
serving
in
the
U.S.
Senate.
Earlier
this
week,
I
was
proud
to
be
part
of
yet
another
step
forward.
I
had
the
honor
of
attending
the
annual
White
House
Tribal
Nations
Conference,
along
with
representatives
from
all
five
of
our
state's
tribes
and
the
nation's
566
federally
recognized
tribes.
During
President
Obama
and
the
First
Lady's
visit
to
Standing
Rock
in
June,
I
spoke
to
the
President
about
the
need
to
improve
much-needed
resources
and
support
for
Native
children
and
he
saw
these
issues
firsthand.
He
listened
to
the
stories
of
some
of
the
youth
from
Standing
Rock
and
was
struck,
as
I
am,
by
their
strength
and
resilience.
This
visit
helped
inspire
and
encourage
him
to
launch
a
new
federal
initiative
-
Generation
Indigenous
-
that
will
focus
on
providing
Native
youth
with
greater
opportunities
to
break
down
the
barriers
that
have
stood
in
their
way
of
succeeding
for
far
too
long.
This
initiative
complements
my
efforts
in
the
Senate
to
stand
up
for
Native
children
and
families.
The
first
bill
I
introduced
in
the
Senate
would
create
a
Commission
on
Native
Children.
It
would
take
an
in-depth
look
at
the
vast
array
of
challenges
these
kids
have
been
facing,
and
create
concrete
recommendations
and
solutions
to
address
these
issues.
My
bipartisan
bill,
which
I
introduced
with
Republican
Senator
Lisa
Murkowski
from
Alaska,
is
currently
awaiting
a
vote
in
the
Senate.
I
will
keep
working
to
make
sure
this
becomes
law
because
we
can't
afford
to
leave
behind
any
of
our
kids
any
longer.
A
couple
weeks
ago,
I
brought
together
a
group
of
top
experts
on
Native
American
issues,
policymakers,
and
federal
agency
representatives
to
have
an
in-depth
discussion
about
strategies
to
prevent
and
treat
the
effects
of
traumatic
stress
on
children
in
Indian
Country.
This
has
been
an
overwhelming
challenge
for
our
Native
youth
and
I
know
my
bill,
coupled
with
Generation
Indigenous,
could
help
us
turn
the
tide.
If
by
the
time
I
leave
office,
whenever
that
may
be,
and
the
conditions
for
Native
children
haven't
improved,
I'll
consider
that
a
failure.
I
will
always
remain
a
strong
voice
for
Native
youth
and
families,
and
will
work
tirelessly
alongside
them
to
change
outcomes,
not
stand
in
their
way
-
it's
our
collective
responsibility
and,
just
like
them,
we
can't
ever
give
up.
