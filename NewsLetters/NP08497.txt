The
Tragic Situation in Iraq
It is difficult to watch the
tragic situation that is unfolding in Iraq, a crisis which deserves close
attention from the White House and Congress.
Our highest
priority is the protection of U.S. citizens in the region.
The United
States should be working with other countries in the area to assess
effective measures which will preserve and protect our specific national
security interests.
The president should develop a
plan to protect our specific national security interests and then work
closely with Congress concerning any involvement in the
conflict.
We should be highly concerned about providing any
equipment or weaponry that could be captured by the ISIS or obtained by
other bad actors in the region.
I was a guest on Doug
Wright's radio show recently to discuss this situation in more detail, and
you can listen to it here:

Building a Majority for a New Reform
Agenda
Last week I delivered a speech to the Faith and Freedom Coalition to
identify a path forward for enacting an agenda that restores the proper
role of government, reenergizes our economy, and creates the
conditions in which all Americans have a fair chance to pursue happinessand
find it.
Starting now, we must win support for our vision: a
conservative reform agenda that redesigns our unwieldy welfare state
and modernizes our outdated government programs so that they address
the growing lack of opportunity for the millions of working families
of
or
aspiring to
the middle class.
I dont
think I need to go to great lengths to explain the problems with our
current government.
There is no shortage of facts showing that
our fiscal situation is unsustainablebut it suffices to say that we
have become far too comfortable with the word
trillion
in our
political discourse.
More and more every day we are
confronted with the real-life consequences of a government that tries to do
things that it cannot and should not do.
Our federal
government is so overextended that it is failing to fulfill even its most basic
responsibilitieslike caring for our veterans, securing our borders,
enforcing our laws, and conducting a coherent foreign policy that, at
the very least, does no harm to our national security.
To
fix our broken government its not enough simply to
roll back
ineffective policies that concentrate power in Washingtonwe must also
roll out
bold conservative reforms that empower the people
closest to the problems to test and refine solutions that work best for
their communities.
