Dear David,
As I look back on the past year, there is much to be proud of but at the top of the list are the personal relationships nurtured throughout the year and the good work we did together.
In Illinois, though much still lies before us, we made marriage equality a legal reality and voted to raise the minimum wage. Nationally, we continued to fight for a better future -- one with stronger communities, a healthy environment, and a growing economy that works for all of us.
Looking to 2015, I am excited to build on what we have accomplished together. I remain committed to the belief that our best days still lie before us, and I have no doubt that if we dedicate ourselves to the values and priorities that define us, we will find new ways to move our country forward.
I hope you will join me as we continue on this path and ensure we keep the promise to our next generation that they will inherit a future both prosperous and secure.
Wishing you and your loved ones a healthy and happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Brad
