A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
January 9, 2014
Dear Friends,
The Senate convened at noon on Tuesday for the 114th Congress, and
Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., officially became Majority Leader as
Republicans took control of the Senate for the first time in six years.
On Wednesday I was officially named chairman of both the
Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Senate Select Committee
on Ethics
.
I am very proud to be allowed to chair these two Senate committees
on which I have served for several years. It turns out I
am the only Republican senator named to chair two committees for the
114th Congress.
The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs will play a key role in
ensuring that critical reforms passed by Congress last year are
implemented to improve services and health care delivery for our
nation's veterans. It is so important to our nation and to Georgia. The
work of the Ethics Committee is critical to maintaining the integrity
of the United States Senate.
As a veteran myself - having served in the Georgia Air National Guard
from 1966-1972 - and a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee
since joining the Senate in 2005, I have long been focused on improving
the quality and timeliness of care at Department of Veterans Affairs
healthcare facilities across the country.
We are at a critical moment in history with the VA, and I will be
fiercely committed as chairman of the Senate committee to making sure
the Department of Veterans Affairs seizes this moment and rises to meet
the challenge of implementing these reforms for our nation's veterans.
There's no greater calling for us in Congress than to bring value back
to the VA and our veterans. I look forward to leading the charge in the
Senate to implement the solutions to the VA's problems and to help
instill a system of success and accountability for the future.
I will also continue to serve on the Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pension, and the Senate Committee on Finance.
Additionally, I have been selected to once again serve on the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations.
I look forward to the important work that lay ahead for each of these
committees.
KeystoneXL Pipeline
This week, along with Georgia's new Senator David Perdue, R-Ga., I
again co-sponsored legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline
.
The Keystone legislation was the first bill introduced in the Senate
for the 114th Congress and is co-sponsored by all other Republican
senators in addition to six Democrats, highlighting the importance of
the project to secure America's energy future, improve national defense
and create tens of thousands of jobs for Americans.
Upon passage, a presidential permit would no longer be needed to
approve the project, which authorizes TransCanada to construct and
operate the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf
Coast under Congress's authority enumerated in the Commerce Clause of
the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8.
The American people are still struggling in today's economy, and they
expect and deserve Washington to cut red tape and unleash America's
energy resources, which will create American jobs, ensure America's
energy security and reinforce relations with our largest trading
partner. Building the Keystone XL pipeline is an important step toward
meeting these goals.
We've had six years of missed opportunities for the Senate, under
Democratic control, to take up legislation that addresses Americans'
priorities. It's time we start putting America's issues on the
president's desk. Sen. Perdue and I urge the president to reconsider
his threat to veto the bipartisan, job-creating Keystone XL pipeline
and to finally take the opportunity to work with Congress to find
solutions the American people want.
Retired Marine Corps Colonel Named Senate VA Committee Staff Director
As my first official act as chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans'
Affairs, I named retired Marine Corps Colonel Thomas G. Bowman staff
director for the committee
In addition to his military service, Tom also spent almost a decade
working in the Department of Veterans Affairs, including as chief of
staff under two former VA Secretaries.
I am proud to appoint a veteran of our armed services to this important
role. Tom's experience in the military and his years of experience at
the Department of Veterans Affairs will be invaluable as we conduct
oversight in the coming months to ensure that the reforms set forth in
the Veterans' Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 are carried
out on behalf of our nation's veterans. Read more here
Army Retirement Policy Reversal
In November, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I led a
bipartisan group of colleagues in sending a letter
to U.S. Army Secretary John McHugh over the Army's
treatment of a significant number of captains and majors who are former
non-commissioned officers and who were being forced to retire at their
highest previous enlisted rank.
We were concerned about the Army's use of Enhanced-Selective Early
Retirement Boards, which would have resulted in a significant decrease
in lifetime retirement benefits for the impacted soldiers -- as much as
$1,000 per month or more for some, or just more than $1 million over a
40-year retirement in the case of a captain forced to retire as a
sergeant first class.
This week, Secretary McHugh officially announced a reversal of this
policy
. I am thrilled Secretary McHugh responded quickly and is taking
the steps necessary to rectify this situation and allow these deserving
men and women to retire at the rank they have earned. You can read more
about this issue in the Army Times' article here
.
Student Financial Aid Form
This week, I also joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing
the FAST Act, a bill to simplify the process of applying for and
receiving federal financial aid to attend college, to allow year-round
use of Pell Grants, to discourage over-borrowing and simplify
repayments.
The bill would reduce the questions some 20 million Americans must
answer to apply for federal financial aid down to a single postcard-
called the "Student Aid Short Form"-and would inform high school
students in their junior year of the amount they'll receive in federal
aid to help pay for college.
Simplifying the overly complicated federal aid application and giving
students and parents the opportunity to receive aid information easier
and earlier will be an important tool in helping them choose a
postsecondary institution that is right for them. Additionally, by
protecting students from over-borrowing and helping them to better
understand their repayment options, students will be better equipped to
responsibly repay their loans. Read more about the legislation here
.
What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will debate S.1, the KeystoneXL pipeline bill,
the first priority of the Republican-controlled Senate.

Johnny Isakson

Dear
Friends,
The
Senate
convened
at
noon
on
Tuesday
for
the
114 th
Congress,
and
Senator
Mitch
McConnell,
R-Ky.,
officially
became
Majority
Leader
as
Republicans
took
control
of
the
Senate
for
the
first
time
in
six
years.
On
Wednesday
I
was
officially
named
chairman
of
both
the
Senate
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs
and
the
Senate
Select
Committee
on
Ethics .
I
am
very
proud
to
be
allowed
to
chair
these
two
Senate
committees
on
which
I
have
served
for
several
years.
It
turns
out
I
am
the
only
Republican
senator
named
to
chair
two
committees
for
the
114 th
Congress.
The
Senate
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs
will
play
a
key
role
in
ensuring
that
critical
reforms
passed
by
Congress
last
year
are
implemented
to
improve
services
and
health
care
delivery
for
our

It
is
so
important
to
our
nation
and
to
Georgia.
The
work
of
the
Ethics
Committee
is
critical
to
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
United
States
Senate.
As
a
veteran
myself
&ndash;
having
served
in
the
Georgia
Air
National
Guard
from
1966-1972
&ndash;
and
a
member
of
the
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
since
joining
the
Senate
in
2005,
I
have
long
been
focused
on
improving
the
quality
and
timeliness
of
care
at
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
healthcare
facilities
across
the
country.
We
are
at
a
critical
moment
in
history
with
the
VA,
and
I
will
be
fiercely
committed
as
chairman
of
the
Senate

implement
the
solutions
to
the
VA's
problems
and
to
help
instill
a

for
the
future.
I
will
also
continue
to
serve
on
the
Senate
Committee
on
Health,
Education,
Labor
and
Pension,
and
the
Senate
Committee
on
Finance.
Additionally,
I
have
been
selected
to
once
again
serve
on
the
Senate
Committee
on
Foreign
Relations.
I
look
forward
to
the
important
work
that
lay
ahead
for
each
of
these
committees.
KeystoneXL
Pipeline
This
week,
along
with
Georgia's
new
Senator
David
Perdue,
R-Ga.,
I
again
co-sponsored
legislation
to
approve
the
Keystone

Upon

a
presidential
permit
would
no
longer
be
needed
to
approve
the
project,
which
authorizes
TransCanada
to
construct
and
operate
the
Keystone

pipeline
from
Alberta,
Canada,
to
the
U.S.
Gulf
Coast
under
Congress's
authority
enumerated
in
the
Commerce

of
the

Article

The
American

It's

Sen.
Perdue
and
I

veto
the
bipartisan,
job-creating
Keystone
XL
pipeline
and
to
finally
take
the

Retired
Marine

Colonel
Named
Senate
VA
Committee
Staff
Director
As
my
first
official
act
as
chair
of
the
Senate
Committee

Veterans'
Affairs,
I
named
retired
Marine
Corps
Colonel
Thomas
G.

In

to
his
military
service,
Tom
also
spent
almost
a
decade
working
in
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs,
including
as
chief
of
staff
under
two
former
VA
Secretaries.
I
am
proud
to
appoint
a
veteran
of
our
armed
services
to
this
important
role.
Tom's
experience
in
the
military
and
his
years
of
experience
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
will
be
invaluable
as
we
conduct
oversight
in

coming
months
to

that
the
reforms
set

Army
Retirement
Policy
Reversal
In
November,
U.S.
Senator
Patty
Murray,
D-Wash.,
and
I
led
a
bipartisan
group
of
colleagues
in
sending
a
letter
to
U.S.
Army
Secretary
John
McHugh
over
the
Army's
treatment
of
a
significant
number
of
captains
and
majors
who
are
former
non-commissioned
officers
and
who
were
being
forced
to
retire
at
their
highest
previous
enlisted
rank.
We
were
concerned
about
the
Army's
use
of
Enhanced-Selective
Early
Retirement
Boards,
which
would
have
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
in
lifetime
retirement
benefits
for
the
impacted
soldiers
--
as
much
as
$1,000
per
month
or
more
for
some,
or
just
more
than
$1
million
over
a
40-year
retirement
in
the
case
of
a
captain
forced
to
retire
as
a
sergeant
first
class.
This
week,
Secretary
McHugh
officially
announced
a
reversal
of
this
policy .
I
am
thrilled
Secretary
McHugh
responded
quickly
and
is
taking
the
steps
necessary
to
rectify
this
situation
and
allow
these
deserving
men
and
women
to
retire
at
the
rank
they
have
earned.

this
issue

Student
Financial
Aid
Form
This
week,
I
also
joined
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
in
introducing
the
FAST
Act ,
a
bill
to
simplify
the
process
of
applying
for
and
receiving
federal
financial
aid
to
attend
college,
to
allow
year-round
use
of
Pell
Grants,
to
discourage
over-borrowing
and
simplify
repayments.
The
bill
would
reduce
the
questions
some
20
million
Americans
must
answer
to
apply
for
federal
financial
aid
down
to
a
single
postcard&mdash;called
the
"Student
Aid
Short
Form"&mdash;and
would
inform
high
school
students
in
their
junior
year
of
the
amount
they'll
receive
in
federal
aid
to
help
pay
for
college.
Simplifying
the
overly
complicated
federal
aid
application
and
giving
students
and
parents
the
opportunity
to
receive
aid
information
easier
and
earlier
will
be
an
important
tool
in
helping
them
choose
a
postsecondary
institution
that
is
right
for
them.
Additionally,
by
protecting
students
from
over-borrowing
and
helping
them
to
better
understand
their
repayment
options,
students
will
be
better
equipped
to
responsibly
repay
their
loans.
