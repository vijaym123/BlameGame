According to the United Sates Constitution (Article II Section 3), the executive branch, headed by the president, has a duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
Currently, when the Department of Justice stops enforcing a law on the grounds that it is unconstitutional, the Attorney General is required to report to Congress. The Faithful Execution of the Law Act,
H.R. 3973 , which I cosponsored, strengthens this provision by requiring all federal officials (not just the Attorney General) who stop enforcing a law to report to Congress the exact reason for this non-enforcement, regardless of whether it is being done on constitutional or policy grounds.
Whether or not they fit with his agenda, the President of the United States has a duty to enforce our nations laws. Its not optional. Its Constitutional.
Yours in service,
Randy
