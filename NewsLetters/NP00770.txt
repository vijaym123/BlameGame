Dear David,
Communication is at the heart of serving as your
member of Congress. Representing you is what I was elected
to do. I want to hear from you about your needs, about our
community, and about what we can do to make it better
together.
Thats why Im proud to announce the launch of my re-designed
congressional website. Apart from getting freshened up with a new
look, the site is more user friendly and emails to my office can now be
sent while you are on the go. Tour requests can be submitted
easily on your phone. Contact information is easier to find, text can
be made bigger or smaller for those who need it, and it adapts to
smart phones and tablets. Everything was done to ensure that you get
what you need from my office, including options for the hearing
impaired and the addition of a new accessibility feature for the visually
impairedthe ability to change the websites font size.
I am
also proud that this new website highlights photos from local
Rochester photographers.
Please take the time to explore the
new website to learn about how I represent you and Rochester in
Washington. There are updated issue sections on topics relevant to our
district, like trade, photonics and optics, and economic development; my
legislative priorities like protecting the public health, serving our
veterans and fighting for equal rights for all; as well as up-to-date
information on the range of services that my office has to offer
you.
To visit the new website, please visit
louise.house.gov . And dont forget everywhere else you can go
to stay in touch with my efforts in Congress:
