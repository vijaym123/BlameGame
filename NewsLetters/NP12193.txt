While Washington continues to play politics as
usual, Montana families are being burdened with higher energy costs
while new regulations from Washington are threatening good paying jobs in
our energy sector. It is time to end the politics and truly work
toward an "all of the above" energy plan that will help keep energy prices
low for hardworking families and help create good Montana jobs. And
many Democrats and Republicans alike think the Keystone XL pipeline is
a good place to
start.
The State Department recently released their final environmental impact
report , showing that the Keystone XL pipeline
will have no significant impact on the environment, yet the President
refuses to act. The Keystone XL pipeline was introduced more than five
years ago, but the President's delay in approving this project has
cost
800
good paying Montana jobs and valuable
tax dollars that could be used to fund schools, infrastructure, and
emergency services. That's why I
testified
at the
Keystone XL pipelines five-year Red Tape Anniversary in September of
last year and asked one simple question: "Why are we still waiting?"
If the
President is serious about his "year of action," he should start by approving
a bipartisan job-creating effort: building the Keystone XL pipeline.
As your voice in Washington, I welcome your thoughts on this issue and
invite you to take a moment to answer the question
below.
Do you support building the Keystone XL
pipeline? Yes - The
Keystone XL Pipeline will provide much needed jobs to our economy and
help keep energy prices low No - The Keystone XL Pipeline is not something we should
