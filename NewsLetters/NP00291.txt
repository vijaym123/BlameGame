Cheri&rsquo;s a champion for Illinois working families. She&rsquo;s committed to defending Medicare and Social Security, ending
Citizens United , and creating good paying jobs.
That&rsquo;s why Speaker Boehner and National Republicans are so eager to defeat her. We won a tough election last year because of generous supporters like you. If we&rsquo;re going to do it again, we&rsquo;ve got to stay on track. Will you donate $5 (or more!) to help us get closer to our goal? http://act.cheribustos.com/urgent-deadline
