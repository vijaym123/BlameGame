Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Proud to support Hobby Lobby and the Green family this week in their
Supreme Court case to ensure that their religious liberties are not
infringed upon by government mandate.
Lesser Prairie Chicken Designation
This week the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced their listing of
the Lesser Prairie Chicken as "threatened" under the Endangered Species
Act--a move we have worked to prevent in Oklahoma for many years.
In Oklahoma we take pride in our land and do our due diligence to
preserve it for future generations. We also understand the importance
of wildlife conservation and have exhibited this conviction in our
tireless efforts to prevent the Lesser Prairie Chicken from becoming
listed as endangered.
As a state, Oklahoma has been a model for conservation practices,
working for well over a decade and spending over $27 million on
preservation efforts. As a member of the House Natural Resources
Committee, I have worked alongside committee members and the rest of
the Oklahoma delegation in order to preserve the Lesser Prairie Chicken.
But this work has gone unnoticed. Our efforts have been ignored by an
Administration that can't seem to get enough of overregulating the
American people. With listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken as a
threatened species, this Administration has found yet another way to
burden Oklahomans with red tape and stifle productivity.
There is no one size fits all solution. Each state must find the right
balance between regulation and conservation. States need to be given
the freedom to do their job and have their work rightfully
acknowledged.
It was a blessing to meet Mechele Cruz with Muskogee EMS this week. She
was one of the four Oklahomans recognized as a National Star of Life.
Propane Crisis Update
Last week, H.R. 4076, the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through
Transportation (HHEATT) Act of 2014, was signed into law. I cosponsored
and supported this bill because it will allow truckers to more easily
get crucial home heating fuels like propane to areas that need it most.
The propane crisis hit hard in Oklahoma this winter and I was glad to
see the bipartisan effort in finding a solution.
In Durant this week I had the opportunity to see the good things
happening at the Kiamichi Technology Center with its recent expansion.
Thanks to Director Mike Goodwin for showing me around.
Congressional Art Competition Deadline
The deadline for entries in the 2014 Congressional Art Competition is
April 1, 2014.
The Congressional Art Competition gives our many talented high school
students in the Second District a chance to compete to have their
original artwork displayed for a year in the U.S. Capitol.
Additionally, all entries will be on display from April 8 -12 in the
Synar Technology Center at NSU in Muskogee.
A panel of judges will select winners. All winners will be announced at
a ceremony in Muskogee on April 14.
New for the competition this year is all entries must be Oklahoma
themed. We are excited to have this theme because there is so much in
Oklahoma that can inspire students. And what a great way to showcase
our state.
All entries are due to the Muskogee office at 431 W. Broadway, by close
of business on April 1, 2014. Details on contest regulations can be
found on our website at mullin.house.gov, listed under the "Services"
section. Also, anyone seeking additional information should contact
Vivian Loving in our Muskogee district office at (918) 687-2533.

additional accountability measures in the budgeting process and reign
in spending.
