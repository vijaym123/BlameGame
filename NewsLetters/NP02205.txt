Carper's Connection

Dear Fellow Delawarean,
As a veteran, I know firsthand the sacrifices members of our military
make to defend our nation. We have a responsibility to ensure that our
returning heroes have resources and opportunities when they arrive
home, and to make sure they are taken care of long after. Thats why I
host an annual veterans summit with Sen. Coons and Congressman Carney
and leaders from veterans groups from all over the state. Its our
opportunity to hear veterans concerns and develop ways to address them.
We held this years summit on Monday, March 2nd, at the Wilmington
Veterans Medical Center, and had the honor of welcoming the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald. The secretary
toured the Wilmington Veterans Medical Center, met with veteran
leadership to hear their views, held a town hall for the employees of
the medical center, and then traveled to the University of Delaware to
talk to nursing students there about a career with the VA.
Sec.
McDonald
I am proud that we had the opportunity to host the secretary in the
First State. The president nominated Secretary McDonald to head the
Department of Veterans Affairs at a time when reform and leadership was
greatly needed. He has a lot of work to do, but I know he is committed
to providing the veterans who sacrificed so much for us with the care
and benefits they rightly deserve and I will continue working with the
secretary and my colleagues in the Senate to carry out this critical
mission.
If you are a veteran and need assistance, please reach out to my office
at (302) 856-7690 or my veterans page at

Dear
Fellow
Delawarean,
As
a
veteran,
I
know
firsthand
the
sacrifices
members
of
our
military
make
to
defend
our
nation.
We
have
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
our
returning
heroes
have
resources
and
opportunities
when
they
arrive
home,
and
to
make
sure
they
are
taken
care
of
long
after.
That&#146;s
why
I
host
an
annual
veterans
summit
with
Sen.
Coons
and
Congressman
Carney
and
leaders
from
veterans
groups
from
all
over
the
state.
It&#146;s
our
opportunity
to
hear
veterans&#146;
concerns
and
develop
ways
to
address
them.
We
held
this
year&#146;s
summit
on
Monday,
March
2nd,
at
the
Wilmington
Veterans
Medical
Center,
and
had
the
honor
of
welcoming
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Secretary
Bob
McDonald.
The
secretary
toured
the
Wilmington
Veterans
Medical
Center,
met
with
veteran
leadership
to
hear
their
views,
held
a
town
hall
for
the
employees
of
the
medical
center,
and
then
traveled
to
the
University
of
Delaware
to
talk
to
nursing

there
about
a
career
with
the
VA.
I
am
proud
that we
had
the
opportunity
to
host
the

in
the
First
State.
The
president
nominated Secretary
McDonald
to head
the
Department
of

at
a

when
reform
and
leadership
was
greatly
needed.
He

I
