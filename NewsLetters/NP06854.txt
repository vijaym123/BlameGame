CHICAGO SUN-TIMES
US Chamber of Commerce spending another $500,000 to defeat Schneider
David --
This is serious:
Late Friday night, we learned the US Chamber of Commerce is dumping a HALF-A-MILLION dollars on Chicagoland T.V. to attack Brad&rsquo;s progressive record.
This isn&rsquo;t your local business, community-based Chamber of Commerce.
This is a national right-wing front group that's hell-bent on defeating strong Democrats like Brad.
With Karl Rove already on the air against Brad, what we do right now could determine the outcome of this race. David, we&rsquo;re depending on you. Rush $5 or whatever you can to help Brad fight back and get out the facts.
