Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Welcome Cecelia Rose McHenry
Last Friday, August 15th, Giulia and I were overjoyed to welcome to the world our first child, Cecelia Rose.
It has been an amazing week adjusting to my new role as dad but I've enjoyed every second of it.
Giulia and I would like to thank everyone for sending prayers, congratulations, and words of encouragement over the last week.
We are thrilled to begin this new chapter of our lives as a family of three and are so thankful to have been blessed with a beautiful &amp; healthy baby girl.
I Need Your Feedback
Over the past couple weeks much has happened around the world.
The humanitarian crisis on our southern border continues as the crush of illegal immigrants flooding into the United States shows few signs of letting up.
In the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and Hamas has extended into a second month.
Just to the West, the situation in Iraq is deeply concerning as ISIS continues to spread their reign of terror.
Back home in Western North Carolina I heard from numerous constituents worried about the price of necessities like healthcare, gas, and groceries.
With that in mind, I want your opinion on what issue you think is most critical for Congress to address when we return to session next month.

Successful ALWS in Shelby
Once again this year, Shelby and Cleveland County did a fantastic job hosting the American Legion World Series at Shelby High School's Keeter Stadium.
This year marked the
second consecutive victory
for the American Legion team representing Brooklawn, New Jersey.
It also marked the second consecutive year that Shelby
hosted record crowds
as over 110,000 people attended tournament games including a stadium record of nearly 8,000 for the championship game.
I applaud all the residents of Shelby and Cleveland County on another successful tournament and look forward to the World Series returning next August.
