I wanted to share a resource with you that I thought might be helpful. For all the most recent updates, hearings, and reports on the investigation into the IRS inappropriate targeting of conservative organizations, you can visit:
http://www.gop.gov/irs/ .
The IRS has broken the American peoples trust and betrayed their own pledge to enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all. I remain committed to fighting for the answers the American people deserve, and for the consequences that must ensue to ensure that this does not happen again.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
Recently, I sent a
letter
to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting a nonpartisan official be appointed to lead the IRS investigation. I also supported the Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act,
H.R. 2531 , which prohibits the IRS from asking taxpayers questions regarding religious, political, or social beliefs.
