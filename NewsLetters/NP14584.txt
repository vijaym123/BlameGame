Blindsided by empty promises of Obamacare
by: Congressman Stephen Fincher
"If you like your health care plan you will be able to keep your health
care plan. Period." That was just one of the many empty promises
President Obama made to dupe the American people into thinking his
Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was anything more
than flawed.
Today, as the federal government struggles to get Obamacare up and
running, we're able to see just how far the president's promises of
2009 are from reality
In the past two weeks, my offices have received dozens of calls,
letters, and Facebook messages from constituents who have received
notices from their health care providers letting them know their plans
would be discontinued Dec. 31. Meanwhile, hundreds of others are
complaining that their healthcare coverage is changing and their
premiums are skyrocketing as their insurers scramble to come into
compliance with the health care law's thousands of pages of regulations.
When I was elected to Congress, I chose not to enroll into the Federal
Employee Health Benefits program (Congressional health care) that is
available to members of Congress and their staffs. Instead, I kept the
same Tennessee Farm Bureau insurance my family has had for years. It's
the same type of plan that many of my friends in Frog Jump and across
West Tennessee have. Even that plan has seen significant increases in
the premium thanks to Obamacare.
By no means does that compare to the blindside felt by many of my
constituents who thought they were going to be able to keep their
healthcare, but it's something that unites us all - Obamacare is a far
cry from what the president promised it would be.
Just Monday, NBC News reported that the Obama administration "has known
for at least three years" that millions of Americans would receive
cancellation notices from their insurers, thanks to Obamacare. The
network cited four sources that estimate between 50 and 75 percent of
the 14 million Americans who buy their insurance individually will lose
their coverage in 2014. And with the government dictating the types of
policies folks can buy, you bet they'll often cost a lot more, putting
families in a personal financial crisis. Sadly, these realities aren't
unique to West Tennessee. All across the country, millions of
hard-working Americans are seeing drastic changes to their health care
coverage and their premiums go up at an alarming rate. Families are
being faced with the genuine uncertainty these changes create as they
struggle to understand what health care coverage and costs will look
like in 2014 and beyond.
Hearing these first-hand accounts from my constituents each day only
serves to renew my resolve. Moving forward, I will continue to fight to
protect all Americans from this awful law.

Even

&#8211;

you

they&#8217;ll
