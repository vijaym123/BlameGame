Dear Friend,
High school graduation is a special occasion for students, celebrating
their hard-work and success. I recently gave the commencement speech at
James Logan High School in Union City and saw hundreds of bright young
students ready to make their mark on the world. For many, the next step
is higher education. But, the sheer cost of today's college education
can be daunting and worrisome for students and their families.
Rep. Swalwell speaks at the James Logan HS commencement about college
affordability
I understand what many of these young students are experiencing; I was
the first person in my family to attend college, and my hard-working
parents could not afford the cost. I relied on student loans to put me
through college and law school, and am still paying them off today.
Does student loan debt affect you or your family?

Unless we act now, student loan debt will continue to burden students
as they are working to transition to a job, buy a house, start a
business, or get married. That is why I cosponsored H.R. 4582, the Bank
on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. This bill would give
students the opportunity to refinance their student loan debt at the
same low rate being offered currently to new borrowers. College
affordability benefits the entire country, and we must fight to ensure
that a college education is within reach.
As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress.
