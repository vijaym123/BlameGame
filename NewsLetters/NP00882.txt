David, we know we say this a lot: Cheri&rsquo;s the most vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois. But what&rsquo;s it mean? If we&rsquo;re going to keep Cheri fighting for our Democratic values in Congress, we can&rsquo;t afford to miss a single deadline between now and Election Day. David, we still need at least TWO supporters from 60659 before Monday&rsquo;s budget deadline to hit our goal. Can you rush a donation right now?

Whether it&rsquo;s fighting for equal pay or protecting Medicare and Social Security for seniors, Cheri is always looking out for Illinois families.
But David, not everyone agrees with Cheri&rsquo;s middle-class agenda. And if we don&rsquo;t start Cheri&rsquo;s re-election campaign off strong, Illinois&rsquo; 17th could pay the price. Chip in $5 (or more if you can) more today: http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
