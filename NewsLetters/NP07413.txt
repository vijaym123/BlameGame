! When asked a question from an audience member about statehood, he said, Im in D.C., so Im for it.
No, look, I think Ive long believed that D.C. pays -- folks in D.C. pay taxes like everybody else.
They contribute to the overall well-being of the country like everybody else.
They should be represented like everybody else.
The Presidents endorsement of statehood was major. We already have gotten Members of Congress, the top four Senate leaders, and almost half of the Senate Democrats to cosponsor our statehood bill.
The support is building as we prepare for the coming Senate hearing in Senator Tom Carpers committee of jurisdiction.
First Federal Ban on Job Discrimination
Last Monday, President Obama issued an Executive Order (EO) , that prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
The Presidents EO is much like President Franklin D. Roosevelts historic 1941 EO, which prohibited federal government and defense industries from discrimination based on race and national origin.
Currently, 18 states and the District of Columbia ban lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) discrimination, but there is no federal law that prohibits companies from discriminating against their employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Congress must now work to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in order to fully protect LGBT Americans from workplace discrimination, no matter where they work.
Speaking Up Against the Surge in Anti-Home-Rule Riders
On Friday, I took to the House floor to respond to the two most serious anti-home-rule amendments in years, Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) marijuana and Rep. Thomas Massies (R-KY) gun amendments, attached to the Houses Fiscal Year 2015 D.C. Appropriations bill. Please click here
or on the image below for a short clip of my more than 45-minute speech.
I believe I can get these anti-democratic riders removed from the final bill.

Budget and Legislative Autonomy in the Senate Appropriations Bill, and St. Elizabeths Funding
Last Thursday, as I had requested, the Senates fiscal year 2015 District of Columbia Appropriations bill granted D.C. both budget and legislative autonomy , marking the first time ever that an appropriations bill has given both authorities to the District.
Moreover, the bill provides virtually all the funds requested by the Administration, over $250.5 million, for continuing work on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters, currently under construction on the West Campus of St. Elizabeths in Ward 8, as I requested.
This funding, along with the infrastructure for the entire DHS complex already in the ground, shows that the DHS construction will go on!
Breaking Ground for New Jobs at Old Post Office Building
Last week, along with Donald and Ivanka Trump, I broke ground
for a new luxury hotel at the historic Old Post Office building at 1100 Pennsylvania Ave NW.
This project, made possible by my bill, the Old Post Office Redevelopment Act, will yield 700 construction jobs, 300 permanent jobs, and $100 million in D.C. tax revenue over ten years.

Second Arrest at Capitol Complex
The second person since July 18 was arrested last Wednesday
for allegedly bringing a gun into the Capitol complex.
It is a federal offense (40 USC
5104) to carry a gun in the Capitol complex, with a penalty of up to five years imprisonment.
The Kentucky tea party representative, Thomas Massie, who introduced an amendment to the D.C. Appropriations bill earlier this month to bar D.C. from using its local funds to enforce its gun safety laws, seems to be attracting a constituency for his efforts to restore gun rights, as he says, anywhere I can.
See my speech challenging Massie to do something for his own constituents, such as bills allowing guns in federal buildings in Kentucky and elsewhere as well as in the Capitol.
A Morning with District Seniors
Last Monday, I hosted my annual Senior Legislative Day
at the newly constructed Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, my alma mater, where many D.C. seniors went to school.
Hundreds of seniors from D.C. wellness centers joined me in a working lunch to discuss important congressional legislation and action that affects seniors.
We also enjoyed the music of Clarice Labbe Karter, a well-known violinist and teacher of the violin, who is also a senior, and an exercise presentation from William Yates, Associate Coordinator of Older Adults at the YMCA.
The day was wrapped-up with a tour of the school.

The New Silver Line
On Saturday morning, I attended the opening ceremony for the new Metro Silver Line , which includes five new stations in northern Virginia.
Im Ranking Member of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, and therefore was especially happy to see this decade-long project open.
The Silver Line will make it possible for many D.C. residents to get jobs at Tysons Corner and throughout the region. It will also decrease congestion on our roadways, and help improve our regional air quality.
In May of this year, my colleagues and I also succeeded in getting the sixth round of $150 million for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) included in the House-passed fiscal year 2015 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill.
TSA Still Not Recognizing Drivers Licenses
I will be meeting with top Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials
during the August Recess because of the continuing problems of D.C. residents using their D.C. drivers license for purposes of identification, particularly at airports.
The complaints from residents, and even members of the media, about TSA agents not recognizing D.C. as part of the United States have been troubling.
I am looking forward to a sit-down meeting with TSA officials to find a permanent solution in August.
