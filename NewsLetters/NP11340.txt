Celebrate Women&rsquo;s History Month by Standing Up for Women&rsquo;s Economic Progress
Tuesday, March 18, 2014
Dear Friend,
As we celebrate Women&rsquo;s History Month, we recognize the accomplishments of women in our society. I have long fought for women&rsquo;s economic and social equality and as more women adopt the role of breadwinner in American homes, initiatives like equal pay for equal work and work/family balance can improve gender equality and strengthen the middle class.
I wanted to share with you my latest cable access show, Capitol Conversations,
where
I hosted a discussion with Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro and Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress to talk about the Women&rsquo;s Economic Agenda . I hope you will take a few minutes to watch the show to learn about a few of the important initiatives I support in Congress to strengthen women&rsquo;s economic potential.
Outdated policies have created ceilings that stifle women&rsquo;s success. Across the country, sixty percent of low-wage workers are adult women who are trying to raise a family while making minimum wage and often don&rsquo;t have access to paid leave or affordable childcare. In our district, women on average make 79 percent of what their male counterparts make, but are still responsible for 100 percent of their bills. Raising the minimum wage and ensuring equal pay for equal work would help us tear down these outdated barriers to women&rsquo;s economic success.
As you celebrate Women&rsquo;s History Month,
watch our discussion
and share the video with friends and family who may be interested. Policies to advance women&rsquo;s success are not only important steps forward in the ongoing story of women&rsquo;s equality, but commonsense efforts to strengthen the middle class.
Sincerely,
John F. Tierney
Member of Congress
