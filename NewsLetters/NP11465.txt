Dear Friend,
As we head
into tax season, we are hearing more and more stories about ID theft,
scams and hacking that target peoples tax
information.
Im writing to you today to raise awareness and to let you know about
ways to protect yourself, signs that may indicate theres an issue
and resources for you if you should experience fraud.
Protect Yourself from
Fraud
Recently, weve been hearing about more and
more scams out there that prey upon residents by looking or sounding
like official communications from federal agencies. Dont give out
personal information, including your Social Security Number, unless you
have reached out to the agency or have verified the requester is
legitimate. Conduct verification by calling a published phone number for the
agency, not a number provided to you by the caller.
For more
about protecting yourself or getting help if you think your information
security has been breached,

From Washington: Protecting You
from Government Waste and Abuse
One of
my ongoing crusades as your Congressman is to stop waste and taxpayer
abuse by the Federal Government.
Government abuse takes many
forms: unfunded mandates, abuse of eminent domain, wasteful spending and
regulations that erode our constitutional rights. The House has been
hard at work on a number of measures that seek to address these
important issues.
Here is a round-up of some of important consumer and
taxpayer protection measures that weve passed in the House over the
last few weeks:
The
Unfunded Mandates
Information and Transparency Act
(HR899), which will
enhance transparency and awareness of federal mandates and hold Congress
and federal agencies accountable for imposing unfunded
mandates.
The
Private Property Rights Protection
Act
(HR1944) prohibits states and localities from using eminent
domain to take private property from one private entity and giving it
to another private entity, and allows for sanctions for abuses. It
also prevents eminent domain from being used to target the property of
religious and other non-profit organizations because of their non-profit
status.
Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless
Competition
Act
(HR1123)
allows consumers to unlock cellphones so they can shift to another
providers communications networks.
