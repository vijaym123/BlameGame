Congressman Lamborn Votes to Protect Your
Health Care Plan
9/12/14
This week, Congressman Doug
Lamborn voted for H.R. 3522, the Employee Health Care Protection Act of
2014. This legislation will allow for health care plans carried in the
group market in calendar year 2013 to be continued, without
interference from Obamacare, through calendar year 2018. The legislation passed
the House on a bipartisan vote of 247 to
167.
"Of all the lies told about Obamacare, the most
egregious was the President and many other Democrats saying, 'If you
like your health care plan, you can keep it.' Once Obamacare was fully
implemented, millions of hard-working American families found out that
simply was not the case. This legislation corrects that
misrepresentation and will bring stability to American's insurance plans for the
next four years while we work to once and for all repeal and replace
Obamacare."
