News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
June 9, 2014
Military Prisoner Exchange
Like most Americans, I'm proud of our commitment to return every
American service member home from wars overseas.
However, I do have
serious concerns about how we negotiated the release of Sgt Bowe
Bergdahl.
The Obama Administration struck a deal with the Taliban - we
freed five high-level Taliban leaders from Guantanamo in exchange for
his release.
America has not negotiated with terrorists in the past, and we should
not start now.
Making these kinds of deals on terrorists' terms
empowers extremist groups, and it puts our men and women at greater
risk while serving overseas.
Like many of the constituents who have
reached out to my office on this issue, I'm concerned that this sets a
precedent that we'll negotiate with terrorists in the future.
And I'm
deeply concerned that this Administration has endangered our troops on
the battlefield and Americans at home, for now and for the future.
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon has asked Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel to appear before his Committee later this week to
answer questions about this issue, I look forward to learning more as
Congress investigates the details of this release.
Appropriations Update
As you may know, the House is currently in the thick of appropriations
season.
I gave you a pr
eview of what this would look like
back when we began in
April, and now I want to give you a brief progress report.
In April we
decided on overall spending levels and basic guidelines when we voted
on the FY2015 budget
.
Now we're in the process of
hammering out the details.
While a budget sets the general framework
for our spending, appropriations bills allocate specific funding for
each and every federal program - down to the dollar.
We'll debate
twelve appropriations bills in total, each representing a different
category of federal spending.
As of this evening, we've passed three of the twelve appropriations
bills: Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
, the
Legislative Branch
, and
Commerce, Justice, and Science
.
With
just these three bills, we've already cut almost $2.2 billion from last
year's spending, while still increasing targeted spending for veterans
programs and enhancing law enforcement to prevent cyber-crime and human
trafficking.
This week, we'll debate and vote on two more appropriations bills:
Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development
, and Agriculture, Rural
Development, and Food and Drug Administration
.
I'm
looking forward to appropriating funds to provide for the important
reforms we made in this year's Farm Bill
.
Supporting Small Businesses
As a former small business owner, I know first-hand how bureaucratic
red-tape and harsh regulations can interfere with job creation.
So it's
one of my top priorities in Congress to get the federal government out
of communities' small businesses to let them grow.
I'm honored the
National Retail Federation has recognized my efforts.
They've named me
a "Hero of Main Street
" for my consistent votes to support small
businesses and the U.S. retail industry.
Retail businesses have a
larger impact on our economy than most of us realize - in Texas alone,
retail accounts for 16% of our GDP
and over 3.3
million jobs.
I'll keep voting for small businesses to help Main
Street thrive.

Military
Prisoner
Exchange Like
most
Americans,
I&#8217;m
proud
of
our
commitment
to
return
every
American
service
member
home
from
wars
overseas.
However,
I
do
have
serious
concerns
about
how

the
release
of
Sgt

Bergdahl.
The

&#8211;
we

America
has
not

in
the
past,
and
we
should
not

Making
these
kinds
of
deals
on
terrorists&#8217;
terms
empowers
extremist
groups,
and
it
puts
our
men
and
women
at
greater
risk
while
serving
overseas.
Like
many
of
the

I&#8217;m
concerned
that
this
sets
a
precedent
that
we&#8217;ll
negotiate
with
terrorists
in
the
future.
And
I&#8217;m
deeply
concerned
that
this
Administration
has
endangered
our
troops
on
the
battlefield
and
Americans
at
home,
for
now
and
for
the
future.
House
Armed
Services
Committee
Chairman
Buck
McKeon
has
asked
Defense
Secretary
Chuck
Hagel
to
appear
before
his
Committee
later
this

about
this

I
look

Appropriations
Update
As
you
may
know,
the
House
is
currently
in
the
thick
of
appropriations
season.
I
gave
you
a
pr eview
of
what
this
would
look
like
back
when
we
began
in
April,
and
now
I
want
to
give
you
a
brief
progress
report.
In
April
we
decided
on
overall
spending
levels
and
basic
guidelines
when
we
voted
on
the
FY2015
budget .
Now
we&#8217;re
in
the
process
of
hammering
out
the
details.
While
a
budget
sets
the
general
framework
for
our
spending,
appropriations
bills
allocate
specific
funding
for
each
and
every
federal
program
&#8211;
down
to
the
dollar.
We&#8217;ll
debate
twelve
appropriations
bills
in
total,
each
representing
a
different
category
of
federal
spending.
As
of
this
evening,
we&#8217;ve
passed
three
of
the

bills:
Military
Construction

Veterans

the

I&#8217;m

to

for
the
important

Supporting
Small
Businesses
As
a
former
small
business
owner,
I
know
first-hand
how
bureaucratic
red-tape
and
harsh
regulations
can
interfere
with
job
creation.
So
it&#8217;s
one
of

top
priorities
in
Congress
to
get
the
federal
government
out
of
communities&#8217;
small

grow.
I&#8217;m
honored
the
National
Retail
Federation
has
recognized
my
efforts.
They&#8217;ve
named
me
a
&#8220; Hero
of
Main
Street &#8221;
for
my
consistent
votes
to
support
small
businesses
and
the
U.S.
retail
industry.
Retail
businesses
have
a
larger
impact
on
our
economy
than
most
of
us
realize
&#8211;
in
Texas
alone,
retail
accounts
for
16%

our

over
3.3
million
jobs.
I&#8217;ll
