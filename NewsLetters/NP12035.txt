Rep. Cuellars Office Can Assist Texas District 28 Families Set up Washington D.C. Tours
February 25, 2014
Dear Friends,
I would like to make you aware that can help coordinate tours of government buildings on a year-round for Texas families in the 28 th
District.
The tours offered include:
The U.S. Capitol
White House
Bureau of Engraving and Printing
Library of Congress
Supreme Court
Kennedy Center
Washington D.C. is rich in history and I encourage everyone to explore the center of our Nations government. I find it important to make these services readily available to constituents as visiting the Capitol and other historic buildings is an excellent way to learn about the political history of our great country.
Congressman Cuellar offers tours of several locations including the U.S. Capitol, which are available to Texans of the 28 th
District.
Tours can be easily requested through my website at
http://cuellar.house.gov/
by clicking Tour Request under the Constituents Services tab. A request form can be filled out and sent to the Washington D.C. office electronically.
Please make sure to submit your tour request at least three weeks in advance of the desired tour date.
Requests submitted within three weeks of the date may not be accommodated.
For more information, please visit the website or contact my office at (202) 225-1640.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
