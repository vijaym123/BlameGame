Dear Friend,
This past week, I traveled along Route
71 making over 15 stops in Fairview Park,
North Olmsted, Westlake, North Royalton,
Parma, Green, and Strongsville. Having met
with small business owners, local
officials, and individuals and families
along the way, I can attest that Northeast
Ohio is open for business. However, we can
and should be doing better.
Ohio only gained 600 jobs in March and
more and more people are dropping out of
the labor force or giving up their search
for work all together. The cost of
attending college is skyrocketing, however,
college graduates unemployment rate
is the highest it has been in more than 20
years. Approximately 50 million Americans
live below the poverty line and the
percentage of Americans living in deep
poverty has hit a record over the past
three years. Sadly, many in Washington have
accepted the status quo as the new normal,
but it should not be acceptable to
anyone.
As a former business owner, I can tell
you that red tape and uncertainty created
by Washington bureaucrats makes it
difficult for companies to plan for their
futures. Whether it is the threat of higher
taxes, increased government mandates, or
sorting through the complexities and
devastating unintended consequences of the
Presidents health care law, small
businesses are saddled with
unpredictability
making it
difficult for them to do what they do best:
create jobs.
A recent Wall Street Journal editorial
highlighted the Obama
Administrations seemingly endless
stream of federal regulations citing that
the Federal Register finished 2013 at
79,311 pages, the fourth highest total in
history. According to the Center for
Regulatory Solutions, the regulatory cost
per household totals $14,678 or more than
20 percent of the national average family
income.
In order to incite economic growth, we
need to be doing everything we can to make
it easier for small businesses to succeed.
We in the House of Representatives have
passed countless bills that would roll back
unnecessary federal regulations. This past
February, House Republicans dedicated a
week to Stopping Government
Abuse in an effort to protect
Americans from federal overreach and fight
excessive overregulation. In March, the
Ways &amp; Means Committee Chairman
released a comprehensive discussion draft
for tax reform that will reduce the burden
on our hardworking families and increase
our global competitiveness. I continue to
work with my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to mitigate the harmful effects
of the Presidents health care law.
This week, the House will vote on the
Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification
Act, a bill that would fix a problem
created by the Presidents health
care law and save 1,200 American jobs.
Though our economic recovery is hindered
by this administrations failed
policies and we should be doing much more
to jumpstart our economy, I am encouraged
by the entrepreneurial spirit in
Ohios 16th District. Last week, I
toured the redevelopment site at the
Shoppes at Parma, a project that will
create hundreds of new jobs. I also visited
Vitamix in Strongsville to learn more about
its recent expansion, which created 100 new
jobs. When I met with students and faculty
at Case Western Reserve University, I
visited the ThinkBox, a new
innovation center that provides a space for
anyone to invent. While I was there, I
learned about a recent graduates
invention, the Pebble Smartwatch, and I
went out and bought it the very next
day.
In visiting with local businesses and
students at North Royalton High School this
past week, it could not be clearer that
innovation is alive and well in
Ohios 16th District. However, it is
important that we do better than our
current pace of job creation. I remain
committed to putting forth commonsense,
pro-growth solutions that will reignite the
private sector, renew this struggling
economy, and get Northeast Ohioans back to
work.
Great visit to Moen in North Olmsted.
The city's largest employer is
celebrating its 75th anniversary this
year.
Toured Vita-mix in Strongsville and
learned more about its recent expansion,
which created over 100 jobs.
