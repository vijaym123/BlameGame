Dear Friend,
Just over 50 years ago, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. stood on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial to remind the American people of the
"fierce urgency of now," of the pressing need to address injustice,
inequality, and unfairness immediately. And, while great strides have
been made in that effort, there still remains much work to do. Whether
it's addressing income inequality, education, jobs, infant mortality,
poverty, or the racially disparate impact that mandatory minimum prison
sentences have on our communities, let us never forget that our work is
far from done.
As we celebrate the life of Dr. King, I hope each of us also recommits
to fulfilling the dream he had. While Dr. King's assassination remains
a painful memory for many in Memphis and across the nation, we can each
ensure that his impact on our society does not fade by giving back
through community service. Change cannot be achieved unless we work
together, side-by-side, to help each other. We must do all we can to be
creators, not destroyers. This Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, everyone
can do their part to honor his legacy and help make justice a reality
for all of God's children.
Dr. King once said "injustice in health care is the most shocking and
inhumane" of all the forms of inequality. I will be observing Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s Day of Service by collaborating with Pastor Kenneth
T. Whalum, Jr. and Seedco Mid-South to host an education and volunteer
training event for Memphians to learn more about the Affordable Care
Act and help their communities enroll and take advantage of the law's
many benefits.
I hope you will join me at Pastor Whalum's New Olivet Baptist Church
(3084 Southern Avenue) from 10 a.m. to noon today to get trained as a
volunteer so that you can help make affordable healthcare a reality for
more citizens of the Ninth District.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen

Dear
Friend,
Just
over
50
years
ago,
Reverend
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
Lincoln
Memorial
to
remind
the
American
people
of
the
&#8220;fierce
urgency
of
now,&#8221;
of
the
pressing
need
to
address
injustice,
inequality,
and
unfairness
immediately.
And,
while
great
strides
have
been
made
in
that
effort,
there
still
remains
much
work
to
do.
Whether
it&#8217;s
addressing
income
inequality,
education,
jobs,
infant
mortality,
poverty,
or
the
racially
disparate
impact
that
mandatory
minimum
prison
sentences
have
on
our
communities,
let
us
never
forget
that
our
work
is
far
from
done.
As
we
celebrate
the
life
of
Dr.
King,
I
hope
each
of
us
also
recommits
to
fulfilling
the
dream
he
had.
While
Dr.
King&#8217;s
assassination
remains
a
painful
memory
for
many
in
Memphis
and
across
the
nation,
we
can
each
ensure
that
his
impact
on
our
society
does
not
fade
by
giving
back
through
community
service.
Change
cannot
be
achieved
unless
we
work
together,
side-by-side,
to
help
each
other. We
must
do
all
we
can
to
be
creators,
not
destroyers.
This
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.
Day,
everyone
can
do
their
part
to
honor
his
legacy
and
help
make
justice
a
reality
for
all
of
God&#8217;s
children.
Dr.
King
once
said
"injustice
in
health
care
is
the
most
shocking
and
inhumane"
of
all
the
forms
of
inequality. I
will
be
observing
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.&#8217;s
Day
of
Service
by
collaborating
with
Pastor
Kenneth
T.
Whalum,
Jr.
and
Seedco
Mid-South
to
host
an
education
and
volunteer
training
event
for
Memphians
to
learn
more
about
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
help
their
communities
enroll
and
take
advantage
of
the
law&#8217;s
many
benefits.
I
hope
you
will
join
me
at
Pastor
Whalum&#8217;s
New
Olivet
Baptist
Church
(3084
Southern
Avenue)
from
10

to
get
trained
as
a

so
that
you
can
help
make
affordable
healthcare
a
reality
for
more
citizens
of
the
Ninth
District.
As
always,
I
remain.
