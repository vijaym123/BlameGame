BE PREPARED, NOT SCARED
Do you worry
that you or your family will become the victim of a terrorist
attack?
On a recent trip to Israel, I held the
remains of one of the 15,000 terrorist rockets fired against Israel.

Sadly,
hardworking
Americans are the ultimate target of many terrorists , including
ISIS and al-Qaeda.
Brutal ISIS fighters are known to
possess Western passports, making it easier for them to return to the
United States.
An al-Qaeda affiliate has called for
attacks on U.S. shopping malls.
Just this week, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Iran is seeking to build
both nuclear weapons and Inter-continental ballistic missiles, capable
of striking America.
The news can be frightening,
so what should you do?
Be prepared, but not
scared .
Knowing that Americans are less likely to panic during
a crisis if they have prepared and made plans ahead of time, I've
developed a
Terrorism Preparedness Manual
in
cooperation with qualified experts and military officers, as well as
consulting with FEMA, the CDC, and the American Red Cross.
The
Terrorism Preparedness Manual
includes common sense
suggestions for keeping your home, family, and business safe in the
event of:
Chemical attacks
Biological
warfare
Nuclear attacks, including terror strikes on
nuclear power plants and "dirty bombs"
Explosions and
kinetic attacks
Cyber warfare/hack
attacks
Being prepared will blunt the impact of any terrorist attack, and
make it easier for first-responders to focus on those with the most
critical needs.
The
Preparing Your
Home, Family, and Business for Terrorist Attacks
manual is
available for download at
PrepareNow.com , or by
contacting my Charlotte office at 704-362-1060.
As Americans, we
should never give in to fear, but we should be prepared to protect
our home, family, and businesses.
CNN

Prime Minister Netanyahu prepared to address a Joint Session of Congress,
I joined CNN to discuss the importance of listening to Mr.
Netanyahu's warnings about the threat of a nuclear Iran and ignoring the
unnecessary media hype and political distractions.
