Dear Friend,
A Renewed
Opportunity to Forge a Brighter
Future
It is a great honor to represent Fifth
District Virginians in Congress, and I am
grateful for and humbled by the opportunity
to continue serving you for the next two
years. Tuesdays election
significantly changed the dynamics in
Washington, and with that change comes
renewed opportunities to advance policies
that will address the most pressing issues
facing our country.
As I travel around the Fifth District, I
continue to hear Virginians concerns
about high unemployment rates, the rising
cost of healthcare, the ever-increasing
national debt, and the federal
governments unnecessary regulatory
burdens, all of which stand in the way of
real economic recovery and greater
opportunities for Virginians. They are
frustrated that Washington seems to make
these problems worse rather than work
toward improving things. We in the House
have passed
dozens
of bipartisan jobs proposals
to grow
our economy only to see them be ignored by
the Senate.
But now, we have a tremendous
opportunity to turn these proposals into
real solutions with willing partners in the
Senate. Whether it is reducing the
burdensome impact of regulations that
hamper small business job growth,
mitigating the harmful impacts of the
healthcare law, or eliminating wasteful
spending from federal programs, these ideas
will now receive fair and open debate in
the Senate and have a chance to be signed
into law by the President.
It is my sincere hope that the President
will adhere to his commitment to work
together rather than go it alone and change
our laws through executive action. For
example, his repeated suggestion of the
pursuit of executive action that disregards
our nations immigration laws would
make for bad precedent and bad policy that
would only undermine public confidence that
we can work together to address the great
challenges facing our nation. Rather, we
should pursue the policies to address the
problems that so many Fifth District
Virginians have continually expressed to
me.
Again, I thank you for entrusting me
with the tremendous honor of serving as
your representative in Washington. It is a
privilege to be your voice in Congress, and
I look forward to continuing to fight for a
brighter future for our children and
grandchildren.

On Sunday, Robert spoke at Hampden
Sydney Colleges 16th Annual
Veterans Day Ceremony.
Today, Robert spoke with Chairman Ron
Fischer and American Legion Post 74
Commander Phil Grimm at the American
Legion's Veterans Day Ceremony in
Charlottesville.
As we recognize Veterans Day today, we
remember with gratitude all those brave
service members who throughout American
history, have courageously fought to
preserve our freedoms. Our men and women
in uniform serve selflessly and represent
the best our nation has to offer. Thank
you to all of our veterans, and to our
troops both at home and abroad, who have
given so much to defend our great
nation.
Sincerely,
Washington, DC
