Lee hires new Energy and Natural Resources Legislative
Assistant
Today, Senator Lee announced that he has
hired Chris Prandoni to serve as his new Energy and Natural Resources
Legislative Assistant. Prior to joining Senator Lees staff, starting on
Wednesday, May 6, Prandoni was the Director of Energy and Environment
Policy at Americans for Tax Reform, where he managed their energy
portfolio covering oil and natural gas policy, as well as mining,
electricity generation, and utility interests.
Im
thrilled to have Chris join my staff, Sen. Lee said. His extensive policy
experience with carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, and oil
and natural gas development on federal lands will make him an
invaluable asset to the people of Utah, as he will advise me in my capacity as
a member of the Senates Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
Having worked closely with state legislators and utility companies
around the country, helping them comply with federal regulations, Chris
knows how important local natural resource management is to a land-rich
state like Utah. I look forward to working with him as I continue
fighting in the Senate for legislative solutions that empower Utahns to
manage and control their natural resources according to the needs and
priorities of their
communities.
