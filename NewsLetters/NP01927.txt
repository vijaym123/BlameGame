Protecting
Americans Information on
HealthCare.gov
Dear Friend,
Hearing from those living and working in
Virginias Fifth District has always
been, and continues to be, my greatest
resource as I serve you. Your input has
brought to light problems created by some
of the big government programs coming out
of Washington.
Last year, a constituent contacted our
office to express concern over the fact
that he was unable to delete his profile
from HealthCare.gov. Even though he decided
not to sign up for healthcare coverage
through the federal online marketplace, he
was unable to remove his profile from the
site. When he called the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), he was
told that his personal information simply
could not be removed.
After investigating the issue, we
discovered that others were experiencing
the same problem and that HHS had no
justification for this policy. After HHS
refused to fulfill my request to change
this policy, it became clear that
legislative action would be necessary to
ensure that Americans have the ability to
protect their personal information. That is
why I recently introduced the
Healthcare
Consumer Privacy Act, H.R. 1446 , with
my Democratic colleague, Congressman Collin
Peterson of Minnesota. This bill will
enable individuals to remove their profiles
and personal information from the federal
healthcare website if they decline to
purchase a plan through the site.
This issue is critically important given
all the reports over the past year and a
half regarding
the
security vulnerabilities
of
HealthCare.gov. In July,
HealthCare.gov
was hacked , and HHS did not even
discover the malicious software embedded in
the site for weeks. In September, the
Government
Accountability Office (GAO) released a
study
pointing out that several privacy
and security risks from the sites
launch months earlier had not yet been
fixed. The GAO report expressed concerns
that serious risks of unauthorized access,
disclosure, and modification of all
information collected and maintained by
this website still persist.
To make matters worse, in January,
the
Associated Press
reported that private
companies that specialize in advertising
and analyzing Internet data were obtaining
consumers personal data from
HealthCare.gov. This Administration was so
focused on getting the federal online
marketplace to function at a basic level
that it did not take sufficient action to
ensure that users personal
information will be protected. Given the
outrageous amount of money the
Administration has spent building the
website -
more
than $2 billion according to a Bloomberg
report
- it is astonishing that these
major digital vulnerabilities persist,
jeopardizing the personal information of
millions of Americans.
While I remain focused on repealing the
Presidents healthcare law and
replacing it with real healthcare reform
based upon market-oriented principles, the
Healthcare Consumer Privacy Act is a
critical step in the interim to protect
individuals personal information. It
is my hope this commonsense, bipartisan
bill moves swiftly through the legislative
process. Congress must also remained
focused on its oversight role and continue
pressing the administration to secure
HealthCare.gov. I look forward to working
with Representative Peterson and my
colleagues to ensure that individual
privacy is protected.
