Dear Friend,
80,000: That&rsquo;s how many Californians have enrolled in quality, affordable healthcare through California&rsquo;s health insurance marketplace,
Covered California .
Not one of them? No problem. If you do not already have coverage from your employer, there is still plenty of time and plenty of ways to get covered through Covered California.
One way is to come by an enrollment event, like the one I will attend tomorrow, Saturday, November 22, 2013, at Western High School in Anaheim.
From 2pm to 5pm, Covered California trained experts will give presentations and be on hand to help you sign up through the marketplace.
As always, you can always stop by my office, call me at (714) 621-0102, or visit me at http://lorettasanchez.house.gov/.
Sincerely,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
