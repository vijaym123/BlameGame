Dear Friend,
It's been a little more than a week since the President's health care
law forced many Americans into new health plans that require citizens
to pay for benefits they don't want, don't need, and in some cases
simply cannot afford.
We are still learning of many of the security concerns and the risks
faced by citizens who have provided the government Health Care
Exchanges with personal information that might not be protected. The
House passed legislation this week in an effort to address this issue
of great concern and to put Americans' minds at ease.
The Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act, H.R. 3811, requires
the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department to notify individuals if
their personal information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed
through an ObamaCare exchange. This notification must occur no later
than two business days after discovery by the HHS Secretary.
Congressional oversight has uncovered facts that raise serious concerns
regarding the security of the law's exchanges - due in part to the
failure of HHS to perform a full Security Control Assessment before the
website went live on October 1st.
The Administration has promised to notify individuals of personal
security breaches. This legislation would require it by law!
The Administration has consistently misrepresented the functionality
and readiness of the health law. It is only appropriate to ensure, by
law, that citizens who have been forced to use the ObamaCare exchanges
are at the very least notified if security has been breached.
The health care program is very costly. Our legislation will go a long
way toward ensuring innocent citizens are notified of security breaches
due to the law, and American taxpayers know what they're getting for
their money. It is hard to imagine how anyone could be opposed to such
common sense legislation. I urge the Senate to follow the lead of the
House in requiring transparency and openness for American taxpayers.
On another matter, I recently sent a letter to the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) on the need for more Alzheimer's research. Currently,
over 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Every single
day more than 10,000 baby boomers turn 65. As this great generation
ages, one in eight will develop Alzheimer's. This disease is now the
costliest disease in America, outpacing cancer and heart disease.
Thousands of families across Missouri and the nation are affected by
this terrible disease, and this is one of the reasons I am committed to
this fight. Another reason is the cost to the U.S. taxpayer. The cost
of caring for those with Alzheimer's is expected to cost $20 trillion
over the next 40 years, with
of that money coming from Medicare and
Medicaid.
The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research Care and Services has
called for an increase of funding for Alzheimer's research to at least
$2 billion annually in order to find real solutions and preventions for
this horrible disease. However, the NIH allocated only $503 million on
Alzheimer's research last year. My letter requests that they allocate
additional funding for Alzheimer's research. I also requested an
explanation as to why additional resources are not being put towards
this crisis.
We must do all we can to find a cure for today's families and tomorrow's
seniors. I remain committed to the fight, and I welcome your ideas and
thoughts on this issue.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
It&#8217;s
been
a
little
more
than
a
week
since
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law
forced
many
Americans
into
new
health
plans
that
require
citizens
to
pay
for
benefits
they
don&#8217;t
want,
don&#8217;t
need,
and
in
some
cases
simply
cannot
afford.
We
are
still
learning
of
many
of
the
security
concerns
and
the
risks
faced
by
citizens
who
have
provided
the
government
Health
Care
Exchanges
with
personal
information
that
might
not
be
protected.
The
House
passed
legislation
this
week
in
an
effort
to
address
this
issue
of
great
concern
and
to
put
Americans&#8217;
minds
at
ease.
The
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act ,
H.R.
3811 ,
requires
the
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
Department
to
notify
individuals
if
their
personal
information
has
been
stolen
or
unlawfully
accessed
through
an
ObamaCare
exchange.
This
notification
must
occur
no
later
than
two
business
days
after
discovery
by
the
HHS
Secretary.
Congressional
oversight
has
uncovered
facts
that
raise
serious
concerns
regarding
the
security
of
the
law&#8217;s
exchanges
&#8211;
due
in
part
to
the
failure
of
HHS
to
perform
a
full
Security
Control
Assessment
before
the
website
went
live
on
October
1 st .
The
Administration
has
promised
to
notify
individuals
of
personal
security
breaches.
This
legislation
would
require
it
by
law!
The
Administration
has
consistently
misrepresented
the
functionality
and
readiness
of
the
health
law.
It
is
only
appropriate
to
ensure,
by
law,
that
citizens
who
have
been
forced
to
use
the
ObamaCare
exchanges
are
at
the
very
least
notified
if
security
has
been
breached.
The
health
care
program
is
very
costly.
Our
legislation
will
go
a
long
way
toward
ensuring
innocent
citizens
are
notified
of
security
breaches
due
to
the
law,
and
American
taxpayers
know
what
they&#8217;re
getting
for
their
money.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
how
anyone
could
be
opposed
to
such
common
sense
legislation.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
House
in
requiring
transparency
and
openness
for
American
taxpayers.
On
another
matter,
I
recently
sent
a
letter
to
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
on
the
need
for
more
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research.
Currently,
over
5
million
Americans
suffer
from
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease.
Every
single
day
more
than
10,000
baby
boomers
turn
65.
As
this
great
generation
ages,
one
in
eight
will
develop
Alzheimer&#8217;s.
This
disease
is
now
the
costliest
disease
in
America,
outpacing
cancer
and
heart
disease.
Thousands
of
families
across
Missouri
and
the
nation
are
affected
by
this
terrible
disease,
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
I
am
committed
to
this
fight.
Another
reason
is
the
cost
to
the
U.S.
taxpayer.
The
cost
of
caring
for
those
with
Alzheimer&#8217;s
is
expected
to
cost
$20
trillion
over
the
next
40
years,
with
&#190;
of
that
money
coming
from
Medicare
and
Medicaid.
The
Advisory
Council
on
Alzheimer&#8217;s
Research
Care
and
Services
has
called
for
an
increase
of
funding
for
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research
to
at
least
$2
billion
annually
in
order
to
find
real
solutions
and
preventions
for
this
horrible
disease.
However,
the
NIH
allocated
only
$503
million
on
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research
last
year.
My
letter
requests
that
they
allocate
additional
funding
for
Alzheimer&#8217;s
research.
I
also
requested
an
explanation
as
to
why
additional
resources
are
not
being
put
towards
this
crisis.
We
must
do
all
we
can
to
find
a
cure
for
today&#8217;s
families
and
tomorrow&#8217;s
seniors.
I
remain
committed
to
the
fight,
and
I
welcome
your
ideas
and
thoughts
on
this
issue.
Have
a
great
week.
