VISITING DC
March 13, 2015
Over the last few years, our country has
been the victim of numerous cyber-attacks that have become increasingly
more dangerous. Millions of Americans have had their personal
information stolen. For years, both the business community and our agencies
that keep our country safe have asked Congress for legislation that
addresses these threats. Im pleased to report thatyesterday, the Senate
Intelligence Committee (SSCI) approved the " Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015
(CISA) on a
bipartisan vote of 14-1. This legislation, which I wrote with Vice
Chairman Feinstein (D-CA), is critical to securing our nation against
escalating cyber threats. I'm pleased CISA will advance to the Senate floor
where it will enjoy support from both sides of the aisle. The bill we
passed yesterday is overdue and will enable our agencies and
institutions to share information about cyber threats and to strengthen the
protection of the private information of citizens. With risks are growing
every day, we are finally better prepared to combat cyber attackers
with this bill.

I joined Peter Cook from Bloomberg immediately after
yesterdays committee vote to discuss CISA and its
future.
Chairman Burr on Bloomberg TV:
The
Intelligence Committee understands the threat [cyber attack] presents to
American business, the American economy at the end of the day we've got a
bill that legitimately can go to the Senate floor and hopefully pass
the Senate with fairly significant margin.
Wall Street
Journal had an excellent write-up on my cybersecurity bill in this
mornings paper, read it
here .
Earlier this
week, I joined 52 colleagues in expressing our opposition to a new
proposal from the Administration that would severely limit access to rifle
ammunition primarily used for sporting purposes. You can read the full
text of our letter
here . Within hours of our
letter being sent,
the Obama administration
announced they planned to back down . This is a real victory for the
Second Amendment!

Senator
Cornyns office released this moving video on Tuesday in an effort to
bring more attention to an important piece of legislation, the
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I am proud to join my Senate
colleagues in supporting this legislation
we must do our part to ?end
human trafficking and help protect the most vulnerable. Click below to
watch the video.
Senator Manchin
and I introduced the
Homeless Veterans Prevention
Act of 2015
on Tuesday. It is heartbreaking that we still
have almost 50,000 homeless veterans in this country. This legislation
will help us reduce the number of homeless veterans until all of our
nation's heroes have a place to call home.
In particular, many
women have been unable to fully participate in existing programs because
their children were not allowed to live in the transitional housing.
The Homeless Veterans Prevention Act bill addresses this shortcoming
and increases the availability of housing for homeless veterans. Read
more about our bill to help combat veteran homelessness
here .
Finally, this week we tragically lost 11
service members during a training mission in Florida. This tragedy reminds
us of the great risks our men and women in uniform take every day. We
cannot forget the sacrifices they make on our behalf to defend our
freedom. Our prayers are with their families and we will remember their
service to our great country.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
