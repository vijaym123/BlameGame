Recently, Congressman Doug Lamborn
had the pleasure of
partnering with Debbie Chaves and Colorado Family Action in hosting a small
group discussion on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection
Act.
"This legislation, which passed
the House and that I cosponsored, bans abortions after 20 weeks (five
months) of pregnancy, allows exceptions for when the mother's life is
threatened, or rape or incest occur, and provides compassionate care
for mother and child. The scientific and moral issues
in this case are clear. Babies feel pain at the five month mark and medical
developments are moving up the point of viability. The United States
is one of only seven nations on Earth that allow elective abortions
five months into the pregnancy. As science advances, we are living in an
age of life. Recent polling shows that 60% of the public supports H.R.
35. I have a 100% pro-life record and will continue to be one of the
leading champions and advocates for life in the entire
Congress.
Thank you to Sarah
Zagorski of Colorado Citizens for Life, Mike Norton of Alliance Defending
Freedom, Jessica Haverkate of Colorado Family Action, and all of the
faith leaders and concerned citizens who joined us to discuss this vitally
important issue. The Senate should begin debating the
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the next few weeks. I would
encourage you to personally contact Senators Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner
and strongly urge them to support the bill in the
Senate."
