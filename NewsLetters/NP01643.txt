Happy
Easter:
Meeting with KU Students
About College Savings Plans
Legislation:
This week I spent some time at the University of Kansas chatting with
student leaders about my legislation to expand 529 college savings plans.
We discussed how modernizing and improving 529 college savings plans
- like making computers a qualified expense - are sensible ways to
empower hardworking families and students to save for their college
education.
The
Lawrence Journal World
reported
about a current student using a 529 at KU, Ryan Ott: I have
a 529, Ott said. I probably wouldnt be able to afford all the
student loans to come to KU if I didnt.
The LJ World continued:
Especially with college costs rising, Jenkins said, her legislation
aims to make 529 plans better and more attractive for middle class
families to use.
The students and I also discussed our
efforts to combat sexual assault on college campuses, including
legislation I cosponsored, the Campus Accountability and Safety Act. To read

Mental Health First
Aid:
Mental Health First Aid is a proven education program that helps the
public identify, understand, and respond to the signs of mental
illness. Last week, I sent a letter along with Congresswoman Doris O.
Matsui(D-CA), to the House Appropriations Committee in support of this
program so that we can continue to expand the number of folkswho have the
necessary tools to respond to mental health crises and connect
individuals with mental health resources and services. I will continue to make
mental health a priority as mental illness impacts the lives of
millions of Americans and their families. Too many mental health disorders
continue to go undiagnosed and untreated and we must make prudent
investments to improve mental health awareness in our communities.

Mental Health First Aid in our
communities.
Stops in Cherryvale, Coffeyville, and
Independence:
I had the opportunity to speak with the History class at
Cherryvale High School about my work at home and in DC. The students asked
great questions about the recent budget that Congress just passed and ways
to lower our debt.
In Coffeyville, I had a great meeting with
local leaders about regulations and infrastructure investments.
In
Independence, I spoke with patients, nurses and administrators at the
Independence DaVita Dialysis Center.
We discussed how Congress can
work to better ensure life-saving care to patients in our community.
Thank you for taking the time to tell me about the excellent service you
are providing to those suffering from ESRD.
Upcoming Coffees with Your
Congresswoman:
Next week, I will be hosting a Coffee with
your Congresswoman in Iola and Holton. I hope you can drop by, have a cup
of coffee, and speak with me directly about the issues most important
to them. Listening to Kansans is my top priority and I look forward
to hearing your ideas and bringing them to Washington each and every
week.

ABLE Act Passes KS Legislature:
On
Wednesday, the Kansas legislature approved the establishment of ABLE
accounts in Kansas. The bill now goes to the Governor for his signature. This
will complete the work started in Congress last year on H.R. 647,
which I cosponsored and will allow individuals and families to save funds
to support those with disabilities and help them maintain their
health, independence, and a better quality of life. I spoke on the House
Floor regarding the ABLE Act last December. To watch,
