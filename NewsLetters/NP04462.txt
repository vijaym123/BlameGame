Wicker: Congress Reconvenes With Lengthy
To-Do List
'Lame-Duck' Session Should Focus on
Legislative
Agreement
Unfinished business is likely to control the agenda of the last few
weeks of the 113th Congress, which has entered a work period commonly
known as "lame duck."
The session
which runs between Election Day
and the beginning of the next Congress
is expected to cover a number
of pressing priorities, from funding the government to fighting
terrorism.
I am hopeful
that the final weeks of the year will pave the way for Republicans and
Democrats to work together on real solutions.
For too long,
persistent gridlock and dysfunction under Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid (D-Nev.) have prevented Washington from addressing the challenges
that mean most to Americans.
The public is ready for substantive
legislative action and bipartisan agreement.
Here are a few items
ripe for consideration:
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
As the
nation's major defense bill, NDAA has garnered strong bipartisan support for
the past 52 years.
The legislation provides a blueprint for
America's defense and national security interests, ensuring that our
troops have the resources they need.
Despite being passed by the
House of Representatives and Senate Armed Services Committee in May, it
has yet to come before the full chamber for a vote.
As a
committee member, I sponsored several key provisions to protect and enhance
Mississippi's military installations and defense capabilities.
The fight against ISIS.
Keeping America's armed forces prepared is critical as dangerous
groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seek to advance
a campaign of terror in the Middle East.
In September, Congress
gave the Obama Administration temporary authorization to train and
equip moderate Syrian forces to fight ISIS.
Although suitable as a
first step toward building international support, the President's plan
was inadequate as an overall strategy.
Congress, which is
responsible for authorizing military action, deserves the opportunity to
have a full and robust debate about the Administration's future
objectives.
Keeping the government
open.
In the absence of a budget agreement, Congress has used
continuing resolutions to fund the government on a temporary basis.
On December 11, the current funding is set to expire, prompting
Congress to pass additional legislation or risk a government shutdown.
One option is to approve an omnibus spending bill, which would
fund the government until the end of the 2015 fiscal year.
I am encouraged by Sen. Mitch
McConnell's (R-Ky.) commitment to return the Senate to regular order when he
becomes majority leader next year.
Appropriations bills should go
through the committee process, and lawmakers should be allowed to
offer, debate, and vote on amendments openly.
Looking ahead, I am optimistic about the renewed
focus that a Republican majority in Congress can bring to job creation and
growth.
One area for common ground is trade, which both the
White House and many Republicans support as an avenue for stimulating the
economy.
We saw firsthand how
Mississippi workers benefit from trade when Nissan began production of
its 2015 Murano vehicle in Canton earlier this month.
The auto
plant is now a global hub for exports, connecting Mississippi to more
than 100 markets and giving us a major jobs win at home.
More than
1,000 new jobs were added to support the Murano's production.
Regardless of the legislation
that comes before the "lame-duck" Congress, Americans are looking to
Washington for a commitment that it will put their priorities first.
Lawmakers have an opportunity to change the tone and rebuild
confidence
replacing the partisan tactics of the past with long-overdue
leadership.
