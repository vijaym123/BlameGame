Dear Friends,
Happy Valentines Day!
I hope that you are able to spend
time today with those who mean the most to you.
Although
I spend every day fighting for what I believe will most benefit my
constituents, I felt that today provided a unique opportunity to
highlight those issues on which I believe Congress needs to take
action.
On a national level, these issues include the renewal of
Unemployment Insurance benefits, increasing the minimum wage, equal pay for
women, and immigration reform.
On a more local level, we need to
lower flood insurance premiums and protect our workers from
outsourcing.

I also took part in the USOs Every Moment Counts campaign today,
which allows people to send messages to the troops for Valentines
Day.
If you would like to send your own message of thanks to the
troops, you can do so here:

I am hopeful that the 2014 legislative
session will be one in which all of us in Congress can find ways to work
together in order to protect Americans and address the monumental issues
that face our country.
As always, if there is anything
my office can do to be of assistance to you or your family, please do
not hesitate to contact us at 631-289-6500.
Sincerely,
Congressman Tim Bishop
