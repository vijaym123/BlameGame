Update from Senator Bob Corker
November 29,
2013
I hope you and your family had a happy
Thanksgiving and enjoy a meaningful holiday season.
It is
a tremendous privilege to represent Tennessee in the United States
Senate. Despite our many challenges as a nation, I believe we live in the
greatest country in the world and have much to be thankful for this
holiday season.

Time for Congress to Hold Obama
Administrations Feet to the Fire on Iran
On Fox
News Sunday last weekend, Senator Corker said Congress should hold the
Obama administrations feet to the fire over the interim deal with
Iran to ensure it does not become a final agreement. He also raised
concerns about the interim deal granting tacit approval for Iran to
continue enriching uranium, which violates six U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

Iran has consolidated their
gains and have sanctions relief. I think all of us want to see a
diplomatic solution here. I think its now time for Congress to weigh in
because I think people are very concerned that the interim deal becomes the
norm, and thats why Ive crafted legislation to hold the
administration and the international community's feet to the fire over the next
six months to ensure that this interim deal is not the norm. But look, I
think we all greet it with skepticism, said Corker.
We
see where they state in the preamble, there will be a mutually
defined enrichment program[so] it looks like weve tacitly agreed that they
will be enriching for commercial purposes down the road. So I think
youre going to see on Capitol Hilla bipartisan effort to try to make
sure that this is not the final agreement because people know this
administration isvery long on announcements, but very short on
follow-through.
Last week, Corker introduced legislation to keep
the pressure on Iran during the negotiations and prevent an interim
deal from becoming the final deal.

The German American
Chamber of Commerce of the Southern United States, Inc. (GACC South)
opened their new Tennessee chapter office last Friday in Chattanooga.
The office was dedicated with a ribbon cutting ceremony and remarks from
Senator Corker.
On a recent trip to Munich, I was
able to witness firsthand that the Chattanooga region is on the radar
screen of German industry and investment, said Corker. With the
changing dynamics of American energy prices and the ongoing effort toward
a trade agreement between the U.S and Europe, I believe the potential
for many other opportunities is there, and I welcome GACC South to
Chattanooga.
