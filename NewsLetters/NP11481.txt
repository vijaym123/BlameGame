Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This week, the House of Representatives passed several bills aimed to
rein in the executive overreach of President Obama, including my
Faithful Execution of the Law Act.
Jonathan Turley, a liberal law professor who has testified before the
House Committee on the Judiciary, recently wrote an op-ed
on the President's expansion of executive power. He wrote that, "Obama
is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he has
become the very danger that separation of powers was designed to avoid."
Under our constitutional system, the President does not have the power
to suspend the law. Congress has the exclusive authority to legislate.
If President Obama can suspend some parts of ObamaCare, what would stop
a Republican president from suspending all of it? Allowing the
Executive Branch to enforce only the laws they like sets a dangerous
precedent which nullifies the role of Congress. Please click here
to watch my speech on the House of Representatives
floor on why we need this important legislation.
The Faithful Execution of the Law Act will provide transparency for
Congress and the American people with respect to the suspension of the
law by the executive. Leaking information to the press or burying a
delay in an obscure footnote in some regulatory document is hardly
consistent with being the most transparent administration in history.
Our constitutional system presupposes that laws passed by Congress will
be enforced and it is appropriate to require formal disclosure by the
executive branch when the executive establishes a blanket policy of
non-enforcement.
Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

regarding his Faithful Execution of the Law Act.
On Friday, the House passed a bill, H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and
Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act, which is designed to
institute a long-term solution to the physician payment system under
Medicare.
The uncertainty created by the law in the physician
community threatened to hamper access to care for seniors throughout
Florida and the nation.
By correcting some of the flaws under the
current system, my hope is that this compromise measure will benefit
physicians and seniors alike.
Calling all student artists! I am excited to once again participate in
the Congressional Art Competition.
High school students from all over
the district are encouraged to submit original pieces of art, and the
winning selection will hang in the Capitol for the next year. More
information can be found here
, or by
calling my Washington, DC office at 202-225-2706
.
Finally, please join me this Tuesday, March 18 at 7:00 PM for a town
hall meeting! I will be joining Marc Bernier for the Embry-Riddle
President's Speaker Series in Daytona Beach. This is a live town hall
meeting that will simultaneously be broadcast on 1150 WNDB. Find more
details by clicking here
and
please bring your friends, family, and questions! If you are unable to
attend, watch a live stream at http://newsdaytonabeach.com/

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
several
bills
aimed
to
rein
in
the
executive
overreach
of
President
Obama,
including
my
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act.
Jonathan
Turley,
a
liberal
law
professor
who
has
testified
before
the
House
Committee
on
the
Judiciary,
recently
wrote
an
op-ed
on
the
President&#8217;s
expansion
of
executive
power. He
wrote
that,
&#8220;Obama
is
not
simply
posing
a
danger
to
the
constitutional
system;
he
has
become
the
very
danger
that
separation
of
powers
was
designed
to
avoid.&#8221;
Under
our
constitutional
system,
the
President
does
not
have
the
power
to
suspend
the
law.
Congress
has
the
exclusive
authority
to
legislate.
If
President
Obama
can
suspend
some
parts
of
ObamaCare,
what
would
stop
a
Republican
president
from
suspending
all
of
it?
Allowing
the
Executive
Branch
to
enforce
only
the
laws
they
like
sets
a
dangerous
precedent
which
nullifies
the
role
of
Congress.
Please
click
here
to
watch
my
speech
on
the
House
of
Representatives
floor
on
why
we
need
this
important
legislation.
The
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act
will
provide
transparency
for
Congress
and
the
American
people
with
respect
to
the suspension
of
the
law
by
the
executive.
Leaking
information
to
the
press
or
burying
a
delay
in
an
obscure
footnote
in
some
regulatory
document
is
hardly
consistent
with
being
the
most
transparent
administration
in
history.
Our
constitutional
system
presupposes
that
laws
passed
by
Congress
will
be
enforced
and
it
is
appropriate
to
require
formal
disclosure
by
the
executive
branch
when
the
executive
establishes
a
blanket
policy
of
non-enforcement.
