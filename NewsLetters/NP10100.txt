Dear Friends,
Welcome to my new, weekly e-update, the Benishek Bulletin.
Here you
will find information on issues I am working on that are important to
the people of Northern Michigan.
I came to Washington to fight for
Northern Michigan families, as well as to increase job creation,
improve the economy and fix our broken health care system.
Dr. Benishek Votes to Fund Vital Veterans Programs
On Wednesday, April 30th, I voted to pass H.R. 4486, the Military
Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. This legislation will
ensure our veterans receive the benefits that they deserve.
As a
former VA doctor, I am committed to providing the best available care
for our nation's heroes. Accountability at the VA is long overdue, and
this is a good, common-sense first step in getting there.
Moving
forward, we must demand that those who are failing to do their jobs at
the VA are held responsible for their actions.

Dr. Benishek Denies Bonuses to Senior VA Officials
I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of an
amendment to H.R. 4486, which will deny bonuses to senior VA officials.
Bonuses are paid for a job well done, but at the VA, the job is not
getting done, and it is harming our vets.

Health Care Listening Tour of Michigan's First District
In April, I spent a couple of weeks travelling around the district
meeting with health care professionals, seniors, and veterans in order
to learn about local entities and to discuss my ideas for
patient-centered health care reform and the impact of the Affordable
Care Act in the region.
As a doctor who treated patients for nearly 30
years in Northern Michigan, I understand our health care system and
what it means to take care of patients.
The Affordable Care Act is
substantially changing health care in Northern Michigan, from hospitals
having to lay off employees to cuts in Medicare and Medicare Advantage.
Families, seniors, and hard working employees are feeling the negative
consequences of this law.

I want to hear your thoughts on how best to help the people of Northern
Michigan, so please call me at 202-225-4735 or send me an email through
my website at www.benishek.house.gov

Sincerely,
