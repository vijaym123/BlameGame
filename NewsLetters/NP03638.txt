LEGISLATION
December 28, 2014
Dear
David,
Happy New Year! Much like yourself, as 2015
approaches I have some New Years resolutions, one of which is to reflect
your voice in Congress the best I possibly can. Moving forward into the
114 th
Congress, it is important to me that I understand your
priorities and the policy areas that you care about the most. Please
take a moment to share your thoughts with me below!
As I
wrap up the second year of my first session representing the North
State, I am honored to serve you in Congress during the next session as
well. Below, I included a brief overview that highlights what my staff
and I have been up to this past year, both in Washington and throughout
the North State. Please do not hesitate to contact me if we can be of
assistance in any way. Whether you need help with a federal agency,
would like to purchase a U.S. flag flown over the Capitol, are planning
a visit to Washington DC, or if you are considering applying to U.S.
Service academies, my office is always willing to assist you. For more
information on how we can help, please visit my
