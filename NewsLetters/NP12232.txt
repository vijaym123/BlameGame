About Tim

Dear Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my weekly e-newsletter.
I appreciate the
opportunity to update you on what's going on in Washington and at home
in South Carolina, and as always, welcome your feedback.
Celebrating Our Olympians
We come together to
cheer our Olympians on to victory, and we all feel
a burst of pride in both them and our country when we see them win.
South Carolina was especially glad to send Lauren Cholewinski to the
2014 Winter Olympics as a speed skater. This year our 230 athletes came
from 38 different states, making countless schools, coaches, churches,
trainers, parents and friends extremely proud.
Unfortunately, the tax code works against those who come home
victorious from the Olympic Games by imposing huge tax burdens on the
medals and prizes earned.
I was an original cosponsor on a bill to end
those punitive policies.
You can read more about my efforts here.
Around South Carolina
This past week, I have had the opportunity to travel in South Carolina
to continue my goal of listening to constituents from all across the
state.
I spoke with the congregation at the North Hills Community Church in
Taylors and had lunch with industry leaders in our tourism sector at
the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association in Columbia.
I
shared ideas and information with small business owners and community
leaders over dinner at the Fountain Inn Chamber of Commerce's Annual
Banquet and hosted a roundtable with students, faculty, and school
administration of South Carolina State University.
Throughout, I have
heard inspiring stories of hardworking South Carolinians, and been
honored to represent every one of them.
Speaking at the
Fountain Inn Chamber of Commerce Annual Banquet
I hope you and your families have been safe and warm through the
continuing winter weather.
I am grateful for the opportunity to
represent the citizens of South Carolina in the United States Senate,
and value your thoughts and ideas.
Please don't hesitate to reach out
to my office if we can ever be of service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
