Rep. Candice Miller on Presidents Decision to Keep Troops in Afghanistan until 2016
Washington
Today, U.S. Representative
Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement on the
announcement by President Obama that nearly 10,000 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan until 2016:
&quot;Our troops have been fighting in Afghanistan for nearly 13 years.
Through their great service and enormous sacrifice,
they have made our nation more secure and dealt incredible blows to our terrorist enemies.
Today, President Obama indicated that he has determined that nearly 10,000 members of our military will remain in Afghanistan
after the end of this year.
I believe he has the responsibility to make the case to the American people for this continued involvement in Afghanistan and have his plan authorized through a vote of the peoples representatives in Congress.
If such a vote
were to be brought before Congress today, I would vote against it, because I believe the brave men and women of our armed forces have completed their mission, and it is now time for them to come home.
