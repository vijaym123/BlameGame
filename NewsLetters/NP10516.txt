Dear Friend:
I want to share with you a blog that I wrote about Tax Day.
Today is Tax Day
the deadline for Americans to pay the piper.
For many taxpayers, today brings to mind the same questions year after year.
Where do my tax dollars go?
And, is my hard-earned money being put to good use?
This year, Americans will pay $3 trillion in federal taxes and $1.5 trillion in state taxes.
Thats
30.2 percent of total income and more than all American families spend on food, clothing, and housing combined.
In 2014, it will take exactly 111 days of work for Americans to collectively pay their taxes
thats three more additional days than it took last year.
However, we have seen clearly that raising taxes does not produce a better economy, more jobs, or a higher quality of life for most Americans.
The nations tax burden has become a heavy load on American families, and its time for relief.
Relief can start from reforming our broken tax system.
For most people, tax season comes with feelings of frustration, confusion, and financial stress
partly because Americans are facing rates as high as 44.6 percent due to new taxes in Obamacare, and partly because the tax code is far too complex.
Wonder why its so complicated?
In the past ten years, there have been 4,400 changes to our tax code.
That adds up to more than 1 change per day.
Because of burdensome IRS paperwork, receipt filing, and unnecessary complexities in the law, the American taxpayer spends nearly 13 hours filing his/her personal taxes
that is if they can do it themselves.
Approximately two thirds of Americans and nearly nine out of every ten small business owners hire tax professionals to file their returns.
Every American should be able to understand how the tax code affects his/her personal financial situation without relying on outside experts.
Clearly, it is a broken system in much need of reform.
The American people deserve a fairer, simpler tax code that can be understood and that allows taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money.
For this reason, I am a co-sponsor of the Fair Tax Act, which repeals the income, employment, estate, and gift taxes and instead institutes a national sales tax.
A simpler, fairer tax code with lower and flatter rates will minimize burdens on American families, businesses, and individuals and plant our country on firmer financial footing.
We must never forget that the government is here to serve the people
not the other way around.
