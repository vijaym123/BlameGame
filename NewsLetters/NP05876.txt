David -- Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
Over 1OO,OOO of you contributed to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action.
And when the Republicans piled in $12 million more to defeat us, you stepped up immediately to fight back.
All together, we brought in 176,213 donations to fight Republican attacks. That&rsquo;s just in the last week!
We&rsquo;ve told you before that 99% of donations come from grassroots donors just like you. And 90 cents of every dollar goes directly to supporting Democratic campaigns. But you may still ask:
&ldquo;What exactly are you doing with our donations?&rdquo;
Well, we&rsquo;re glad you asked! Your donations allow us to:
Register
more voters (6O,OOO and counting!)
Reach
voters that might sit out this election (we&rsquo;ve already knocked on over 2 million doors!)
Call out
Republicans&rsquo; shameful record... like blocking the
Violence Against Women Act &hellip; or giving billionaires like the Koch brothers more tax cuts
We just can&rsquo;t thank you enough -- you make our work possible. Now let&rsquo;s go win this election!
All of us at the DCCC!
P.S. We want to send you a free Obama Voter sticker!

(just one more way we&rsquo;d like to say thanks!).
