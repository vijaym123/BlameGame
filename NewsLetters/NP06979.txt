SHOW ME YOUR BUCKEYES PRIDE!
As we gear up for the Buckeyes football kickoff, I can't help but reminisce about what I love most about my alma mater!
Whether its the outstanding educational opportunities, attending football games at The Shoe, walking across the Oval, or the Homecoming Parade
Ohio State is one of the greatest universities in the country.
That is why, Im asking you to send my office your digital photos of your favorite sights and memories on OSU's campus so we can highlight and showcase our Buckeye pride!
All photos can be sent to oh15photos@gmail.com
Please include your name, your city, where the photo was taken and a description of the photo.
By submitting your photo you are confirming your ownership and granting our office permission to distribute your photo on our social media pages and website.
We look forward to sharing your photographs in future newsletters, on our social media pages and with visitors to our offices!
And, if you have any questions, please contact my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-2015.
O-H!
