(April 2, 2015 - Senator Shaheen takes questions at a town hall
meeting in Colebrook, NH)
Dear
Friend,
Wherever I travel and talk with people in New Hampshire, I learn that
hardworking Granite State families share the same aspirations. They want
good-paying jobs, quality schools, affordable healthcare and a clean
environment. Last night, at a town hall meeting in Colebrook, I had the
opportunity to hear from folks from across the North Country about the
issues important to them
issues ranging from the importance of
preserving Social Security, to the urgent need to address New Hampshires
growing heroin and prescription drug abuse
epidemic.
As we all know, there is a great diversity of opinions across our
state, and Granite Staters are not shy about speaking up. And while we may
not agree on every issue, engaging in respectful dialogue and
discussing solutions to the problems we face is how we make progress. I want
to thank everyone who shared their thoughts with me in Colebrook last
night. And to everyone throughout New Hampshire, I look forward to
hearing from you soon.
It is a great privilege and
responsibility to represent the people of New Hampshire in the United States
Senate. I pledge to continue to do everything in my power to support our
families, create jobs and opportunity, and keep New Hampshire the
beautiful state we all love.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
SHAHEEN NAMED RANKING MEMBER OF SMALL
BUSINESS COMMITTEE
Yesterday, it was
announced that Senator Shaheen will serve as the Ranking Member on the
Senate Committee on Small Businesses and Entrepreneurship. From this
position Shaheen can continue to strongly advocate on behalf of small
businesses in New Hampshire and promote policies that will create jobs and
grow the economy.
When I came to the Senate, I asked
to join the Small Business Committee because small businesses are the
backbone of our economy," Shaheen said. "On the Committee, my priority
has been helping small businesses grow by improving their access to
credit, enhancing their ability to reach new markets overseas, and
increasing their contracting opportunities with the federal government. I
am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee to
continue meeting these goals so that we can create jobs and grow our
economy.
SHAHEEN LAUDS
ANNOUNCEMENT OF NORTH COUNTRY CELL SERVICE
PROJECT
Senator Shaheen joined state and local officials in
Whitefield yesterday to announce a project that will expand cell and
broadband service to communities in northern New Hampshire. The project will
utilize WiFi Extender technology that uses existing communication
towers and provides carrier neutral 4G LTE voice and data service and
high-capacity broadband with a much lower infrastructure
investment.
The expansion of cell and broadband service in the North
Country is great news for jobs, the economy and public safety in
northern New Hampshire, Shaheen said. I look forward to continuing to
support this project to increase access to telecommunications services for
North Country residents.
The public-private partnership
will provide service to a much larger area in the North Country by
repurposing a $240,000 Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) grant,
originally appropriated for the building of a single
tower.
