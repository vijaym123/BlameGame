Dear Friend,
This past week, the U.S. Department of
Labor (DOL) released its latest jobs
report, and the news wasnt good.
Though the unemployment rate remained
steady, our economy added far fewer jobs
than expected. Only 126,000 new jobs were
created in March, about half as many as
economists predicted. On top of that, our
labor force participation rate is the
lowest its been in nearly four
decades
meaning more and more
people are dropping out of the workforce or
giving up their search all together.
As I travel around Ohios 16th
District and meet with employers and
employees, I continue to hear that Congress
needs to be doing everything it can to make
it easier for small businesses to succeed
and create the jobs that we need. According
to Gallup, one in four people have wanted
to start a business but decided against it
- and its possible our current
regulatory environment is to blame. As a
former small business owner for nearly 30
years, I know first-hand the challenges
that come with starting a business.
However, the challenges entrepreneurs face
today are much greater than they were three
decades ago. We need to change that.
I believe that we need to reduce
unnecessary regulations that serve as a
barrier to starting a small business.
Instead of stifling growth and innovation,
we need to encourage it. I believe that we
need an energy policy that will strengthen
our energy independence while creating jobs
at the same time. This includes building
the Keystone XL pipeline. I believe that we
need a competitive tax system that
encourages American businesses to stay in
this country, instead of relocate because
of it. This means a comprehensive overhaul
of our burdensome tax code so that it is
simpler, fairer, and flatter. I believe
that Washington doesnt always know
whats best, and that those who make
the rules should have to live by them.
Our small businesses are the backbone of
our economy and central to the vitality of
Ohios 16th District. I remain
committed to doing everything I can to
ensure that our start-ups are successful by
supporting commonsense, bipartisan
solutions that incite growth and allow
Americans to keep more of their hard-earned
paycheck. I look forward to continue
working with my colleagues in the House of
Representatives on both sides of the aisle
toward a real economic recovery in Ohio and
across the country that will move America
forward.
