Holding the VA Accountable for Veterans Care
More than 840,000 veterans call Virginia home and more than 20 million reside in the United
States.
They have served on battlefields across the globe, been stationed at bases both at home and abroad, and spent months, and even years, away
from loved ones.
They have sacrificed greatly to defend the freedoms you and I enjoy each day.
In turn, it is our duty to ensure that they have
access to the care needed when their military service is over.
Recent reports of what can only be characterized as gross mismanagement within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are extremely
alarming. We have heard claims of veterans waiting several months for treatment.
Just a few days ago,
information
surfaced about the deaths of approximately 40 veterans
who were waiting for treatment from a Phoenix VA facility. Ongoing delays of this nature that are denying much-needed care to patients should not
exist within the VA system.
The House of
Representatives is closely monitoring this situation. Our nation&rsquo;s heroes and their families deserve the truth, and the VA must be held
accountable.
Reports have shown that oftentimes VA
senior executives who may have overseen mismanagement were still rewarded with bonuses or positive performance reviews. In order to give the VA more
flexibility to root out the employees who have failed to serve our veterans, I signed on as a cosponsor of
H.R. 4031 , the
VA Management
Accountability Act . Those who have risked it all for our country deserve employees who will give their absolute best. I look forward to
supporting this legislation when it comes before the House for a vote.
If any local veterans have experienced
issues with the VA or need assistance navigating red tape, I urge them to contact one of my Sixth District offices or submit a request by email at
Goodlatte.House.Gov .
