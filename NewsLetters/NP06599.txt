Congressman Lamborn Stands Up to the
EPA
9/9/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted for H.R. 5078 - Waters
of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014. This
bill prohibits the EPA from drastically expanding their power by using
a new rule to expand the current definition of navigable waters. This
rule would would hurt family farms, small businesses, energy
production, commercial development and substantially interfere with
the ability of individual landowners to use their
property. The legislation passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 262 to
152.
"Congress
has consistently recognized the states primary role in regulating and
protecting their streams, ponds, wetlands and other bodies of water. It
is outrageous that the EPA would try expand their a uthority
over waters that are safely and effectively being regulated at the
state and local levels.
Since the Obama Administration
seems to be incapable of reigning in their out of control bureaucrats, the
House will step in and fill that
void."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
