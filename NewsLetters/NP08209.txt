Su Jeong Christina Kim is the 2014 Congressional Art Competition winner from the Northern Mariana Islands. Christina, a sophomore at Marianas High School, and her chaperone, MHS Vice Principal Hazel Tudela, flew to Washington this week for the official festivities and to see Christinas work on display at the U.S. Capitol. Students from each of the 441 congressional districts compete to represent their home. A panel of local Marianas artists selected Christinas painting of a beautiful island sunset from over twenty entries. Congratulations, Christina!
Kiaaina confirmed as Insular Assistant Secretary
Congratulations to Ms. Esther Puekela Kiaaina on her confirmation by the U.S. Senate this week to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Insular Areas. Ms. Kiaaina was nominated for the position by President Barack Obama in September and renominated on January 6 at the beginning of the second session of the 113th Congress. The office she will be heading plays a vital role in helping the Northern Mariana Islands and the other U.S. insular areas develop our economies, build public infrastructure, and nurture our human resources. Assistant Secretary Kiaaina will bring a new sense of urgency and direction to those efforts. Ms. Kiaaina and I have known each other since the 1980s, when we worked together for Hawaii Senator Daniel K. Inouye. I look forward to working together again, she as Assistant Secretary and I as Ranking Member on the House subcommittee responsible for insular affairs, for the benefit of Americas island jurisdictions.

Job training to get 17 percent boost
After months of negotiation between the House and Senate, a job training bill with a 17 percent increase in funding is on the move. The Senate passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act on Tuesday, 95-3; and the bill now goes to the House, where approval is expected. H.R. 803 is effectively a 6-year reauthorization of the familiar Workforce Investment Act, or WIA, with important modifications. In addition to the funding increase, the bill gives local Workforce Investment Boards more flexibility to use the money to meet local needs and ensure that individuals are trained for the jobs that exist in their communities. These federal funds are important to the Northern Marianas as our economy transitions to rely less on foreign workers and more on trained U.S. workers.

Ms. Amy Tighe (second from left), daughter of the late Ruth Tighe of Tanapag, and representatives of the Citizens Climate Lobby briefed your congressional staff this week on the organizations proposal to reduce the carbon emissions that are causing global warming. Our islands are particularly at risk as sea levels rise, weather patterns change, and ocean acidification kills the corals surrounding us. CCL wants to tax carbon-emitting fuels and rebate 100 percent of the money to households.
Free public tour of NOAA research ship
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is inviting the public to an open house on the R/V Oscar Elton Sette , on Saturday, July 5, from 12 to 4 p.m. at the Port of Saipan. The vessel is engaged in a 30-day research project
in the waters of the Northern Mariana Islands to learn more about the biology and environment of bottomfish resources that support the local fishing economy. On the first leg of its voyage, from June 19 to July 3, scientists on the Sette are studying the near shore and coastal waters of Uracas, Maug, and Asuncion, the Islands Unit of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. During the second leg of the expedition, July 7 through 21, research will focus on the waters of Pagan, Guguan, Sarigan, and Anatahan. Local fishermen and representatives of Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality, Division of Fish and Wildlife, Northern Marianas College, and the Northern Mariana Islands Mayors Office are travelling aboard the Sette, which will also be dropping an archeological team on Alamagan for field studies there.

AAFES troop store expansion moves forward
The 5,000 square foot expansion of the troop store on Saipan is now scheduled for completion by the end of 2015, according to officials of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, which runs the store. I requested study of the expansion in 2011 and completion was originally planned for 2013, but the possibility of unexploded ordnance at the site has caused delay. The existing store, which serves about 4,000 active and reserve service members, retirees, and their families, is small, deteriorating, and in need of a major overhaul. Early last year, however, the U.S. Navy, which controls the property, required that an Explosive Safety Survey be completed before construction can begin. The Armys 9th Mission Support Command recently transferred the necessary funds for the survey to the Navy and the go-ahead on the project is expected by the end of July. Clearance of any ordnance could then occur in September and October, and construction could begin in November. The store expansion is expected to take twelve months to complete. Grand opening is scheduled for December 2015.

Welcome to Crystal C. Lunag Borja, summer intern at the Tinian congressional district office. Ms. Borja is 19 years old and currently attends the University of Guam. She is working on a degree in accounting and upon completion plans to return to the Northern Mariana Islands to be an accountant. We always look forward to a summer filled with student interns. They bring us youthful energy and enthusiasm; and in return, we hope, we expand their base of experience.
