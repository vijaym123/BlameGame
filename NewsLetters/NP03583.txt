Week in Review
As
the 114
th
Congress begins, I
look forward to serving the
Senates majority. This will
be a breath of much-needed
fresh air in Washington. Under the
new leadership, the Senate will
focus on job creation, the economy,
and working to help the American
people.
My
focus will remain to serve the
people of Nevada and act as your
primary voice on Capitol Hill by
using my committee assignments and
new legislation as a means to
further the interests of
Nevadans.
Having a seat on both the Senate
Finance Committee and the Special
Committee on Aging will allow me to
strengthen and protect important
programs to Nevadans like Medicare
and Social Security. As the Senate
seeks to pass transportation
legislation in the new Congress, my
seat on the Commerce, Science,
&amp; Transportation Committee will
ensure top priorities for Nevada,
such as Interstate 11, do not go
unnoticed. As Nevadans recover from
one of the worst housing market
crashes in history, I remain
committed to protecting your
interests as a member of the
Banking, Housing, &amp; Urban
Affairs Committee. With nearly
300,000 veterans living in the
state, I will continue to fight for
the rights of veterans to receive
proper medical care and treatment
while serving on the
Veterans Affairs Committee.

In
this first week of the new
Congress, I reintroduced
No
Budget, No Pay ,
requiring members of Congress to
pass a budget and all
appropriations bills in order to
receive pay. When Nevadans are
trying to make the most and best
use of their hard-earned dollars,
Washington needs to do the same by
taking responsibility to pass a
basic budget.
I
am also pleased with the passage of
the
Terrorism
Risk Insurance Act (TRIA)
program in both the House and the
Senate in this last week. As a
co-author of legislation
reauthorizing TRIA, I recognize the
benefits for future commercial
development in bringing a stable
and reliable support system for
industries in our state in the
event of a terrorist attack. This
program provides a crucial
safeguard ensuring Nevadas
prosperity.
In
the 114
th
Congress, I
will continue working hard to
better our state and our
country.
