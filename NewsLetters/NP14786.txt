Dear
Friend:
Thank you for taking the time to read my
e-newsletter.
Today, Id like to provide information on a program newly available
at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport and many other
airports that is designed to speed up the security screening process
and help alleviate the worry that comes when you feel rushed to make a
flight.
THE TSA PRE-CHECK
PROGRAM
A long security line at the airport can cause frustration and
anxiety.
The idea behind the
"Pre-Check"
expedited screening program being instituted by the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA)
is to speed up the security process while
protecting everyone's safety.
WHERE IS IT
AVAILABLE?
The TSA pre-check program is being offered
at a number of airports, including the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth
International Airport.
Several carriers are participating and
others are preparing to take part.
You can view a list of
participating airports and airlines
here.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?
If you are
approved for expedited screening, the information will be embedded into
the barcode of your boarding pass.
This will allow you to
use the TSA pre-check lane at security checkpoints.
Aside
from benefit of using this dedicated lane, you may be exempted
from the standard precautions of taking off your shoes, jacket, and belt
and removing your laptop from its case.
Parents who have
qualified for the program can bring children 12 and younger into the
lane with them. This expedited procedure is available for domestic
and international flights.
HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I
AM ELIGIBLE?
The TSA pre-check program is
currently available to randomly selected passengers, frequent flyers, and
members of trusted traveler programs like Global Entry, but that will be
changing.
In the coming months, TSA will begin a program to
allow passengers to enroll in its own trusted traveler program, which
will allow for domestic access to expedited screening.
In the
meantime, interested passengers can become eligible by enrolling in one of
the Custom and Border Protection's (CBP) programs.
There is a
fee involved, but the status is good for five years and also provides
expedited customs screening. More information is available from the
TSAs
How to Participate
webpage and the
CBPs
Trusted Traveler
webpage.
CHECK IT OUT
You might
consider "checking out" the TSA pre-check program.
If you miss one
flight due to a delay getting to your gate and have to rebook at a
higher cost, it could be well worth your while.
As 9/11 reminded
us, safety must be the top priority at our airports but consideration
must always be given to improving the screening process and treating
every passenger with courtesy and
respect.
