Dear Friend,
I was shocked when I heard that the Koch brothers&rsquo; network was more than doubling the amount of money it plans to spend on this year&rsquo;s elections.
And then I dug a little deeper, and it became clear --
the Big Oil Koch brothers are upping the ante because they know that real action on climate change will hurt their bottom line.
So they&rsquo;re trying to buy a Senate to block any action to stop our long, dirty power plant era.
The Koch brothers are willing to put their own profits ahead of the public and the planetary good. Well, we&rsquo;re not -- and we&rsquo;re not going to let them buy this election, either. With just 7 days remaining until the FEC deadline, we need to raise $36,000 to stay on track for victory. Can you chip in $5 to get us closer to our goal?

Or donate another amount.
Truth be told, every Democrat should be worried about the Kochs&rsquo; spending spree -- particularly Democrats like me, who&rsquo;ve been leading the charge on climate change.
The Koch brothers haven&rsquo;t said where their hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent this year, but campaigns like ours need to be ready for anything. Please, if you&rsquo;re able, give $5 to help us reach our $36,000 goal before the FEC filing deadline.
Progressives can beat back this barrage from the Koch brothers -- but only if we stand together. And I want to thank you for continuing to stand with me.
Sincerely,
Ed
