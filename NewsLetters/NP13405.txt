David, here&rsquo;s three reasons we&rsquo;re emailing you on New Year&rsquo;s Eve:
Cheri&rsquo;s opponent, Tea Party ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling, recently said he was going to raise $2 MILLION for next year&rsquo;s election.
After tonight we have to report our fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission.
According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t made an
online donation
to Cheri&rsquo;s campaign in 2013.
We can&rsquo;t afford to get out-raised by Bobby Schilling -- not if we want Cheri to keep fighting for Illinois.
But, right now, we&rsquo;re still 41 donations short of our grassroots goal.
