Unconstitutional Surveillance
On
Wednesday, I voted against the
USA Freedom Act , which the House of Representatives passed
by a vote of 338-88.
Click here to read the
Topeka Capital-Journal 's coverage of last week's
vote.
Wednesday's vote undid the progress
made by the Second Circuit's ruling on the NSAs bulk collection of our
phone records by reauthorizing the program. Protecting every American
from the threat of terrorism is the utmost responsibility of the
federal government, but we cannot simply discard the civil liberties
enshrined in our Bill of Rights.
My
preference would have been to advance a version of the USA Freedom Act that
not only ensures the protection of our national security, but also
includes essential reforms to our governments surveillance of its own
citizens. While the bill that passed has improvements over the status quo,
it leaves glaring loopholes that allow the government to abuse the
privacy rights of innocent Americans.

watch a YouTube video of Congressman Yoder's testimony before the Rules
Committee.
One such loophole is outdated federal
law that allows government agencies to search Americans digital
communications without probable cause if they simply wait 180 days. Allowing
the consideration of my
Email Privacy Act
as an amendment to the legislation passed
last week would have done away with this loophole and significantly
strengthened the overall
bill.
Unfortunately, while many members of the Rules Committee vocally support this
commonsense update, the committee ruled my amendment out of order and
it was not allowed consideration on the House floor. While Im
disappointed, I will continue to fight for the privacy rights of American
citizens. I will work with Chairman Goodlatte and House Leadership to
pursue every legislative avenue to pass the Email Privacy Act before the
end of this session.
Fighting for Life
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed the
Pain Capable Unborn Child
Act
by a vote of 242-184, with my
support.
Substantial medical evidence has shown that unborn children are capable of
feeling pain five months into a pregnancy. Additionally, a recent
study showed that nearly one-fourth of infants born at five months
survive after they are given medical treatment. Sadly, many children at the
same stage of development or later are not allowed a chance at a full
life. The Pain Capable Unborn Child Act puts a stop to this barbaric
practice
not unlike what was uncovered at Dr. Kermit Gosnells clinic
in Philadelphia two years
ago.
Passing this bill was not only morally the right thing to do, but it is
also supported by a significant majority of the American people. As of
2013, 64% of Americans indicated support for this particular bill and
80% of Americans indicated opposition to third-trimester
abortions.
As the 114th Congress continues, I look
forward to working with my colleagues to protect the sanctity of life
wherever possible.
Congressional Oversight on Iran
Nuclear Deal
On Thursday, I voted for
the
Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act , which prevents the president from unilaterally
lifting sanctions on Iran if Congress votes to disapprove a final
nuclear deal with Iran.
This bipartisan legislation
reasserts Congress constitutional role in overseeing the
Administrations nuclear deal with Iran. The founders smartly vested the authority
to approve foreign treaties with the legislature in order to reflect
the will of the American people. This power is especially important to
reinforce with an Administration that has been so fond of acting
unilaterally.
I cannot support a deal that will lift
sanctions without stopping Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has
a history of lying to other nations, stonewalling international
inspectors when it comes to its nuclear program, and funneling money to
terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. This bill will allow Congress to
reject any deal that does not provide for a safer and more secure
Middle East, and reduce the threat posed to Israel and the United
States.
The House also took action against Hezbollah by
passing the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act by a vote
of 423-0, with my support. The bill imposes sanctions on any foreign
entities that facilitate financial transactions on behalf of Hezbollah
or its affiliates.
Celebrating Armed Forces Day by
Supporting the Troops
Last Friday was National
Armed Forces Day, which the House of Representatives celebrated by
passing the
National Defense
Authorization Act
- the bipartisan bill that fulfills
Congress' clear constitutional responsibility to protect our national
security.
Importantly, this year's bill raises military pay by
about 2.3 percent - a full percent higher than the President's Budget
Request of 1.3 percent - to ensure that we are keeping our promise to
those who defend our freedoms every day.
Additionally,
the bill:
Funds our national defense at the exact
level the president requested.
Provides for acquisition
reform that will save taxpayers money.
Keeps terrorist
detainees out of the United States.
Reinforces the mission
to defeat ISIL.
Provides lethal aid to
Ukraine.
Strengthens our cyber defenses.
Increases our missile
defense capabilities.

National Police Week
Last
week was National Police Week concluding with Peace Officers Memorial
Day. In Overland Park, flags were flown at half-staff on Friday to honor
the men and women who have lost lives or have been disabled while
serving as police officers.
One of those
honored on Peace Officers Memorial Day was Deanna Rose - the only
Overland Park police officer killed in the line of duty and the first
female officer killed in Kansas. Thank you to all first police and their
families for their service and sacrifice to our communities.

2015 Congressional Art
Competition
Click here to read Congressman Yoder's post on
Medium about the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.
Each spring, a nation-wide high school arts competition is
sponsored by the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The
Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to recognize and encourage
the artistic talent in our nation, as well as in the Third
Congressional District in Kansas.
De Soto High School senior Lance Erickson explaining his
piece "Lake Tahoe" to Congressman Yoder.
Beginning in 1982, the competition has provided an opportunity to over
650,000 high school students to put their artistic talents on display. It
is open to all high school students in each Congressional District,
with the overall winner of each districts competition displayed for one
year in the United States Capitol.
Congratulations to Jennifer Fu of Blue Valley North for winning this
years competition. Her outstanding entry was chosen from many
fantastic pieces of art this year, and I look forward to walking by
Jennifers art every day in our nations capital. The Third District boasts
some of the most talented young artists across Kansas, so being chosen
as the competitions overall winner is a great
honor.
Kansas Association of Realtors
Thanks to
members of the Kansas Association of Realtors for visiting my office in
Washington, DC. It was great to sit down and discuss important issues
facing the real estate market in our country, and what the House of
Representatives will be doing to address them going forward in the 114th
Congress.
Eisenhower Excellence in Public Service Series
It is always great to get a visit from the women of
the Eisenhower Excellence in Public Service Series at my office in

visit.
Fact of the Week
It was 50 years ago today - on May 18, 1965 - when
President Lyndon B Johnson announced Project Head Start from the White
House Rose Garden.
I've been a proud
supporter of Head Start throughout my career, and was one of two House
Republicans to receive the National Head Start Association's PROMISE
Award earlier this year.
