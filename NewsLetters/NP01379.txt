David --
Just weeks after House Republicans voted to voucherize Medicare, Boehner is negotiating with Senate Republicans on the final GOP budget. If Boehner has his way, Medicare could be DESTROYED as we know it.
David -- that&rsquo;s not right. Our seniors have worked hard their entire lives, and they deserve the benefits they&rsquo;ve been promised.
SIGN THE PETITION: Tell Boehner and McConnell not to put Medicare in jeopardy &gt;&gt;
Cheri went to Congress to protect Illinois&rsquo; 1.9 millions seniors who rely on Medicare. She won&rsquo;t let their essential benefits become pawns in Boehner&rsquo;s political games.
There is still time to save Medicare -- but we need to make sure Boehner and McConnell know where we stand. ADD YOUR NAME:
