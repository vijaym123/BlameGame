Blaine's Bulletin
Whatever your political persuasion, I think most Americans would agree that its important to have a voice in our government and that is why voting is such an important part of being an American.
Our form of democratic government has served as a model for the world for more than two centuries. So many American lives have been lost protecting our freedoms, including the right to vote without fear or malice.
The American experience at the ballot box has developed over the centuries. It has become more inclusive and more accessible and continues to be the envy of the world. And as we prepare to vote in the general election, it is important to remember how we got to this point in the electoral process.
When the U.S. Constitution was ratified, only white male property owners age 21 and older were guaranteed the right to vote and by 1843, a series of acts expanded voting requirements so that all white men 21 and older could cast a ballot. In the aftermath of the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, the 15 th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to vote to all men 21 or older regardless of race or ethnic background. Through the tireless efforts of the Suffrage Movement, the 19 th
Amendment to the U.S Constitution gave women age 21 and older the right to vote in the early 20 th
Century.
But there was certainly more to do when it came to American voting rights and some major changes occurred in the 1960s, when our country made monumental reforms to our election system that ensured fairness for all. The 24 th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1964 made it illegal for states to charge poll tax to voters, and one year later the Voting Rights Act authorized the federal government to take over registration of voters in areas where state officials had regularly prevented African Americans and other minorities from registering to vote or cast their ballots through usage of literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and intimidation tactics.
In 1971, the year I turned 19 years old, the 26 th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution lowered the voting age across the nation to 18 and in 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act extended voting guarantees provided by the Voting Rights Act to include specific voting provisions for those Americans with disabilities, voters who were not able to read and write and citizens not fluent in English.
Our nation has grown tremendously over the years when it comes to voting and at the end of the day; our nation has an election system that encourages participation in the election process for all Americans. I know we all agree that having a voice in our government is important and its just one reason why it is so special to be an American.
