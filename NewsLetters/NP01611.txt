Tour with VA Secretary McDonald
Dear David,
This week I had the honor of traveling across Montana with Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald.
We covered a lot of ground in two days. We met with veterans, VA employees, students, and medical professionals.
It was a productive trip, and I was able to show the Secretary some of veterans' most pressing needs in Montana
We heard about the challenges that the VA faces in recruiting doctors and nurses, and how it directly impacts the care that vets receive.
This lack of staffing led to the closure of the mental health facility at Fort Harrison and now VA Montana is trying to find ways to reopen it.
We saw the crowded VA clinic in Missoula, where veterans' privacy suffers when they walk in the door, and doctors barely have enough room to treat patients.
We met with students and faculty at the University of Montana's physical therapy and pharmacology programs and we encouraged the students to come work at the VA, because there is nothing more noble than helping our nation's veterans.
We also saw the cutting edge research being done on campus at the Neural Injury Center.
I hope that this research will be used to help address the unseen wounds of war.
In Billings, we listened to veterans who shared their stories of long wait times, and a need for improved mental health treatment and womens' health care. And we discussed ways that the VA can communicate and coordinate with local providers to better serve patients.
The Secretary listened carefully and promised improvements.
Now, as we move forward, you have my commitment to follow up and hold the VA accountable so that it delivers on the promises we made to the brave men and women who served our nation.
Keep in touch,
