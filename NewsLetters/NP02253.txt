Dear Friend,
While most of the headlines
coming out of Washington lately have been focused on gridlock and
dysfunction, I still believe there is common ground to be had.
I am
willing to work with anyone
Democrat or Republican
who has a good
idea.
Below are some of the ways Ive been working on behalf of
hardworking families in western and central Wisconsin over the past
month.
Saving for
College
As
the representative of 14 colleges and universities across western and
central Wisconsin, I know that higher education is a top
priority.
With rising tuition costs and the growing crisis of student loan
debt, we need to take concrete steps now to protect higher
education.
I recently introduced
bipartisan legislation that would expand, modernize, and strengthen
tax-free 529 college savings plans to help more Americans save for their
childrens education.
My bill, H.R. 529, improves 529 savings plans
by empowering students to use their savings for computers, eliminates
an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule, and allows taxpayers to
re-deposit refunds from colleges without taxes or
penalties.
Rail
Safety
As more and more oil
is being shipped across Wisconsin, the risk of derailments and spills
in our communities continues to grow.
Just last week, we saw
another train derailment less than 15 miles from the Wisconsin-Illinois
border.
Thats why I
introduced the Railroad Emergency Services Preparedness, Operational
Needs, and Safety Evaluation (RESPONSE) Act, to help first responders in
local communities in the event of a train derailment or fuel
spill.
To learn more about the RESPONSE Act, watch the video
below:
Promoting Healthy
Choices
Sixty-nine
percent of American adults and seventeen percent of children and adolescents
are overweight or obese.
As public health experts agree, a more
physically fit population would lower health care costs, reduce
government spending, result in fewer illnesses and improve worker
productivity.
In order to encourage
physical fitness and a healthy lifestyle, I teamed up with my colleague
Rep. Charles Boustany (R-LA) to introduce the Personal Health Investment
Today (PHIT) Act.
This bipartisan legislation allows employees
to use pre-tax benefits to help cover the cost of an expanded number of
preventative fitness expenditures.
Sincerely,
DISTRICT OFFICES
