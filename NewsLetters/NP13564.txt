Dear
Friends,
The Ryan-Murray budget agreement, which
passed the House overwhelmingly on Thursday, is a small step in the right
direction.
For the first
time in years, we are reducing the deficit by addressing mandatory
spending, the real driver of our debt crisis, and doing so without
raising taxes. Reforms such as requiring federal employees to contribute
more to their own retirement will save taxpayer dollars billions of
dollars.
While I would have
preferred bigger reforms, the Democrats who control the Senate and
White House would not go along without another huge, job-killing tax
increase.
Our economy,
while improving, is still underperforming. The uncertainty caused by
Washington lurching from one crisis to another has contributed to the
problem by shattering the public's confidence in Washington's ability to
govern. When the private sector does not know what to expect from
Washington, it is much more reluctant to take risks, invest in new
ventures, and hire more people.
Setting a budget for the next two years will help alleviate some of
this uncertainty and allow Congress to focus on jobs, economic
growth, and the fight against Obamacare.
Stay in touch and God
bless,
