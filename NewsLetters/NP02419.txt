David -- In the first few weeks of the new Republican Congress, the GOP has attacked Social Security. They&rsquo;ve attacked health care. They&rsquo;ve attacked the rules on Wall Street. They even threatened a reckless shutdown of our national security funding.
And here&rsquo;s the worst part: The Republicans aren&rsquo;t even ashamed of it. The lawyers and lobbyists are strutting through the Capitol halls like they own the place. With Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers, and all the powerful interests in their corner, they&rsquo;re betting they can get away with it.
There&rsquo;s only one thing we can do: Fight back with everything we&rsquo;ve got.
The DSCC is fighting to hold extreme Republicans accountable and to take back the Democratic majority in the Senate in 2016. But it won&rsquo;t happen without all of us coming together.
That means we need you.
The end-of-month fundraising deadline is midnight, and we still need 3,000 Democrats to donate to the DSCC to hit our goal.
Will you be one of them? Donate to the DSCC by midnight tonight to take back the Senate.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
If you thought the money the Republicans spent last year to take over the Senate was obscene, fasten your seatbelts for what&rsquo;s in store. The Koch brothers alone have pledged to spend $889 million in the 2016 elections to push their agenda and elect even more GOP extremists.
The only way we&rsquo;ll defeat them is if Democrats get organized and really come together.
I know it can be done -- because we did it in Massachusetts in 2012.
The question is whether enough Democrats will stand up -- stand up to corporate money and powerful interests and stand up for regular people, working families, and progressive values.
I&rsquo;m in
--
what about you? Will you donate by midnight to take back the Senate?
Thanks so much for your help,
