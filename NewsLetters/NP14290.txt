Benghazi Investigation Update
Wednesday, November 13, 2013
Dear Friend,
You may think that the House of Representatives has dropped the investigation into what transpired in the September 11, 2012 attack in Benghazi, but if so, you are mistaken.
This important investigation is ongoing, and can be tracked at the website below.

I hope you will find this to be a valuable resource.
As always, if you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.

Sincerely,
H. Morgan Griffith
Member of Congress
