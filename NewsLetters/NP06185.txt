Dear Friend,
Two big oil billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to influence this year&rsquo;s elections.
Charles and David Koch are the living symbols of the damage
Citizens United
has wrought, and today, we&rsquo;re standing up to them.
The Koch brothers&rsquo; network of outside groups is financing an all-out ad blitz across the country. They&rsquo;re responsible for more than 10% of all the ads in this year&rsquo;s Senate races -- and it&rsquo;s time we told them enough is enough. Join me and say no to Koch-fueled elections.
It&rsquo;s not just that the Koch brothers support an agenda that lines their own pockets at the expense of middle class families -- it&rsquo;s also that they&rsquo;re trying to use their exorbitant personal wealth to dictate the terms of the national debate.
They&rsquo;ve spent hundreds of millions denying climate change. They broke records for outside spending in the 2012 presidential election. And this year, they&rsquo;re trying to buy the Senate. It&rsquo;s up to us to stop them. My colleagues and I are joining together to speak out against the Koch brothers, and we&rsquo;d appreciate your support. Add your name to mine and help us stop the Koch brothers.
Thank you for your support.
