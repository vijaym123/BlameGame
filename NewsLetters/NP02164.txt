A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER
The open enrollment period for 2015 health
coverage has ended, and Im pleased that more than 289,000 Marylanders
signed up for a plan through the Maryland Health Connection, including
more than 84,000 in the Fifth District.
Im also pleased that according to a new Gallup Poll
released last month, Marylands uninsured rate
dropped
from 12.9%
in 2013 to 7.8%
in
2014. As a result, Maryland is
ranked 9th among states for the largest reduction in the number
of people who are uninsured.
I also want to
share with you that a special enrollment period
for 2015 coverage began yesterday through
the Maryland Health
Connection. This enrollment period is for Marylanders who owe a tax penalty
for not having health coverage in 2014 and became aware of the penalty
after the 2015 open enrollment period ended on February 15. These
consumers have from now until April 30 to enroll in coverage for the
remainder of 2015. Click
here
t o enroll
and find out additional
information.
Its clear that
the Affordable Care Act is working to expand
Maryland families access to quality and affordable
health
coverage. In Congress, I will continue to
oppose
efforts to undermine or repeal the protections
provided by this critical law.
As always, thank you for
allowing me to share this update with you, and please continue to share your
concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting
with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter , or
YouTube .
With warmest regards, I am
Sincerely
yours,
Steny H. Hoyer
