Rep. Miller on Construction of the
New Port Huron Welcome Center
Washington
&#8211;U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement on the construction of the new $5.5 million Port Huron welcome center to begin this week:
&#8220;Serving as the gateway for travelers entering into the U.S. and the great state of Michigan via the Blue Water Bridge, the new welcome center in Port Huron will improve the experience for travelers and boost the local economy.
&#8220;I applaud the Michigan Department of Transportation for their leadership with this important project, and I especially commend them for taking the time to reach out to the residents and local businesses in Port Huron throughout
the planning process.
Incorporating suggestions and input from the Port Huron community will help ensure the success of the new center.&#8221;
