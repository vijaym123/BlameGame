Dear
Friends,
The freedoms we enjoy today are only possible
because of the brave men and women of our Armed Forces.
As we
celebrate Veterans Day on Tuesday, I hope you will join me in saying thank
you to those who serve or have served.
Our obligation to our troops does not end when a war is over,
and we must ensure that our military men and women are provided with the
care they deserve both during and after service. As your
Representative in Congress, I will continue to fight for the rights and benefits
of our veterans, and hold strong the commitments made for those career
military families who have sacrificed so much to defend this great
nation.

Day.
