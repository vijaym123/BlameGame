Aloha friends,
As we continue to monitor the situation on the Big Island, I had an opportunity to speak on the House floor to remind my colleagues of the latest threat to our residents. The same area that bore the brunt of Hurricane Iselle now faces the prospect of serious, long-lasting damage from the approaching lava flow. We will again look to those who provide life-saving assistance in these devastating challenges.
I asked them to remember Hawaii when the time comes to fund Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Agriculture, our first responders, and all those who bring relief to those facing the devastation.

On September 18, during a House Armed Services Committee hearing, I questioned U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Director of Operations Lieutenant General William Mayville Jr.
on the Obama Administration's strategy to weaken and combat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

This past weekend, I had the honor of participating in the 68th Annual Aloha Festivals Floral Parade. The Aloha Festivals attract both locals and visitors, and allow us to perpetuate and share the traditions and customs of our special host culture.
With the "Spirit of Daniel Inouye," a C-17 Globemaster that was recently dedicated to our late Senator at a ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Mahalo to the 15th Wing for inviting me to be a part of this special event.
