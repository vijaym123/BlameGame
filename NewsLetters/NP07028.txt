Dear Friend,
I have received hundreds of
letters, emails, tweets and Facebook posts asking me over the past few
months about net neutrality.
I wanted to respond as part of my
Ask Adam video series.
Tony, a Los Angeles resident, recently
wrote an email to me: The FCC appears set to allow internet service
providers to institute a two tiered system of broadband access. This
will effectively create a slow lane and a fast lane for accessing content
online depending on how willingly sites with many users will comply
with the additional charges. I really fear the effects that this might
have on the growing tech economy that's taking root in Los Angeles. I
hope that you take a clear public stand in favor of keeping the
internet equally open to all users.
Let me state unequivocally
that I support an Open Internet, because the Internet is one of the
most important tools for free speech and the free exchange of information
in human history and I want to make sure it stays that
way.
Im opposed to proposals that would permit a fast lane for
companies that can afford to pay to reach users faster. Im opposed because
the idea of discriminating based on who can afford to pay goes against
the open architecture and the level playing field that has made the
Internet such a incredible force for innovation and democratic values. I
dont want the Internet to become a walled garden where the little
guy is shut out from competing and having his or her voice heard
because he cant pay the entry fee.
