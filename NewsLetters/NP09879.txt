Rep. Cuellar Calls for Reduction of Veterans' Benefits Backlog
Congressman Henry Cuellar spoke on the House Floor in support of increased funds to reduce the benefits claims backlog that affects many Texan veterans.
Veterans of all generations deserve a benefits system that is easy to navigate and responsive to their needs. While progress has been made, more work needs to be done so that no veteran has to wait to receive earned benefits.
I voted in support of the Fiscal Year 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, which passed the House on Wednesday evening. The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration where it is expected to be approved.
