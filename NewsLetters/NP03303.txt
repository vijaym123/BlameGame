Dear David,
As we prepare for
President Obama's State of the Union address, there are several things that
Missourians hope to hear this evening.
Instead of
continued veto threats, we hope the president will work with Congress to
help create more good-paying, full-time jobs for families and workers
in Missouri.
And at a time when we face real
threats to our nation's security, Missourians also hope President Obama
will demonstrate stronger leadership around the
world.
What would
you
like to hear?
As
always, I invite you to join this discussion online and share your
thoughts on the president's State of the Union Address on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , and on
Instagram .

my remarks before tonight's State of the Union
Address.
The new Congress is ready to enact a pro-growth,
job-creating agenda - that's what the American people asked for in November. I
hope the president will join us.
Sincere
regards,
