Friends ,
Wow, its hard to believe
2013 is coming to a close. In many ways, this was one of the most
challenging years of my life, but it was also one of the most rewarding. As
you know, this year has had its share of ups and downs.
Weve
seen sequestration take effect, the political targeting of
conservative groups by the IRS, a 16-day government shutdown, and the effects of
a fumbled foreign policy through the threat of nuclear weapons in Iran
and chemical weapons in Syria.
Perhaps most upsetting to me
is the unprecedented level of partisanship plaguing our political
system right now.
However, as trying
as this year has been for many, we have also seen great
accomplishments in North Carolina and the 8 th
District.
Weve
seen a unified NC delegation that has worked hard on issues ranging from
protecting our children
to
creating jobs right here at home ; weve
saved the
Concord airport
from the Administrations political games; weve
maintained and strengthened a relationship between NASCAR, an industry
vital to North Carolina, and our armed forces that allows us to
recruit and retain some of the most patriotic Americans ;
and we are
holding the line with the ongoing trade
negotiations
to protect our beloved textile jobs and keep
manufacturing in North Carolina. We also saw this legislative session end with a
bipartisan agreement on the budget -- a budget
that funds the government, reduces spending, tackles our deficit, and
protects our national security from the damaging effects of sequester.
While the budget agreement wasnt perfect, and I would have liked to see
deeper cuts,
it reduces the deficit and provides
stabilitysomething our country desperately
needs .
This year, we have hosted nearly 100 public events in the
8 th
District, held 10 telephone townhalls, responded to
30,000 letters from folks throughout the district, helped over 1,500
North Carolinians through casework, and guided more than 1,000 of our
citizens on tours of the U.S. Capitol.
Providing top-notch
constituent service is the most important part of my job as your
Representative and I will continue to work just as hard as we move into
2014.
As I wrote a few weeks back, the
holidays, for me, have always been a time for reflectiona time to look
back over the events of the past yearand a time to be thankful. Its
also a time to look forward and to set new goals. I am hopeful for a
very productive second session in Congress. In addition to my goals of
creating jobs, reducing our national debt, finalizing a 5-year Farm
Bill, and repealing/replacing Obamacare,
Im working hard to see
my bipartisan TSA reform bill pass the Senate and become law.
The
legislation I authored to reform TSAs
acquisition process
and save taxpayer dollars was introduced in the Senate
just this week by Senator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire and I am
optimistic it will be made law in 2014.
As
the New Year begins, you can rest assured that I will continue to be a
strong voice on behalf of our communities.
I will continue
the fight to cut wasteful government spending and put our country back
on track.
Theres a lot of work to be done, but I truly
believe its not too late to make things right. I wish all the best for you
and your loved ones in 2014, and I thank you for giving me the
privilege of being your Congressman.
Until next
week,
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
Constituent Success
Story
Recently, a constituent contacted my office
because she was having difficulty receiving her Social Security
Disability. After being denied, she appealed to the Appeals Council. The
appeals council can take up to two years to process claims, but my
office helped expedite her claim and helped her receive a favorable
decision in six months. She received $17,147.44 retroactive pay and $991.00
monthly pay.
