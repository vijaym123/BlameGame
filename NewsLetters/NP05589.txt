I&rsquo;ve been involved in politics for a long time. I&rsquo;ve seen practically everything &hellip; or so I thought.
But then
Citizens United
happened and everything changed. The Koch Brothers, big corporations, and other groups are now spending unprecedented amounts of cash to buy themselves people they can rely on in Congress -- legislators that will always back corporate special interests over the rest of us. And it&rsquo;s working.
There are already people in Congress that can thank the Kochs for getting them there.
But Democrats can&rsquo;t rely on petro-chemical billionaires to buy them elections. They rely on you.
That's why I am calling on you.
You're needed today if average Americans are to have a fighting chance on Election Day. Please stand up against the billionaires and corporate bullies who want to take over this country. Can you help, David?
