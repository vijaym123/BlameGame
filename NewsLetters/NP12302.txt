Lawmakers Support Earned Sick Leave for
Workers
The United States is one of a small number
of countries in the world without a national paid sick leave
policy.
While some U.S. cities and companies provide paid sick leave to
their employees, more than 40 million private sector workers in this
country are not able to take a paid sick day for themselves or when
there is a sick family member at home.
As a result, too many workers
are forced to choose between going to work sick, or staying home and
having their pay reduced.
Rep. Levin has joined more than 100 other House lawmakers in
introducing the Healthy Families Act [H.R. 1286] which would allow workers
to earn paid sick leave to use when they are sick, or to care for a
sick family member.
This legislation would allow millions of
working Americans to earn up to 7 days per year of paid sick time.
Workers would earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours
worked.
House Passes Resolution on Ukraine
Crisis
On February 10, the House of
Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution on the current political
and economic crisis in Ukraine.
The
resolution , which Rep. Levin cosponsored, conveys American support for the
millions of Ukrainians who are standing up in defense of democracy and
human rights as well as calls on the Ukrainian government to
immediately cease all violence and instead engage in a truly representative
national dialogue with the opposition.
In his
floor speech , Rep. Levin offered his strong support to those brave
Ukrainians and made clear to those government officials responsible for
violent acts of repression that the world is
watching.
Action
Needed to Keep Cargo Moving in the Great
Lakes
Each year, about 145 million tons of
commodities are carried through the Great Lakes.
This water-borne
commerce supports 130,000 jobs and generates over $18 billion in
revenues.
Despite the clear benefits, inadequate funding and
maintenance of the Great Lakes Navigational System
combined with water
levels near historic lows
has forced vessels to light load, grounded
vessels, impeded safe navigation, and closed
harbors.
To address the situation, a
bipartisan group of 39 House members, including Rep. Levin, recently wrote a
letter
to the Army Corps of Engineers to request
additional resources to maintain navigational locks, harbor channels,
and connecting navigational channels within the Great
Lakes.
