Friend,
My team told you yesterday that we upped our goal to $15,000 - as of now, we&#39;re $1,610 away from hitting it.
Click here now and give $5 or more to help us get there by tonight&#39;s midnight deadline.
Please know that we don&#39;t change our fundraising goals on a whim. We do it when we have to. And this week, we had to. Between Rove and the Chamber of Commerce, the opposition is coming at us from all sides - and more attacks from other outsiders are expected in the coming days.
We have to ensure that we&#39;re battle ready and able to increase our television ad buy when we need to.
What&#39;s the old adage - if you fail to plan, you should plan to fail.
Our plan? You. Click here and give $5, $10, or whatever you can immediately.
Thanks. I&#39;m glad to have you on my side.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - My race is one of the closest in the country, so the eyes of the Republican establishment are on us. These recent attacks will not be the last. We need to be ready to fight back at a moment&#39;s notice.
Click here and give $5 right now to help us stay battle ready through November.
