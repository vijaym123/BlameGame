Week in Review
Moving into the month of March,
momentum has picked up in Washington,
DC. The last couple of weeks have been
very busy.
Last week, I received the
Outstanding Senate Legislator of
the Year Award from the Disabled
American Veterans (DAV) in recognition
of my support of wounded, injured and
ill veterans, their families and
survivors. It is truly humbling to have
been chosen as the first Senator to
receive this award. I am greatly
appreciative of the DAV for working
with me to tackle issues like the VA
claims backlog, treatment for
post-traumatic stress, and care for our
women veterans.
I also worked closely with the
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), meeting
with Nevada members to discuss key
issues and raising important questions
to Commander John Stroud, a fellow
Nevadan, during the Veterans' Affairs
Committee hearing. I was honored to be
given the chance to introduce Commander
Stroud during the hearing. To watch the

The bipartisan
Campus
Accountability and Safety Act
(CASA) was reintroduced in February,
once again bringing necessary attention
to the reality of sexual assault across
college campuses. The bipartisan
legislation currently has 12 supporters
from both sides of the aisle and would
create higher accountability for
colleges and universities and better
resources for survivors.
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin
Netanyahu's visit to Congress was a
special moment. He had valuable insight
on current geopolitics in the Middle
East, especially regarding Iran. Having
personally traveled to Israel, I know
firsthand the challenges Israel, our
strongest ally, faces to protect its
people. Now, more than ever, the United
States must stand with Israel and its
right to defend itself.
Congress also worked to send a
message to the President, making clear
its disappointment in his veto of the
Keystone XL pipeline. We
voted
in favor of overriding the President's
decision 62 to 37, five votes short of
the amount needed to override President
Obama's veto.
I introduced and cosponsored
numerous bills throughout the last two
weeks:
Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of
2015
: This bill enhances outdoor
recreational opportunities and makes it
easier for businesses in the industry
to grow and hire.
Legislation to eliminate
unfair tax bills
: Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and I
introduced this legislation to ensure
when homeowners work with their banks
to reduce their mortgage payments,
those homeowners will not be hit with a
huge tax bill. I am grateful to
serve as your voice on Capitol Hill and
will continue to represent your views
in Washington, DC.
