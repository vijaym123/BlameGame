Dear Friends,
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has finally released its study of Asian Carp and how to keep this destructive invasive species out of the Great Lakes.
( See the report here ).
As ranking member on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, protecting the Lake Erie fishery and tourism industry is one of my top priorities.
The report is certain to generate considerable debate and discussion. The Corps of Engineers is accepting comments on the report.
You can make comments
here .
Also, the Corps is conducting a series of public hearings, including Cleveland on Thursday, January 17.
For more information on the public hearings, click
here .
No region of the country has more at stake in this issue than northern Ohio.
I will do everything I can to help the region successfully meet the challenge of invasive species in general and the Asian Carp in particular.
If you have any comments or concern, please feel free to share them with the
Corps of Engineers
and
with me .
Sincerely,
U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur
Representing Ohio&rsquo;s 9th Congressional District

CORRECTION:
A bullet point in a recent newsletter incorrectly stated that the government had sold its stock in General Motors &ldquo;at a profit.&rdquo; It should have read, &ldquo;When the books are closed, Treasury&rsquo;s Asset Relief Program (TARP) will have operated at a profit.&rdquo; Although the auto rescue cost approximately $10 billion, the government has recovered approximately $11 billion over its $421.8 billion investment in the TARP overall.
