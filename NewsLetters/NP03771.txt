Seasons Greetings
Friend:
It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve you during the
113 th
Congress, and I look forward to working hard on your
behalf over the next two-year term.
While our nation has met some of
its challenges, such as reducing the number of people who lack health
insurance and reducing the backlog of veteran disability claims, much
remains to be done.
I will continue to speak for you, promoting
policies that generate jobs and the economic growth of our region,
advocating for legislation to reduce poverty and improving access to a
quality education for all of our citizens.
Click on the video to watch Rep. Fudges remarks on the impact of the
Ferguson Grand Jury Decision on the House
floor.
During the past year, police-involved
shooting deaths in Ferguson, MO, Cleveland and elsewhere stirred
Americans to demand an end to discriminatory law enforcement practices that
violate the constitutional rights of our citizens, or worse, lead to
tragic and avoidable loss of life.
While this demand will
require vigilance and continued community engagement, I am hopeful that in
2015 we can begin to implement the reforms I urged the Department of
Justice to include in its recently concluded investigation of the City
of Cleveland Division of Police.

on this and many other issues, as well as my legislative
accomplishments of the past year.
As 2014 draws to a close, I would also
like to remind my constituents that this office is here to serve you.
During the 113 th
Congress, I have advocated for
federal grants that distributed approximately $1 billion to our district --
covering everything from economic development to nutrition programs,
and from public transportation to medical research at our hospitals and
universities.
My office has helped constituents claim federal
benefits to which they were entitled, with a value of more than
$804,000.
I wish you a joyous holiday season and a Happy New Year.
May the peace, hope and good cheer of this wonderful time of year
be with you and your families.
