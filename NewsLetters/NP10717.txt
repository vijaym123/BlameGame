Dear Neighbors,
I recently met a young mother at a roundtable discussion I hosted on
long-term unemployment. During this harsh winter, she would return from
a long day of job hunting, prepare dinner for her two young children
and then jump into bed to eat together under the covers. You see, since
losing her unemployment insurance, she's forced to choose between
paying her heating bill or her rent.
I also met a woman in Highland Park who lost her job at a travel
agency, and now she and her husband dip into the savings they put aside
for the children's education to make ends meet.
This is now the reality for more than 2 million people nationwide-more
than 150,000 in Illinois-and yet there has not been a single vote in
the House to extend unemployment insurance.
Partisanship and gridlock have already cost millions their emergency
unemployment insurance. Furthermore, it's been estimated that failing
to act will cost our economy 240,000 jobs this year.
Refusing to extend unemployment insurance hurts families, it hurts
businesses, it hurts communities and it hurts our economy.
That's why I introduced a measure last month to force an end to the
gridlock on extending unemployment insurance. More than 190 of my
colleagues joined me to demand a vote in the House. The next day, the
Senate announced a preliminary deal
to extend this critical
insurance, and now, the Senate has passed an extension bill. The time
has come for the House to act.
I believe extending unemployment insurance is not just smart policy;
it's the right thing to do.
I respect that some of my colleagues have a different view about the
importance of unemployment insurance, and I respect their right to vote
"no." But not allowing the House of Representatives a vote on the
matter is simply unacceptable.
I know the path ahead will not be easy, but our communities deserve
better than this partisan gridlock.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Neighbors,
I
recently
met
a
young
mother
at
a
roundtable
discussion
I
hosted
on
long-term
unemployment.
During
this
harsh
winter,
she
would
return
from
a
long
day
of
job
hunting,
prepare
dinner
for
her
two
young
children
and
then
jump
into
bed
to
eat
together
under
the
covers.
You
see,
since
losing
her
unemployment
insurance,
she's
forced
to
choose
between
paying
her
heating
bill
or
her
rent.
I
also
met
a
woman
in
Highland
Park
who
lost
her
job
at
a
travel
agency,
and
now
she
and
her
husband
dip
into
the
savings
they
put
aside
for
the
children&#8217;s
education
to
make
ends
meet.
This
is
now
the
reality
for
more
than
2
million
people
nationwide&#8212;more
than
150,000
in
Illinois&#8212;and
yet
there
has
not
been
a
single
vote
in
the
House
to
extend
unemployment
insurance.
Partisanship
and
gridlock
have
already
cost
millions
their
emergency
unemployment
insurance.
Furthermore,
it's
been
estimated
that
failing
to
act
will
cost
our
economy
240,000
jobs
this
year.
Refusing
to
extend
unemployment
insurance
hurts
families,
it
hurts
businesses,
it
hurts
communities
and
it
hurts
our
economy.
That&#8217;s
why
I
introduced
a
measure
last
month
to
force
an
end
to
the
gridlock
on
extending
unemployment
insurance.
More
than
190
of
my
colleagues
joined
me
to
demand
a
vote
in
the
House.
The
next
day,
the
Senate
announced
a
preliminary
deal
to
extend
this
critical
insurance,
and
now,
the
Senate
has
passed
an
extension
bill.
The
time
has
come
for
the
House
to
act.
I
believe
extending
unemployment
insurance
is
not
just
smart
policy;
it&#8217;s
the
right
thing
to
do.
I
respect
that
some
of
my
colleagues
have
a
different
view
about
the
importance
of
unemployment
insurance,
and
I
respect
their
right
to
vote
&#8220;no.&#8221;
But
not
allowing
the
House
of
Representatives
a
vote
on
the
matter
is
simply
unacceptable.
I
know
the
path
ahead
will
not
be
easy,
but
our
communities
deserve
better
than
this
partisan
gridlock.
