Happy Father's
Day
Yesterday, my daughter Caroline and I had a
wonderful afternoon together at the Deanna Rose Farmstead in Overland Park
to celebrate Father's Day. Happy Father's Day to my dad Wayne and all
of the other great fathers out there.
Mourning the Victims of the Charleston Shooting
Our
hearts break for the families and lost loved ones struck down in their
place of worship in Charleston, South Carolina last week. This
tragedy brings back painful memories of the shootings in Overland Park last
year. No person in America should fear for their safety when going to
their place of worship - the freedom to exercise our chosen religion
is a bedrock principle enshrined in our Bill of Rights. During moments
like this more than ever, we must stand together united against hate
and evil.
Halfway Through the Appropriations Process
The House of Representatives and the Appropriations Committee have been
working diligently to ensure the appropriations process is completed
in a timely manner. This is the earliest the House has begun the
process since 1974.
With my support,
the House has already passed six of the 12 appropriations
bills:
Military Construction and Veteran
Affairs
( H.R. 2029 ): Secures funding
necessary to provide for our veterans when they come home and invests
in our military infrastructure.
Energy and
Water
( H.R. 2028 ):
Provides necessary resources for Americas infrastructure, including our
electric grid, nuclear stockpiles, and critical water projects.
Legislative Funding
( H.R. 2250 ): Continues the pay freeze for Members
of Congress that has been in place since 2010 and blocks any added
funding, putting us on a fiscally-responsible track to save even more
money for the taxpayers.
Commerce, Justice, and
Science Funding
( H.R.
2578 ): Provides resources for the FBI to keep us safe, reprioritizes
funds to give additional support in combating counterterrorism and
cybercrime, and increases funding for
NASA.
Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development
( H.R. 2577 ): Supports our interstate highway
system, maintains efficient and safe air and rail transportation, and
ensures that our housing safety net will be there for elderly and disabled
tenants of public housing.
Defense
( H.R. 2685 ): Funds military
operations, readiness, and health and safety programs for our soldiers, while
giving our troops a much needed pay raise.
Reining in the
EPA
Last Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee passed the
2016 Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill
by a vote
of 30-21 with my support. The bill provides $30.17 billion in base
funding for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, and other
various related agencies. This is a decrease of $246 million below
fiscal year 2015 and $3 billion below the Presidents Budget
Request.
The bill also includes an important
provision that prohibits any funding from being used to develop, adopt,
implement, administer, or enforce any changes to the definition of
"waters" under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. This is in
response to the EPA's proposed rule that would require businesses,
farmers, and ranchers to comply with requirements for thousands of small
streams, ditches, ponds, and other isolated bodies of water on private
lands that have no connection to navigable waters the Clean Water Act
was designed to
protect.
Regulations from central planners in Washington have been breaking the
backs of businesses in Kansas and across America under this
Administration. The EPAs proposed rule would extend its jurisdiction to regulate
water anywhere it could conceivably run
from a creek flowing through
your back yard to a puddle in your driveway
with the staggering
compliance costs falling largely in the laps of American farmers and
ranchers. That means higher prices at the grocery store for you and your
family.
This bill halts that rule from
going into effect and ensures that farmers and small business owners
will have the opportunity to grow their business and create jobs with
capital that would otherwise be wasted on compliance costs. I commend
the efforts of Interior Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert and urge the
rest of my colleagues in the House to support this provisions
inclusion in the final bill.
Encouraging Community Service

Lokre of Overland Park.
Last Wednesday, I presented
four students from the Third District with the Congressional Award Gold
Medal for their impressive record of community service. To receive
the award, applicants must be between 14 and 23 years old and have set
and achieved goals in volunteer public service, personal development,
physical fitness, and exploration of another culture over a minimum of
24 months.

of Overland Park.
This years
winners from the Third District are Matthew Connell and Patrick
Connell of Lenexa, and Shivani Lokre and Grace McGowan of Overland
Park.

Kansas boasts some of
the best and brightest young people in America, and Matthew, Patrick,
Shivani, and Grace stand out among the crowd for their selfless
dedication to their community. With many states not having a single
individual earn this award, Im proud to say we have four from the Third
District. Wednesday's ceremony was a culmination of two years of hard work
on their behalf, and I was honored to present them with their
Congressional Award Gold Medals.
