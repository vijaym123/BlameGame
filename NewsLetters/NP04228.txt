Dear Friends,
Happy Thanksgiving!
I hope this newsletter finds you and
your loved ones happy and healthy this Thanksgiving week. As we open
our hearts and homes for friends and family, I hope you join me in
taking a moment to give thanks for all we care deepest about in America.
The holiday is a time when we gather around to join together to
celebrate our friendships and our family. America shines brightest when
we can all put aside our differences and join together for the common
good. It starts at home, and in our neighborhoods and
communities.
Traditionally, Thanksgiving is about showing gratitude
for the harvest and for everything we have received in the past year.
In New Mexico, we are fortunate to have an economy based on
agriculture. We celebrate our farmers and ranchers, and those who work every day
to produce the red and green chile, the pecans, the dairy and produce
for our markets. I was blessed to grow up raising pigs and showing
them at the fair. Our farmers continue to pass this valuable tradition
on to their children, to keep our economy strong.
This
is also a time to give thanks for all we have as a nation. I believe
we are a nation that has been blessed by God. In the Bible, Paul
speaks of Gods will in giving thanks. He says: "Be joyful always; pray
continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is Gods will for
you in Christ Jesus."
I have seen this, especially this
year, with those who have prayed for my mother in her time of need, and
for my friends who have passed away. I have made so many new
friendships during the many visits I had with constituents and
communities.
New Mexicans know the true meaning of friendship, charity and
helping those less fortunate. When women and children from Central
America were brought here to New Mexico, not everyone agreed in principle
that this was the right thing to do. But, people throughout our
communities reached out to them, asking what they could do to provide food,
clothing and necessities.
As a state and a nation, it is
easy to focus on our problems. But, we also need to remember to give
thanks for what we do have. I hope we can remember to carry the spirit
of Thanksgiving with us every day.
I hope that you
also take a moment this holiday, to remember those men and women serving
in the Armed Forces, who will not be home with family and friends.
Our debt of gratitude for our soldiers and those who serve abroad can
never be repaid, and they are especially remembered this time of
year.
God Bless you and your family. Happy Thanksgiving to
all!
Have you heard "Congressional Review" this week?
Every weekend, I'm on the radio across New Mexico discussing
important legislation, events in New Mexico, and my work in Congress.
Be
sure to tune in!
If you haven't heard the show, call your local
radio station to ask when Congressional Review is on the air in your
hometown!
Remember, I always look forward to hearing your thoughts
on how to help job growth, veterans, and other issues important to New
Mexicans.
If you have any ideas, suggestions, or concerns, you

America.
