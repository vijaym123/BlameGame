Dear David,
When it comes to unnecessary government red tape, I think most Missourians agree we need a whole lot less of it - especially when it comes to promoting jobs and business opportunities in our state.
That's why I've introduced a bill that aims to make it easier for Missouri businesses to cut through red tape on projects that will create and expand good-paying jobs. The
Federal Permitting Improvement Act
- which I introduced with my Republican colleague Senator Rob Portman of Ohio - would streamline and speed up the federal permitting process, which right now is bogged down by uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncoordinated federal review that hinders investment and growth.
Getting bills passed through Congress these days can feel like an impossible task, but this one might be the one to break through the partisan gridlock. This week, it was approved with a bipartisan vote in the Senate Homeland Security Committee. And
Bloomberg
recently described
it as the "legislation seen as having the best chance of locking down enough Democrats for Senate approval," among more than a half-dozen bills aimed at revamping regulatory procedures.

As I expressed when telling Bloomberg, "we might just have a miracle here. We might have Republicans, Democrats, and the White House agree on something, and that would be extraordinary."
But the work isn't done yet. Following this week's passage through the Committee, it's on to a vote before the full Senate - when that happens I'll be sure to keep you up-to-date on the bill's final steps.
We've made a lot of progress expanding job opportunities and getting folks back to work since the recession, and now isn't the time to let up.
With businesses groups, trade organizations, and a growing number of Republicans and Democrats all on the same page, this is a no brainer: let's cut the red tape out of the federal permitting process and make government work faster and more efficiently in Missouri and across the country.
All the best,
P.S. Stay up-to-date as I work to get this bill across the finish line by finding me on
