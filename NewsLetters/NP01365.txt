Answer President Obama&rsquo;s call and have your gift DOUBLE MATCHED! &gt;&gt;
David -- President Obama emailed this morning with an urgent message. He wouldn&rsquo;t have written if it weren&rsquo;t incredibly important, so please read this email from start to finish:
The right-wing money machine is
all in
to elect the likes of Ted Cruz (who raised $31 million in just days!) or Rand Paul, and fill the Senate with extremists just like them.
If the GOP wins, you can kiss all of our progress goodbye.|
But President Obama gets it: He knows that
if Democrats start investing early enough (RIGHT NOW), we can prevent the devastation
of Republicans controlling the White House AND the Senate. That&rsquo;s why he asked for your urgent help: Because
Social Security and Medicare, the Supreme Court, and our economic recovery are all on the line.
We&rsquo;re DOUBLE MATCHING all gifts before midnight tomorrow to answer the President&rsquo;s call for early support. Will you pitch in?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;

Or donate another amount .
President Obama spoke from his own experience this morning:
&ldquo;I know the value of an early gift. I was thankful for it when the DSCC became an important force behind my election to the Senate in 2004. And in 2008, they helped elect a strong Democratic majority that was able to pass some of the biggest achievements of my presidency.&quot;
So please, if you don&rsquo;t want to see Republicans dismantle the progress we&rsquo;ve made, donate to the DSCC.
Thank you, David.
