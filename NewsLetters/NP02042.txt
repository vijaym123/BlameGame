Response to Interior Department
Fracking Regulations
3/20/15
Today the Department of
Interior released new rules for hydraulic fracturing and drilling on
federal land. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is an advanced
engineering technology that supports more than 2 million U.S. Jobs, has
increased supplies of oil and natural gas, decreased energy prices, and has
strengthened Americas geopolitical leverage against hostile regimes
around the
world.
While the President may like to highlight the
benefits of increased energy production, the actions of his
Administration are ultimately standing in the way of increased natural gas
production in America. The regulations announced today are simply designed
to make it more difficult to develop American energy by adding yet
another layer of onerous regulation crafted to drive American energy
development away from federal land. The process of hydraulic fracturing is
already a carefully regulated technology that has been used safely
for more than 65 years in more than 1 million wells across the country.
Even Interior Secretary Jewell,
a former petroleum engineer with
hydraulic fracturing experience, stated in response to my questioning
that hydraulic fracturing, "absolutely can be done safely and
responsibly and has been done safely and responsibly. As Chairman of the
Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, I will
continue to push back against any duplicative federal regulation that
will cost American jobs and increase energy prices while providing no
environmental or safety
benefit.
