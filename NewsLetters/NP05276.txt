David, I&rsquo;ve had it up to here! It&rsquo;s bad enough Republicans block every good idea we send them.
But now they&rsquo;re going after my friend -- and a darn good Democrat -- Brad Schneider. As you read this, Republicans are in the midst of an
$8 MILLION assault
on Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district.
Why? Brad&rsquo;s fighting day in and day out for the issues you care about most -- issues like equal pay for equal work, LGBT rights, and saving our Great Lakes from polluting companies. Boehner can&rsquo;t stand it!
David, with 14 days to go, Brad&rsquo;s race is all tied up. Will you pitch in and help win this one for Brad? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for doing your part,
