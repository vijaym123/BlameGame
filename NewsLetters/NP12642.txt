Dear Friend,
I am
proud to share that yesterday the Senate passed my Homeowner Flood
Insurance Affordability Act that will provide much needed relief to
thousands of homeowners in New Jersey and across the country.
And it
wouldnt have happened without your persistence.
Over the
past several months, Ive heard from over 5,000 New Jerseyans about the
devastating impact of skyrocketing flood insurance rates.
Middle
class families are hurting as rate hikes threaten to force them from
their homes.
As our state rebuilds from a natural disaster,
we shouldnt have to struggle through a man-made disaster too.
And as we worked to correct this wrong in the Senate, it was my honor
to represent you in this fight.

By passing this flood insurance bill,
we can take a huge step forward to help the people who played by the
rules their whole lives and are now facing skyrocketing rates they
never could have prepared or planned for.
Now
lets tell the
House of Representatives its up to them to finish the job, because
the consequence of inaction is a cost we cannot
bear.
Thank you for your support.
Sincerely,
Robert
Menendez
United States Senator
