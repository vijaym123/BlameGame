Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. I believe it is important
to keep the people at home informed about how their congressman is
representing them. I always put my constituents and the 5th District of
Louisiana first in any decision that I make. The best way for me to
know how to serve you is for you to provide feedback on the things you
read in this newsletter. I want to hear from you.
In the District
Meeting with Monroe City School officials at J.S. Clark Magnet School
in Monroe about the school lunch program. I enjoyed having lunch with
the officials and students.
I got a tour of the facilities of the U.S. Marshal's Office in
Alexandria. Thank you for the tour and your service to our country!
I got details of the new air park in East Feliciana Parish. I also met
with local officials about their plans to use the air park as an
economic development driver that can lift the entire region.
Social Media
I've received a lot of positive feedback about our social media sites.
People like that I update them daily with what's going on in Congress,
and you receive info about where I'll be in the district. Make sure
you've "liked" us on Facebook
and followed us on Twitter

Recent Legislation
Flood Management Standard: I passed my first piece of legislation last
month. It was an amendment to defund the President's new Federal Flood
Risk Management Standard. The President drafted this new standard in
secret, received no input from stakeholders and implemented it with
unilateral action. It could cause higher flood insurance rates and
greatly increased living and business costs for much of Louisiana. I
was proud to prevent funding this program, thereby protecting our state
and all those living in flood plains from this extreme new standard.
Veterans Accountability Act: I'm an original cosponsor on legislation
introduced by my colleague Jeff Miller that gives the Department of
Veterans Affairs more authority to fire problem employees. No one has
been held accountable for so many of the problems with the department
that are plaguing our veterans. The VA says it's too hard to fire
people, well, this bill fixes that. It's well past time we bring
accountability to the VA and begin to get our heroes the care they
deserve.
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: The House passed a bill that
makes abortions after 20 weeks illegal. Babies feel pain at 20 weeks.
As a doctor, I was proud to cosponsor this common-sense legislation to
protect the most vulnerable members of our society.
Art Competition
Congratulations to Anna Catherine Graves of Ouachita Christian School
in Monroe for winning the Congressional High School Art Competition!
Her work, "New Orleans Blues," will hang in the U.S. Capitol next year
alongside winners from districts around the nation.
