MSNBC&rsquo;s Morning Joe reports, &ldquo;There are about 10 states where there are races within 3, 4 points -- this is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen in a recent election.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Any Republican right now saying they&rsquo;re going to take the Senate is a fool&rdquo;

Morning Joe
reports, &ldquo;There are about 10 states where there are races within 3, 4 points --
this is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen in a recent election.&rdquo;
But can Democrats pull out a victory? It honestly depends on you.
Morning Joe
continues,
&ldquo;If Democrats execute on the ground... they&rsquo;ll hold the Senate.&rdquo;
Grassroots supporters have put us in an EXCELLENT spot with six days left (thank you!).
But we&rsquo;ve got only 48 hours to fund the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push, and we&rsquo;re still $1,807,012 short. If we don&#39;t fill that budget hole and miss out on contacting tens of thousands of voters, the Senate will fall to McConnell and the Republicans.
Will you pitch in to the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Weekend GOTV Push before the end-of-month deadline in 48 hours? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift.
