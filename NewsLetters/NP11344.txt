Friend,
Thanks for making this week's Neighborhood Conversation a great
success.
As always, I enjoyed hearing directly from you about the
issues most important to you, and please keep the advice and guidance
coming.
Because Congress was out of session this week, I was able to
spend more time home in Rhode Island and I want to share a few of this
week's highlights with you.
Celebrating St. Patrick's Day and St. Joseph's Day
I was pleased to march with federal, state, and local leaders in the
58thAnnual Newport St. Patrick's Day Parade.
Despite a little cold
weather, there was an impressive turnout and it was great to see so
many members of the Rhode Island community come out to support this
annual event.
It was great to enjoy a zeppole and celebrate St.
Joseph's Day at the Sal Mancini Senior Resource and Activity Center in
North Providence.
These holidays serve as an important reminder about
Rhode Island's rich cultural heritage and the many communities that
contribute to our wonderful state. As a proud Italian-American, St.
Joseph's Day is always a great celebration.
Congress at Your Company
As part of my "Congress at Your Company" series, I visited Innovex's
headquarters in Lincoln earlier this week.
Innovex is a family owned
company that provides customer support technology services to clients
of all business sizes. During my two terms in Congress I have worked to
promote job creation and support Rhode Island's business community.
I
continue to fight for the Make it in America agenda that makes smart
investments in manufacturing and supports small business expansion.
Supporting advanced manufacturing and our business community is
critical to promoting job growth, but we also need to make targeted
investments in job training and early childhood programs to close the
skills gap and to help Rhode Islanders compete in today's global
marketplace.
Helping Homebound Seniors
To support Meals On Wheels' March for Meals campaign, I helped deliver
nutritious food to homebound low-income seniors on Monday.
I was happy
to lend a helping hand to Meals On Wheels, whose staff and volunteers
give so much to help Rhode Island's senior population.
According to
Meals On Wheels, over 36,300 seniors in Rhode Island are struggling
with hunger and approximately 9,830 Rhode Islanders receive help from
the Meals On Wheels program.
In Congress, I worked to restore funding
for the Elderly Nutrition Program, which supports community-based
services, like Meals On Wheels, that help older Americans who may be at
risk of losing their independence.
Senior assistance programs are too
often underfunded and I will continue to work to support evidence-based
programs that help older Americans live in dignity, maintain healthy
lifestyles, and remain independent.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov
My best always,
David Cicilline

Friend,
Thanks
for
making
this
week&#8217;s
Neighborhood
Conversation
a
great
success.
As
always,
I
enjoyed
hearing
directly
from
you
about
the
issues
most
important
to
you,
and
please
keep
the
advice
and
guidance
coming.
Because
Congress
was
out
of
session
this
week,
I
was
able
to
spend
more
time
home
in
Rhode
Island
and
I
want
to
share
a
few
of
this
week&#8217;s
highlights
with
you.
Celebrating
St.
Patrick&#8217;s
Day
and
St.
Joseph&#8217;s
Day
I
was
pleased
to
march
with
federal,
state,
and
local
leaders
in
the
58 th Annual
Newport
St.
Patrick&#8217;s
Day
Parade.
Despite
a
little
cold
weather,
there
was
an
impressive
turnout
and
it
was
great
to
see
so
many
members
of
the
Rhode
Island
community
come
out
to
support
this
annual
event.
It
was
great
to

and

St.

at
the
Sal

These
holidays
serve
as
an
important
reminder
about
Rhode
Island&#8217;s
rich
cultural
heritage
and
the
many
communities
that
contribute
to
our
wonderful
state. As
a
proud
Italian-American,
St.
Joseph&#8217;s
Day
is
always
a
great
celebration.
Congress
at
Your
Company
As
part
of
my
&#8220;Congress
at
Your
Company&#8221;
series,
I
visited
Innovex&#8217;s
headquarters
in
Lincoln
earlier
this
week.
Innovex
is
a
family
owned
company
that
provides
customer
support
technology
services
to
clients
of
all
business
sizes.
During
my
two
terms
in
Congress
I
have
worked
to
promote
job
creation
and
support
Rhode
Island&#8217;s
business
community.
I
continue
to
fight
for
the
Make
it
in
America
agenda
that
makes
smart
investments
in
manufacturing
and
supports
small
business
expansion.
Supporting
advanced
manufacturing
and
our
business
community
is
critical
to
promoting
job
growth,
but
we
also
need
to
make
targeted
investments
in
job
training
and
early
childhood
programs
to
close
the
skills
gap
and
to
help
Rhode
Islanders
compete
in
today&#8217;s
global
marketplace.
Helping
Homebound

To

I

a

hand
to
Meals

whose
staff
and

Senior

programs
are

that
