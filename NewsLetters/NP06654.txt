Friend,
My name is Olga Batey, and I&#39;m a volunteer for Ami Bera for Congress.
At 90 years old, I know what&#39;s important. Family, friends, and the future of this country I love so much. Ami also understands what&#39;s important, and that&#39;s what he&#39;s fighting for in Congress - which is why I&#39;m giving my all to his campaign.
Have you seen those Karl Rove ads?
They&#39;re nasty and misleading.
Even our local newspaper said as much - which is why Ami needs us.
I donated $250 to his campaign, because I want to stand with him.
Will you join me by giving $5 or more today?
Ami&#39;s team is hard at work, and they love having us volunteer at the office.
And, I know from spending time there, that they have a tight budget and are working under a deadline.
From what I&#39;m told, they&#39;re trying to raise $10,000 by
next Tuesday
to keep their TV ad up on air.
This is urgent - they need these ads to fight back against the negative attacks that are flooding our homes.
Will you join me in supporting Ami&#39;s campaign?
Pitch in $5 or more today so the truth will come out about these false attacks.
We need your help right now to hit this goal before the budget deadline.
Elections come and go, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of them in my time. Believe me when I say that Ami is something special. I know he&#39;s fighting for us. Now, let&#39;s fight for him.
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Olga Batey
P.S.
Give $5 now to Bera for Congress so volunteers like myself have the resources we need to speak with voters.
Or, join me in the office for a volunteer shift-- call Ami&#39;s team at 916-741-2372 to sign up today.
