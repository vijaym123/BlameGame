FROM THE DESK OF CONGRESSMAN YOHO
Friends,
On Thursday, I joined Congressman Pete Olson of Texas in bringing up
Articles of Impeachment against Attorney General Eric Holder.
Impeachment proceedings should never be taken lightly, however, our
Founding Fathers empowered Congress with this all important ability to
ensure our nation would never fall prey to the tyranny they fought
valiantly against. Our nation is one of, by, and for the people and we
should never forget that. However, when officials begin to disregard
the rule of law our nation goes from one of public service to one of
self-service. Attorney General Holder has shown a blatant and repeated
pattern of disrespect for the laws of our nation, and deception towards
Congress and the American people.
An Attorney General who fails to enforce the law is one who violates
the very essence of the office. Whether failure to enforce portions of
the Defense of Marriage Act, failure to prosecute individuals at the
Internal Revenue Service who illegally targeted groups based on
political philosophy, or providing false information to Congress during
multiple investigations, the Attorney General has repeatedly abused his
position as the head of the Department of Justice.
As egregious as Operation Fast and Furious was, the Attorney General's
handling of the aftermath showed he had little regard for the gravity
of the situation. An American border patrol agent lost his life. And
instead of cooperating with the resulting investigation, the Attorney
General misled Congress and obstructed the oversight investigation.
Congress has a Constitutional responsibility to provide accountability
and oversight of the Executive Branch. Regardless of party, the top
attorney of the United States should be held to the highest standard.
If justice is not served by the very department that shares its name,
the foundation from which this country was established is completely
undermined.
Your government should be accountable to you, and this is an important
step in changing a Federal government that has lost sight of that very
important fact. Rest assured, I will keep you informed as these
impeachment proceedings move forward.
Best,
Ted

BILL SPOTLIGHT
H.R. 284
The Congressional Accountability Pay Act of 2013
I proudly cosponsored this legislation with Rep. Forbes of Virginia.
This bill would reduce the pay for Members of Congress proportionally
to the percentage increase in government spending over the previous
year. For example, if spending increased by 5%, our salaries would be
cut by 5%. I am in favor of this legislation because it holds us
accountable for spending your hard-earned tax dollars. You can read
more about the legislation here.

FROM
THE
DESK
OF
CONGRESSMAN
YOHO
Friends,
On
Thursday,
I
joined
Congressman
Pete
Olson
of
Texas
in
bringing
up
Articles
of
Impeachment
against
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder.
Impeachment
proceedings
should
never
be
taken
lightly,
however,
our
Founding
Fathers
empowered
Congress
with
this
all
important
ability
to
ensure
our
nation
would
never
fall
prey
to
the
tyranny
they
fought
valiantly
against.
Our
nation
is
one
of,
by,
and
for
the
people
and
we
should
never
forget
that.
However,
when
officials
begin
to
disregard
the
rule
of
law
our
nation
goes
from
one
of
public
service
to
one
of
self-service.
Attorney
General
Holder
has
shown
a
blatant
and
repeated
pattern
of
disrespect
for
the
laws
of
our
nation,
and
deception
towards
Congress
and
the
American
people.
An
Attorney
General
who
fails
to
enforce
the
law
is
one
who
violates
the
very
essence
of
the
office.
Whether
failure
to
enforce
portions
of
the
Defense
of
Marriage
Act,
failure
to
prosecute
individuals
at
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
who
illegally
targeted
groups
based
on
political
philosophy,
or
providing
false
information
to
Congress
during
multiple
investigations,
the
Attorney
General
has
repeatedly
abused
his
position
as
the
head
of
the
Department
of
Justice.
As
egregious
as
Operation
Fast
and
Furious
was,
the
Attorney
General's
handling
of
the
aftermath
showed
he
had
little
regard
for
the
gravity
of
the
situation.
An
American
border
patrol
agent
lost
his
life.
And
instead
of
cooperating
with
the
resulting
investigation,
the
Attorney
General
misled
Congress
and
obstructed
the
oversight
investigation.
Congress
has
a
Constitutional
responsibility
to
provide
accountability
and
oversight
of
the
Executive
Branch.
Regardless
of
party,
the
top
attorney
of
the
United
States
should
be
held
to
the
highest
standard.
If
justice
is
not
served
by
the
very
department
that
shares
its
name,
the
foundation
from
which
this
country
was
established
is
completely
undermined.
Your
government
should
be
accountable
to
you,
and
this
is
an
important
step
in
changing
a
Federal
government
that
has
lost
sight
of
that
very
important
fact.
Rest
assured,
I
will
keep
you
informed
as
these
impeachment
proceedings
move
forward.
Best,
Ted
