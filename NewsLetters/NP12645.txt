Dear
Friend,
On Tuesday,
President Obama delivered his State of the Union address and spoke to
the country about making 2014 a year of action. Theres a wide variety
of issues affecting communities here in Los Angeles and all across
America. I agree that this year, in contrast to 2013, should be a year to
take on our biggest challenges and get things done. As your voice in
Washington, its important that I hear directly from you so that I can
better represent and serve our community. Please take a moment to let
me know which issues you think Congress should work on this
year. What are your top
priorities for Congress in 2014? Creating jobs and growing the middle class Passing commonsense immigration
reform Implementing and
improving the Affordable Care Act Reducing the federal debt and deficits Passing gun violence prevention
legislation Strengthening Medicare and Social Security
Protecting the environment and addressing climate
change Exploring sources
of alternative energy and domestic energy independence Fortifying defense and national
security Safeguarding
Americans privacy and reforming surveillance programs Are there other
priorities?
