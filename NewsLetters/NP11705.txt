Dear Friends,
President Obama&rsquo;s recent visit highlighted efforts to give Americans a raise. I was honored to join the Connecticut delegation at my alma mater and commend the President for fighting on behalf of working families.

From providing fairer pay and strengthening job training to helping students gain the education they deserve, the President is working to move our nation forward. In our state, Governor Malloy is leading the way in raising wages for Connecticut residents.
The President said it right at CCSU; now is the time for Congress to get on board. As an original cosponsor of legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 by 2015, I have joined many Americans and our delegation who understand a higher minimum wage lifts millions out of poverty and increases economic activity nationwide. Looking ahead, I will continue to call on Washington to join our fight and raise the minimum wage for the American people.
