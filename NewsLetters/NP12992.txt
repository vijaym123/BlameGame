Bipartisan Agreement Restores Budget Stability
Dear Friend,
Last week, Congress reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the federal
government through the end of September and provide much needed
economic stability for our nation. I supported this legislation (H.R.
3547), which prevents another wasteful and irresponsible government
shutdown and eases reckless budget cuts under the sequester that have
hurt our economy. In addition, the agreement protects disabled military
veterans and their families from a misguided pension cut set to take
effect next year.
The agreement restores resources that are critical to Pennsylvania's
health and economic growth, including funding for early childhood
education, local transportation infrastructure improvements, and
National Institutes of Health (NIH) research. Specifically, the
legislation fully restores cuts to the Head Start preschool program,
which was forced to reduce enrollment due to the sequester. The
additional NIH funding is an important step toward undoing the
sequester's damage, but I will keep fighting to ensure Pennsylvania's
medical research centers have the most robust support possible to
continue their lifesaving work.
Unfortunately the funding agreement did not include an extension of
emergency unemployment benefits for 1.5 million Americans and their
families. I believe it is inexcusable that the Republican-led House
adjourned for a weeklong break without passing legislation to restore
this assistance. This important economic lifeline affects more than
80,000 Pennsylvanians who want to work so they can support their
families, pay their bills, and build for the future (Source
). I will continue urging
Republicans to join Democrats to extend unemployment insurance and
restore security for millions of Americans and their families.
I encourage you to visit my website
and my Facebook
page for more information about my work on
these important issues. As always, it is an honor to represent you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Bipartisan
Agreement
Restores
Budget
Stability
Dear
Friend,
Last
week,
Congress
reached
a
bipartisan
agreement
to
fund
the
federal
government
through
the
end
of
September
and
provide
much
needed
economic
stability
for
our
nation.
I
supported
this
legislation
(H.R.
3547),
which
prevents
another
wasteful
and
irresponsible
government
shutdown
and
eases
reckless
budget
cuts
under
the
sequester
that
have
hurt
our
economy.
In
addition,
the
agreement
protects
disabled
military
veterans
and
their
families
from
a
misguided
pension
cut
set
to
take
effect
next
year.
The
agreement
restores
resources
that
are
critical
to
Pennsylvania&#8217;s
health
and
economic
growth,
including
funding
for
early
childhood
education,
local
transportation
infrastructure
improvements,
and
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
research.
Specifically,
the
legislation
fully
restores
cuts
to
the
Head
Start
preschool
program,
which
was
forced
to
reduce
enrollment
due
to
the
sequester.
The
additional
NIH
funding
is
an
important
step
toward
undoing
the
sequester&#8217;s
damage,
but
I
will
keep
fighting
to
ensure
Pennsylvania&#8217;s
medical
research
centers
have
the
most
robust
support
possible
to
continue
their
lifesaving
work.
Unfortunately
the
funding
agreement
did
not
include
an
extension
of
emergency
unemployment
benefits
for
1.5
million
Americans
and
their
families.
I
believe
it
is
inexcusable
that
the
Republican-led
House
adjourned
for
a
weeklong
break
without
passing
legislation
to
restore
this
assistance.
This
important
economic
lifeline
affects
more
than
80,000
Pennsylvanians
who
want
to
work
so
they
can
support
their
families,
pay
their
bills,
and
build
for
the
future
( Source ).
I
will
continue
urging
Republicans
to
join
Democrats
to
extend
unemployment
insurance
and
restore
security
for
millions
of
Americans
and
their
families.
I
encourage
you
to
visit
my
website
and
my
Facebook

for
more
information
about
my
work
on
these
important
issues.
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
represent
you
in
Congress.
