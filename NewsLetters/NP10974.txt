Dear Friend,
This month the President released his $3.9 trillion FY2015 Budget
Proposal. I believe this proposal raises taxes, creates new government
programs, makes indiscriminate cuts to the size and pay of the military
at a time when our country faces increasing global uncertainty and
instability, and fails to incorporate even modest reforms to our
looming entitlement crisis. The House Budget Committee is preparing to
release their budget and I am working to ensure it includes solutions
to the big spending problems facing our nation, such as entitlement
reforms, reducing our national debt, and responsibly cutting spending
to reduce the deficit.
To tackle some of the federal government's egregious spending, I
introduced the Shrink Our Spending (S.O.S.) Initiative. I have looked
for wasteful and duplicative programs in each area of government, and
will proceed to introduce new legislation to eliminate that program or
its funding each week we are in session. If we cannot break our
addiction to spending then we cannot begin to address our debt and
deficit.
Again ObamaCare was delayed this month, this time the individual
mandate. I made this prediction in October on Anderson Cooper and I
still believe this law is not workable. Click here
to
read a summary of all the ObamaCare delays. Additionally, a lot of
business owners are paying attention to the Hobby Lobby case that is
currently before the Supreme Court. It is my hope that religious
freedom will prevail.
In Arizona, I met with many of you at my town hall in Mesa, the field
hearing at the ASU Polytechnic Campus, and at my open office hours in
my district office. Talking directly with my constituents, regardless
of political belief, is very important to me. That is why I also hosted
a district-wide telephone town hall to speak with many of you that were
unable to attend my town hall.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of
service and be sure to sign up for my newsletter here
.
It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Updates from Washington, D.C.
Shrinking Our Spending Initiative
During my town hall in Mesa, I announced to over 200 of you my latest
legislative initiative to highlight and cut wasteful and duplicative
programs in every area of government. My Shrinking Our Spending
(S.O.S.) Initiative will make the hard spending cuts we refuse to make
in the areas of government we refuse to touch. Click here

Salmon Leads Letter Requesting More Customs Officers
I led an Arizona delegation letter to the Secretary of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson requesting that an additional 500 customs officers
be stationed at the Arizona ports of entry on our southern border. This
would strengthen our security and improve the annual flow of over $13
billion worth of trade.

Salmon Questions Secretary Kerry at Hearing
Secretary Kerry testified in front of the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs where I asked him to describe our strategy in the Western
Hemisphere. Secretary Kerry demonstrated the priorities of the State
Department when he responded by talking about the importance of paying
attention to climate change. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on the
Western Hemisphere, I convened a hearing shortly thereafter to
highlight the problem of U.S. disengagement from Latin America and how
it can compromise our national security and economic interests. Click

to view a photo of my
subcommittee hearing.
SNAP Verify Act
My SNAP Verify Act (H.R. 4006) fights rampant fraud in the system by
merely requiring a picture ID when using benefits. As reported by the
Arizona Republic, in Arizona there is an alleged case of millions of
dollars in SNAP fraud. With over $750 million in SNAP card and food
trafficking fraud each year, it is time for Congress to take action to
address the rampant waste in this federal program. My commonsense
reform will save taxpayers millions and ensure the program is available
to those in need.
Union Integrity Act
Labor Secretary Perez testified in front of the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce where I asked him if he would support
whistleblower protections for union employees (they are currently not
protected from retaliation when exposing corruption). He said that he
was interested in furthering the discussion. My legislation, H.R. 3637,
The Union Integrity Act, would protect those union employees brave
enough to shed light on union corruption. Read more here

Town Hall in Mesa
I hosted a town hall in Mesa at Broadway Christian Church this month.
There were lots of good questions, comments, and ideas from East Valley
residents. Be sure to sign up

town hall events. Click here

event.
Open Office Hours
On Saturday, March 15th, I hosted Open Office Hours at my district
office in downtown Gilbert where many of you scheduled time out of your
weekend to meet with me to share you legislative proposals, thoughts on
current legislation, and comments. I always appreciate input from my
constituents. Sign up
for my newsletter to learn about the next
Open Office Hours event.
Neighborhood Office Hours
My Arizona staff was at Redemption Church West Mesa and Tumbleweed
Recreation Center in Chandler this month for local neighborhood office
hours. They were able to help many of you sort out veterans' benefits
issues, assist in federal home loans, answer questions about social
security, and more. Check out my Facebook events page
for future neighborhood
office hours near your home.
Education and Workforce Field Hearing in Mesa
As a Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I
hosted a field hearing at ASU's Polytechnic Campus in Mesa to discuss
how we can revive our economy by supporting a 21st century workforce.
The presidents of the major Arizona universities and community
colleges, a representative from Intel, and other local leaders
testified of how Arizona is making good progress in preparing students
for our Arizona workforce, as well as areas where we can improve.
Chairman John Kline, Rep. Todd Rokita, and fellow AZ member Rep. Ral
Grijalva joined the hearing as well. Click here

Additional articles are included in my "Salmon in the News" section on
the right.
Constituent Spotlight
Former Mesa resident, Master Sergeant Manuel V. Mendoza, was awarded
the Medal of Honor (Posthumously) at a special White House ceremony on
March 18th, 2014. MSgt Mendoza was recognized for his actions on Mount
Battaglia, Italy, on Oct. 4, 1944. While serving as a platoon sergeant
with Company B, 350th Infantry, 88th Infantry Division, Mendoza
single-handedly broke up a German counterattack. He earned the
nicknamed "The Arizona Kid" for his combat heroism. I am glad to see
his valor recognized by his family receiving his well-deserved Medal of
Honor, and I was pleased to fly a flag over the U.S. Capitol in his
honor. Read more about his story here

Dear
Friend,
This
month
the President
released his
$3.9
trillion
FY2015
Budget
Proposal. I
believe
this
proposal
raises
taxes,
creates
new
government
programs,
makes
indiscriminate
cuts
to
the
size
and
pay
of
the
military
at
a
time
when
our
country
faces
increasing
global
uncertainty
and
instability,
and
fails
to
incorporate
even
modest
reforms
to
our
looming
entitlement
crisis.
The
House
Budget
Committee
is
preparing
to
release
their
budget
and
I
am
working
to
ensure
it
includes
solutions
to
the
big
spending
problems
facing
our
nation,
such
as
entitlement
reforms,
reducing
our
national
debt,
and
responsibly
cutting
spending
to
reduce
the
deficit.
To
tackle
some
of
the
federal
government&#8217;s
egregious
spending,
I
introduced
the
Shrink
Our
Spending
(S.O.S.)
Initiative.
I
have
looked
for
wasteful
and
duplicative
programs
in
each
area
of
government,
and
will
proceed
to
introduce
new
legislation
to
eliminate
that
program
or
its
funding
each
week
we
are
in
session. If
we
cannot
break
our
addiction
to
spending
then
we
cannot
begin
to
address
our
debt
and
deficit.
Again
ObamaCare
was
delayed
this
month,
this
time
the
individual
mandate.
I
made
this
prediction
in
October
on
Anderson
Cooper
and
I
still
believe
this
law
is
not
workable.
Click

to
read
a
summary
of
all
the
ObamaCare
delays. Additionally,
a
lot
of
business
owners
are
paying
attention
to
the
Hobby
Lobby
case
that
is
currently
before
the
Supreme
Court.
It
is
my
hope
that
religious
freedom
will
prevail.
In
Arizona,
I
met
with
many
of
you
at
my
town
hall
in
Mesa,
the
field
hearing
at
the
ASU
Polytechnic
Campus,
and
at
my
open
office
hours
in
my
district
office.
Talking
directly
with
my
constituents,
regardless
of
political
belief,
is
very
important
to
me.
That
is
why
I
also
hosted
a
district-wide
telephone
town
hall
to
speak
with
many
of
you
that
were
unable
to
attend
my
town
hall.
As

Field
Hearing

a
Member

House
Committee

Education
and
the

I
hosted
a

Polytechnic
Campus
in

to
discuss
how
we
can
revive
our

century
workforce.
The
presidents
of
the
major
Arizona
universities
and
community
colleges,
a
representative
from
Intel,
and
other
local
leaders
testified
of
how
Arizona
is
making
good
progress
in
preparing
students
for
our
Arizona
workforce,
as
well
as
areas
where
we
can
improve.
Chairman
John
Kline,
Rep.
Todd
Rokita,
and
fellow
AZ

Constituent
Spotlight
Former
Mesa
resident,
Master
Sergeant
Manuel
V.
Mendoza,
was
awarded
the
Medal
of
Honor
(Posthumously)
at
a
special
White
House
ceremony
on
March
18th,
2014.
MSgt
Mendoza
was
recognized
for
his
actions
on
Mount
Battaglia,
Italy,
on
Oct.
4,
1944.
While
serving
as
a
platoon
sergeant
with
Company
B,
350th
Infantry,
88th
Infantry
Division,
Mendoza
single-handedly
broke
up
a
German
counterattack.
He
earned
the
nicknamed
"The
Arizona
Kid"
for
his
combat
heroism.
I
am
glad
to
see
his
valor
recognized
by
his
family
receiving
his
well-deserved
Medal
of
Honor,
and
I
was
pleased
to
fly
a
flag
over
the
U.S.
Capitol
in
his
honor.
