Dear
Friends,
Here is a quick recap
of what happened last week in Congress.
Working to Trasfer Federal
Lands to Local Control
Last week, I launched the Federal Land Action
Group,
a
congressional team that will develop a legislative framework for
transferring public lands to local ownership and control. Read the article from
the Deseret News here:
www.deseretnews.com
The federal government
has been a lousy landlord for western states and we simply think the
states can do it better, Stewart said. If we want healthier forests,
better access to public lands, more consistent funding for public
education and more reliable energy development, it makes sense to have
local control.
Introduced a Bill to Prevent the Listing of the Greater
Sage-Grouse
This bill would allow states
to create and implement a state-specific conservation and management
plan that will successfully protect and restore greater sage-grouse
populations and their habitats. Also known as the Sage Grouse Protection
and Conservation Act, this bill would prevent its listing under the
Endangered Species Act which would help restore the greater sage-grouse
population.
Voted to Repeal the Estate Tax
The Estate Tax, also known as the death tax, prevents too many
families from passing down small businesses to the next generation. As a
former small business owner, I recognize the harm that this tax has on
family-owned businesses. My vote to repeal the Estate Tax, is a step
closer to removing this harmful tax and protecting family-owned
businesses.
Passed a
Balanced Budget
For the 1st time since 2001, the House passed a
joint-chamber balanced budget agreement. A Great step towards fiscal
sanity. Here are a few things to know about
it:
Balances the Federal Budget
within 10 years, without raising
taxes.
Helps create 1.2 million new jobs and
save taxpayers more than $5
trillion.
Makes our tax code simpler and
fairer.
Makes
it easier to repeal Obamacare
so that we can replace it with
reforms focused on lowering costs, protecting jobs, and str engthening the doctor-patient
relationship.
Ensures a strong national
defense.
Reins in red tape and excessive
regulations so that its easier to start and grow and
business.
Calls
on Congress to pass a balanced budget amendment so that fiscal
responsibility is locked in for our children and grand children.
