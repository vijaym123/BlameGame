Since 1998, the Department of Commerce has exercised control over the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private, non-profit organization that manages basic functions of the Internet.
Earlier this year, however, the Administration
announced
its intent to relinquish control of ICANN to the global Internet community.
In response, I sent a
letter
to Secretary of Commerce Pritzker to request important information about the Departments plans to relinquish United States oversight of the Internet. It is vitally important that we put policies in place that are in the best interest of the American people - a free Internet is one I will continue fighting to protect.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - During floor consideration of the annual funding bill for the Department of Justice ( H.R. 4660 ), I also supported an amendment to prohibit funding for the transfer of ICANN. The bill passed the House and is now awaiting action in the Senate.
