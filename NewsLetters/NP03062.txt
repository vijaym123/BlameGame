This week, I was honored to announce my subcommittee assignments for the 114th session of Congress. I will again serve on the committees on House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure, Foreign Affairs, and Homeland Security.
On Transportation and Infrastructure, Im assigned to the subcommittees on
Highways and Transit, Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials
and
Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management . On Foreign Affairs, I will serve on the subcommittees on
Asia and the Pacific
and
Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade . For Homeland Security, my assigned subcommittees are
Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies
and
Oversight and Management Efficiency .
As was announced earlier this month, I am also now the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. This Subcommittee oversees the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) day-to-day operations to ensure that its operating in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Each committee has outlined aggressive agendas for the 114th Congress. Transportation and Infrastructure, again chaired by neighboring Pennsylvania Congressman Bill Shuster, will focus on reauthorizing federal surface transportation, aviation, and passenger rail programs. Foreign Affairs, chaired by Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA), will seek to stop Irans march to nuclear weapons, sanction North Korea for cyber-attacks, combat ISIS and safeguard Israels right to security. Homeland Security, chaired by Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX), has identified international and domestic terrorism, cyber attacks, unsecured borders, and poor DHS management practices as key challenges to confront.
Whether ensuring that Pennsylvania and our Nation have a strong and safe transportation network to help promote economic growth, better protecting our citizens and our homeland against terrorism, or promoting a strategic and sensible foreign policy, these subcommittee assignments will help me to be a strong advocate for you.
In the coming days, I will introduce my first series of bills to advance common-sense solutions to control government spending, create more opportunities for Americans and reduce government regulation over families and small businesses.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
