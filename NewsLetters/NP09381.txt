On Memorial Day, we honor and remember those who made the ultimate
sacrifice in defense of the United States of America. The freedom,
liberty and security we enjoy would not exist without the courageous service
of our fallen brothers and sisters in arms. We also take this
opportunity to thank our veterans and service members for their willingness
to put their lives on the line to defend our country and our way of
life.
We must also never forget the enormous sacrifices of the
spouses and families of our service members
the time spent apart,
the strain of maintaining a household while your husband or wife is
stationed overseas, the fear that your loved one may never make it home.
From my family to yours, thank you.
We have a sacred
responsibility and moral obligation to uphold the commitments we made to our
veterans. I was infuriated by reports that American veterans died
after being placed on secret waiting lists by their local VA. This is
absolutely unacceptable. As a member of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, here are the actions I have taken to hold
the VA accountable for this scandal:
First, I wrote U.S.
Attorney General Eric Holder and
called for the
Department of Justice to work with state attorneys general and local
law enforcement to lead criminal investigations into those responsible
for the preventable deaths of American
veterans .
Second, I voted in favor of the VA Appropriations bill to find the
department for the next year, providing the VA with the resources it
needs to deliver the services our veterans earned, while
increasing Congressional oversight and instituting strict
reporting requirements .
Third, I voted for the
VA Management Accountability Act, HR
4031 , which would bring a new culture of accountability to the
VA by making it easier to fire senior VA employees for poor
performance. This bill makes clear to VA managers:
get
the job done, or make way for someone who
can .
Fourth, my office is continuing to work with local veterans to ensure
they receive the services, benefits and recognitions they deserve.
This is one of my highest priorities as your Congressman. If you or a
family member need assistance with the VA, please do not hesitate to
contact my
office .
I
appreciate your feedback.
You can also share your thoughts on my
website ,
Facebook page
or
Twitter account , and please
be sure to watch my latest floor speeches and interviews on my
Youtube page .
Sincerely,
Congressman Tom
Rooney
