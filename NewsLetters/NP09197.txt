Veterans Remembering Veterans
I was privileged to visit with World War II veterans Bruce Voges, Bob
Weaver, and Dan Seastrand (left to right in photo above) at a Memorial
Day weekend service in St. Joseph on May 23.
On Memorial Day itself, May 26, I spoke at services at the Oblong
Cemetery (right) and at the Highland VFW.
Power Plant Regulations Expected To Cost Consumers Billions Annually
Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century
Energy released a report forecasting that the Environmental Protection
Agency's plans to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants
will cost the U.S. economy more than $50 billion a year, eliminate
hundreds of thousands of jobs, and significantly raise energy prices
for American consumers and businesses.
The report, "Assessing the Impact of Potential New Carbon Regulations
in the United States,"
used information from the Natural Resources Defense
Council's regulatory proposal and the administration's announced
emissions reduction goals.
President Obama is expected to unveil the EPA's proposed regulations
for existing power plants Monday. In announcing the proposal, the
president is expected to promise global leadership on climate change,
but likely missing from his speech will be any acknowledgement of the
damaging economic impacts of his actions on America's middle-class
families and the nation's poor and unemployed.
The president will also surely dodge the fact that even his own
administration has acknowledged that it is "unlikely" any of the EPA's
rules would have a meaningful impact on the global climate.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been seeking answers
regarding the Obama Administration's climate change agenda, and has
promised to continue its robust oversight of the EPA.
