Small Business Workshop
In early November, I hosted a small business workshop to help connect
entrepreneurs with the resources they need to start or expand their
businesses. I brought in top experts from across the area to offer
their advice to the capacity crowd. The turnout shows a renewed
entrepreneurial spirit in our district.
At the workshop, entrepreneurs learned how to obtain capital and
develop a solid business plan, among other topics. Our experts offered
the latest information on micro-lending and other loans, grants, and
crowd funding. In addition, participants learned about marketing
through social media, websites, blogs, and advertisements. And
representatives from the State of Illinois offered helpful tips on how
to secure state and federal contracts.
I plan to host additional workshops, so please continue to visit my
website at http://www.robinkelly.house.gov
for the latest information. To download my Small Business
guidebook of resources for small business owners and entrepreneurs,

Second District Economic Development Tour
In November, I conducted my 2nd District Economic Development Tour.
Making stops in Chicago, Kankakee and throughout the South Suburbs, I
heard ideas from business owners on how I can support business growth
and job creation in the district. I want to highlight a few of the
businesses I visited on my first Economic Development Tour:
- Imperial Zinc, a family owned Chicago business, is the United States'
largest producer of zinc alloy. For many years, the company has offered
second-chance employment to ex-offenders. According to company
president Mark Spellman, the ex-offenders have turned out to be the
best workers.
During my visit, I learned the company's major concern is lack of
reliable internet service - which is problem throughout the South Side
of Chicago. I'm currently looking for ways to help improve internet
access to facilitate Imperial Zinc's expansion and attract new
businesses to the area.
- Landaur in Glenwood produces millions of radiation monitoring
devises worn by medical employees, nuclear power plant operators and
military personnel. The company recently developed a wristwatch-like
product used by soldiers to detect radiation in the combat fields.
Landaur is eager to expand and modernize its plants and I will do
whatever I can to support this initiative and protect our troops.
- Nucor Steel in Kankakee produces rebar (reinforcing bar) steel
rounds, flats, and angles. Nucor is a Fortune 300 company and one of
the largest steel producing companies in the world, providing a
necessary resource to a variety of industries. While visiting we
discussed the importance of improving our infrastructure to create jobs
update the many overdue infrastructure sites across the country.
- CSX in Riverdale is the largest freight railroad transportation
company east of the Mississippi. One in five of CSX's employees are
veterans and the company has been recognized by GI Jobs as one of the
top 10 places in the nation for veterans to work. While touring their
facility I learned about many of their local projects and programs they
have initiated to hire local and improve the community.
My primary goal as a Member of Congress is to provide more
opportunities for residents and businesses. The economic development
tour was part of my comprehensive plan to promote economic growth and
job creation in the 2nd District.
I encourage you to regularly check www.robinkelly.house.gov
to learn about economic development initiatives and future
projects that may benefit you or your neighborhood.
Congresswoman Kelly visiting Landaur and learning about docimeters.

Veterans Day in the Second District
On November 11th, we celebrated Veterans Day by honoring the brave men
and women who served in defense of our great nation. Their sacrifice
makes our freedoms possible so I spent much of that weekend visiting
with veterans across the district to thank them for their service. I
visited the Pullman War Monument, Thornton TownshipVeterans Day Benefit
Fair, and the American Legion in Hazel Crest. I also attended the
Lansing Veterans Memorial Honor guard event, honoring our women
veterans. The Second District has a proud history of service. Talking
with veteran constituents is one of the most rewarding parts of my job
and I relish the opportunity to hear their stories and learn how I can
best serve them.
To help ensure that veterans and recently returned service members have
as easy a transition into civilian life as possible, my office has put
together a veterans guidebook. In it, you will find information on
everything from veteran benefits to education, housing, and female
service member resources. To download my Veterans Guidebook, visit

Cleaning Up Pet Coke Mountains
Pet coke-short for petroleum coke-is a black, sandy byproduct of a
refinery in Whiting, Indiana. On windy days, clouds of black sand can
be seen blowing from the mounds into surrounding neighborhoods, coating
homes and cars. Pet Coke may have the potential to cause respiratory
issues for residents.
I recently co-sponsored a bill directing the federal government to
conduct a comprehensive study on the health and environmental impacts
of pet coke. I also sent a letter to the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency expressing my concerns with a permit application
submitted by KCBX to expand its pet coke operation. The IEPA denied the
permit on November 19. Additionally, the U.S. EPA ordered the two pet
coke storage facilities to install nine air quality monitors in nearby
neighborhoods.
I want to thank local, state and federal officials for acting quickly
to address the pet coke issue. I will continue working with them to
limit the amount of pet coke being stored by KCBX and another company,
Beemsterboer, until more is learned about the possible health and
environmental impacts. And I'm happy to report that, in recent weeks,
some of the pet coke has been removed.
I believe the health and safety of the community must always come first
and will continue to work to protect residents from the potential
hazards presented by pet coke.

12 Days of District
For a little holiday fun, I'm hosting a virtual district scavenger
hunt. From December 17th through December 28th, I will post on my
official Facebook and Twitter accounts a picture and clue of a district
landmark. To participate, take a picture of yourself at the same
location and post it on either Facebook or Twitter using the hashtag
#12DoD. A fun family activity, see if you can find them all!
Remember to like my Facebook page and follow me on Twitter to keep up
with the scavenger hunt as well as my office's programs and
initiatives.

News You Can Use: Preparing Your Home for Winter Weather
1. Seal drafty windows and doors: Spending a few dollars on
weatherizing doors and windows will help you save on energy costs and
is a wise investment to keep the cold out and heat in.
2. Change your air filter: Replace your air filter every 30-60 days to
make sure warm air has a clean path from the furnace to your vents.
3. Lower your water heater temperature: Set your water heater's
temperature to between 120 and 125 to save money.
4. Keep vents clear: Move furniture and rugs away from vents so warm
air can circulate freely.
5. Store window unit air conditioners: Leaving in-window units will
allow cool drafts to come inside.
6. Set your thermostat: If you can, program your thermostat to lower
the temperature when you are not going to be home for 8 hours or more.
7. Keep fireplace damper closed: When you are not using it, make sure
your fireplace is closed to keep cold air from leaking into your home.
8. Insulate your attic and basement: Having uninsulated attics and
basements makes it more difficult to keep your home warm.
9. Keep shades closed at night: Shades help insulate windows and help
keep your home warm.
10. Open sun-facing shades: When you open shades that face the sun, you
invite in natural heat that helps lower costs.

Letter
from
the
Congresswoman
Dear
Friends,
The
holiday
season
has
arrived!
With
it
comes
the
reminder
of
not
only
the
gifts
we
seek
but
the
gifts
we
have:
family
and
friends
that
are
the
true
richness
of
life.
In
the
coming
weeks,
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
spend
plenty
of
quality
time
with
those
you
hold
near
and
dear.
This
time
of
year
is
difficult
for
many
in
our
community
who
are
struggling
in
an
economy
that
has
yet
to
fully
rebound.
Many
families
are
having
trouble
meeting
their
basic
needs
for
food,
clothing
and
shelter.
I
am
working
hard
in
Congress
to
help
ease
the
economic
pressures
families
feel
and
to
protect
vital
government
programs,
such
as
the
SNAP
food
stamp
program,
that
are
important
safety
nets
for
families
working
to
get
back
on
their
feet.
There
are
many
wonderful
organizations
in
our
community
that
will
be
working
to
help
these
families
this
season.
Remember
that
charity
begins
at
home.
You
often
don&#8217;t
have
to
travel
too
far
outside
of
your
own
neighborhood
to
find
a
person
that
could
use
a
little
kindness.
Shopping
local
for
your
end
of
year
purchases
and
patronizing
the
many
great
little
shops
and
boutiques
in
the
2nd
District
helps
bring
money
back
into
the
community.
These
small
businesses,
run
by
our
friends
and
neighbors,
are
the
backbone
of
our
local
economy
and
a
driving
force
in
creating
local
jobs.
Spending
your
money
locally
is
a
great
way
to
find
a
unique
gift
while
giving
a
little
something
back
to
your
community.
It
is
an
honor
and
a
privilege
to
represent
the
2nd
District
of
Illinois.I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
work
with
you
in
the
coming
year
to
make
the
2nd
District
an
even
better
place
to
live
and
work.
I
wish
you
the
very
best
of
the
holiday
season
and
a
happy,
healthy
and
prosperous
new
year,
Robin

Small
Business
Workshop
In
early
November,
I
hosted
a
small
business
workshop
to
help
connect
entrepreneurs
with
the
resources
they
need
to
start
or
expand
their
businesses.
I
brought
in
top
experts
from
across
the
area
to
offer
their
advice
to
the
capacity
crowd.
The
turnout
shows
a renewed
entrepreneurial
spirit
in
our
district.
At
the
workshop,
entrepreneurs
learned
how
to
obtain
capital
and
develop
a
solid
business
plan,
among
other
topics.
Our
experts
offered
the
latest
information
on
micro-lending
and
other
loans,
grants,
and
crowd
funding.
In
addition,
participants
learned
about
marketing
through
social
media,
websites,
blogs,
and
advertisements.
And
representatives
from
the
State
of
Illinois
offered
helpful
tips
on
how
to
secure
state
and
federal
contracts.
I
plan
to
host
additional
workshops,
so
please
continue
to
visit
my
website
at
http://www.robinkelly.house.gov
for
the
latest
information.

Workshop
Second
District
Economic
Development
Tour
In
November,
I
conducted
my
2nd
District
Economic
Development
Tour.
Making
stops
in
Chicago,
Kankakee
and
throughout
the
South
Suburbs,
I
heard
ideas
from
business
owners
on
how
I
can
support
business
growth
and
job
creation
in
the
district.
I
want
to
highlight
a
few
of
the
businesses
I
visited
on
my
first
Economic
Development
Tour:
-
Imperial
Zinc ,
a
family
owned
Chicago
business, is
the
United
States&#8217;
largest
producer
of
zinc
alloy.
For
many
years,
the
company
has
offered
second-chance
employment
to
ex-offenders.
According
to
company
president
Mark
Spellman,
the
ex-offenders
have
turned
out
to
be
the
best
workers.
During
my
visit,
I
learned
the
company&#8217;s
major
concern
is
lack
of
reliable
internet
service
&#8211;
which
is
problem
throughout
the
South
Side
of
Chicago.
I&#8217;m
currently
looking
for
ways
to
help
improve
internet
access
to
facilitate
Imperial
Zinc&#8217;s
expansion
and
attract
new
businesses
to
the
area.
-
Landaur
in
Glenwood
produces
millions
of
radiation
monitoring
devises
worn
by
medical
employees,
nuclear
power
plant
operators
and
military
personnel.
The
company
recently
developed
a
wristwatch-like
product
used
by
soldiers
to
detect
radiation
in
the
combat
fields.
Landaur
is
eager
to
expand
and
modernize
its
plants
and
I
will
do
whatever
I
can
to
support
this
initiative
and
protect
our
troops.
-
Nucor
Steel
in
Kankakee
produces
rebar
(reinforcing
bar)
steel
rounds,
flats,
and
angles.
Nucor
is
a
Fortune
300
company
and
one
of
the
largest
steel
producing
companies
in
the
world,
providing
a
necessary
resource
to
a
variety
of
industries.
While
visiting
we
discussed
the
importance
of
improving
our
infrastructure
to
create
jobs
update
the
many
overdue
infrastructure
sites
across
the
country.
-
CSX
in
Riverdale
is
the
largest
freight
railroad
transportation
company

One

GI
Jobs
as
one
of
the
top
10
places
in
the
nation
for
veterans
to
work.
While
touring
their
facility
I
learned
about
many
of
their
local
projects
and
programs
they
have
initiated
to
hire
local
and
improve
the
community.
My
primary
goal
as
a
Member
of
Congress
is
to
provide
more
opportunities
for
residents
and
businesses.
The
economic
development
tour
was
part
of
my
comprehensive
plan
to
promote
economic
growth
and
job creation
in
the
2nd
District.
I
encourage
you
to
regularly
check
www.robinkelly.house.gov
to
learn
about
economic
development
initiatives
and
future
projects
that
may
benefit
you
or
your
neighborhood.

Veterans
Day
in
the
Second
District
On
November
11th,
we
celebrated
Veterans
Day
by
honoring
the
brave
men
and
women
who
served
in
defense
of
our
great
nation.
Their
sacrifice
makes
our
freedoms
possible
so
I
spent
much
of
that
weekend
visiting
with
veterans
across
the
district
to
thank
them
for
their
service.
I
visited
the
Pullman
War
Monument,
Thornton
TownshipVeterans
Day
Benefit
Fair,
and
the
American
Legion
in
Hazel
Crest.
I
also
attended
the
Lansing
Veterans
Memorial
Honor
guard
event,
honoring
our
women
veterans.
The
Second
District
has
a
proud
history
of
service.
Talking
with
veteran
constituents
is
one
of
the
most
rewarding
parts
of
my
job
and
I
relish
the
opportunity
to
hear
their
stories
and
learn
how
I
can
best
serve
them.
To
help
ensure
that
veterans
and
recently
returned
service
members
have
as
easy
a
transition
into
civilian
life
as
possible,
my
office
has
put
together
a
veterans
guidebook.
In
it,
you
will
find
information
on
everything
from
veteran
benefits
to
education,
housing,
and
female
service
member
resources.

Cleaning
Up
Pet
Coke
Mountains
Pet
coke&#8212;short
for
petroleum
coke&#8212;is
a
black,
sandy
byproduct
of
a
refinery
in
Whiting,
Indiana.
On
windy
days,
clouds
of
black
sand
can
be
seen
blowing
from
the
mounds
into
surrounding
neighborhoods,
coating
homes
and
cars.
Pet
Coke
may
have
the
potential
to cause respiratory issues
for
residents.
I
recently
co-sponsored
a
bill
directing
the
federal
government
to
conduct
a
comprehensive
study
on
the
health
and
environmental
impacts
of
pet
coke.
I
also
sent
a
letter
to
the
Illinois
Environmental
Protection
Agency
expressing
my
concerns
with
a
permit
application
submitted
by
KCBX
to
expand
its
pet
coke
operation.
The
IEPA
denied
the
permit
on
November
19.
Additionally,
the
U.S.
EPA
ordered
the
two
pet
coke
storage
facilities
to
install
nine
air
quality
monitors
in
nearby
neighborhoods.
I
want
to
thank
local,
state
and
federal
officials
for
acting
quickly
to
address
the
pet
coke
issue.
I
will
continue
working
with
them
to
limit
the
amount
of
pet
coke
being
stored
by KCBX
and
another
company,
Beemsterboer, until
more
is
learned
about
the
possible
health
and
environmental
impacts.
And
I&#8217;m
happy
to
report
that,
in
recent
weeks,
some
of
the
pet
coke
has
been
removed.
I
believe
the
health
and
safety
of
the
community
must
always
come
first
and
will
continue
to
work
to
protect
residents
from
the
potential
hazards
presented
by
pet
coke.
12
Days
of
District
For
a
little
holiday
fun,
I&#8217;m
hosting
a
virtual
district
scavenger
hunt. From
December
17th
through
December
28th,
I
will
post
on
my
official
Facebook
and
Twitter
accounts
a
picture
and
clue
of
a
district
landmark.
To
participate,
take
a
picture
of
yourself
at
the same
location
and
post
it
on
either
Facebook
or
Twitter
using
the
hashtag
#12DoD.
A
fun
family
activity,
see
if
you
can
find
them
all!
Remember
to
like
my
Facebook
page and
follow
me
on
Twitter
to
keep
up with
the
scavenger
hunt
as
well
as
my
office&#8217;s
programs
and
initiatives.

Home
for
Winter
Weather
1.
Seal
drafty
windows
and
doors :
Spending
a
few
dollars
on
weatherizing
doors
and
windows
will
help
you
save
on
energy
costs
and
is
a
wise
investment
to
keep
the
cold
out
and
heat
in. 2.
Change
your
air
filter :
Replace
your
air
filter
every
30-60
days
to
make
sure
warm
air
has
a
clean
path
from
the
furnace
to
your
vents. 3.
Lower
your
water
heater
temperature :
Set
your
water
heater&#8217;s
temperature
to
between
120&#186;
and
125&#186;
to
save
money. 4.
Keep
vents
clear :
Move
furniture
and
rugs
away
from
vents
so
warm
air
can
circulate
freely. 5.
Store
window
unit
air
conditioners :
Leaving
in-window
units will
allow
cool
drafts
to
come
inside. 6.
Set
your
thermostat :
If
you
can,
program
your
thermostat
to
lower
the
temperature
when
you
are
not
going
to
be
home
for
8
hours
or
more. 7.
Keep
fireplace
damper
closed :
When
you
are
not
using
it,
make
sure
your
fireplace
is
closed
to
keep
cold
air
from
leaking
into
your
home. 8.
Insulate
your
attic
and
basement :
Having
uninsulated
attics
and
basements
makes
it
more
difficult
to
keep
your
home
warm. 9.
Keep
shades
closed
at
night :
Shades
help
insulate
windows
and
help
keep
your
home
warm. 10.
Open
sun-facing
shades :
When
you
open
shades
that
face
the
sun,
you
invite
in
natural
heat
that
