Dear David,
Despite
gridlock in Congress, I am pleased to report that we got some important
things done for Nebraskans and all Americans during my first two years in
the United States Senate. This month, I released a digital booklet
entitled:
Working for You: A Look Back on My Work in
the 113 th
Congress,
which highlights my efforts to
represent Nebraska values in the Senate. I encourage you to review my
record by clicking on the image below.
As we look
to the New Year and the start of 114 th
Congress, I remain
committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
find solutions to the nations toughest
problems.
A PDF version of the book is
available
here.
Bruce
and I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas, blessed holiday
season, and a very happy New
Year!
Sincerely,
Deb Fischer
United States Senator
