Dear Friends,
I spent much of
last week meeting with Idaho business leaders, representing a broad
spectrum of our recovering economy. I spoke to the Boise Metro and Coeur
dAlene chambers of commerce, the Coeur dAlene Rotary Club and visited
individual businesses in the Treasure Valley and Kootenai
County.
While they reported improvement, great uncertainty remains.
Customer confidence is shaky. Companies rent equipment rather than buy,
while many entrepreneurs are forced to use credit cards to
borrow.
Growth requires predictability and stability.
Unfortunately, our federal government is at the root of much of the doubt thats
stifling long-term economic health.
The most important
steps we can take in Congress are on the fiscal front.
A
serious move to tackle our $18 trillion deficit by cutting government
spending would do wonders to restore confidence.
We also
should reform a Tax Code that kills jobs with its complexity and
arbitrarily picks winners and losers. I support a flat tax, with rates as low
as possible.
I also heard from businessmen and women about
regulations. Across our economy, resources are shifting from the
front lines where customers are served, relationships built and innovation
spurred. Sadly, jobs are moving to back offices where clerks,
accountants and lawyers fill out federal forms.
Those expenses
eat into profits and are passed on to consumers. Coupled with tax
reform, streamlined regulations and smaller government would repatriate
jobs to American shores.
Idaho business also needs to
compete in a global economy. Thats why I support free and fair trade and
immigration reforms that include a modern guest worker
program.
The economy has improved in significant part because Republicans
in Congress have worked to limit the growth of government. Annual
deficits are down from $1.4 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year to $486
billion in fiscal 2014. Im proud of helping make that
happen.
Much remains to be done, however. For many Americans the recovery
hasnt reached them, as they work multiple jobs to stay afloat. Far too
many hard-working Idahoans have been left out of American
Dream.
I consider it my duty as your congressman to do everything I
can to help restore hope for all Americans.
Thank you ,
