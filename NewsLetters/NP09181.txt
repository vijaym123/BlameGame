No Funding to
Attempt to Cap Greenhouse Gas Emissions
My
amendment to
H.R. 4660
passed the
House Thursday evening by a vote of 226-179. The amendment would prohibit
funds from being use to negotiate, or enter into, a trade deal that
includes provisions to limit greenhouse gas emissions. I offered the
amendment in response to efforts by the Obama Administration to attempt
to implement environmental policies through trade
agreements.
Our trade representatives should be singularly focused
on creating jobs and growing the economythey cant be negotiating
with two agendas. Additionally, including caps on carbon and greenhouse
gas emissions in trade agreements will give countries who choose not to
abide by such regulations, like China, an automatic upper
hand. You can read more about the amendment

Honoring Those Who Served
I'm so grateful for the men and women who selflessly served
our nation. Make sure you take the time to reach out your hand and say
"thank you" to a veteran for their service.

Remembering the Fallen
It was a great honor to lay a wreath in
remembrance of the fallen men and women who have bravely sacrificed to protect
our freedom. You can read more about the Memorial Day service

Marching Blackhawks, of Weaverville
They've been
invited to participate in the World War II 70 Anniversary
Commemoration, Pearl Harbor Memorial Parade. Theyre the first NC band to be
invited to participate in the ceremony. What an honor! This whole thing
seems like its kind of just out on its own. Is there a way to better
connect it with something?
Standing up to the
IRS
This week, I sent a letter to the IRS
Commissioner, along with Reps. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Brad Wenstrup (R-OH),
demanding that the agency completely abandon its attempts to stifle
our First Amendment rights. The letter calls on IRS Commissioner John
Koskinen to not introduce any further revised rules that would codify
into law the practice of political targeting. It also implores him to
address the massive backlog of 501(c)(4) applications. You can read more
about the joint letter
