Repealing The Death Tax
On
Thursday the House passed a full repeal of the Estate Tax, more
popularly and appropriately known as the Death Tax. I was fully
supportive of its repeal.
It makes absolutely no
sense for people to pay taxes on their earnings and property their
entire life, only to have their children pay additional taxes on the exact
same property when their parents pass away.
One ought not have
to pay the undertaker and the IRS on the same day.
That is why
the House has acted to ensure Washington does not treat the death of a
family member as an opportunity to take more out of the pockets of the
American people.
Creating a successful
business or a more secure life for future generations should not be
punished, but rather encouraged. Repealing this tax is a no-brainer.
Moreover, fundamental tax reform in order to make the code simpler and
fairer is a top priority in our efforts to provide more certainty, relief
and economic opportunity for all Americans.
Holding The
IRS To Account
On Wednesday the House
passed several measures aimed at holding the IRS accountable. These
measures were a needed response to a long-standing investigation of the
political targeting of American citizens.
As
we work to reform the tax code so that it is simpler and fairer, the
House has acted to help ensure that, at the very least, the agency
tasked with enforcing that code is held culpable for any
wrongdoing.
We must not forget that the IRS has
betrayed the trust of the American people by systematically targeting
certain folks for their political beliefs. These common sense measures
will provide much needed transparency and accountability
empowering
American citizens and protecting them from abuse, harassment and
targeting by bureaucrats. In the days and weeks to come, I look forward to
continuing the work toward fundamental tax reform so that we can
foster a healthier economy with less reliance on
Washington.
