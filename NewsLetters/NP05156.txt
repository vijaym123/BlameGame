Dear Friends,
As you may have heard,
Dr.Craig Spencer, who is a resident of Harlem has tested positive for
Ebola after returning home from West Africa where he traveled with
Doctors without Borders.
He is currently receiving treatment at the
Bellevue Hospital, which has been designated as one of the main
facilities to treat patients and is well trained in proper
protocols.
Rest assured that there is no need to be alarmed or to panic.
I have been in close communications with the Health and Human Services
and CDC, as well as Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, who have been
providing extraordinary leadership to ensure that the situation is
contained. New York City has one of the strongest public health systems
with the most advanced equipment and medical experts, and we are
certain that Dr. Spencer and any New Yorker will be
virus-free.
Please
note that Ebola is spread only by
directly touching the bodily fluids of an infected person. Ebola is not
spread through the air or by water
or simply by being near an
infected person.
As we pray for Dr. Spencer's swift
recovery, it is important that we share accurate information with our
family and friends to dispel any unnecessary concerns or
fears.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact my
congressional office. You can also follow me on
Twitter
(@cbrangel) for constant updates. Thank
you.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel

your friends &amp; family.
