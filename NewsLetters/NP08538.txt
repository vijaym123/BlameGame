Reducing Student Loan Debt
Dear Friend,
Higher education is one of the most important investments that young
people can make in their futures. Unfortunately, tuition costs have
been steadily increasing. In 2012, 70 percent of Pennsylvania's
students graduated with an average of over $31,675 in student loan
debt. (Source

Last week, President Obama announced
new and important executive actions to allow student
borrowers to better manage their student loan debt. He directed the
Department of Education to expand the Pay As You Earn Program to an
additional 5 million borrowers, which will enable them to cap their
student loan repayments at 10 percent of their income. This will
provide needed relief to young people seeking to start a family, buy a
home, start a business, or save for retirement.
US Rep. Schwartz introduces the Know Before You Owe Act with
students at Penn State Abington.
In addition, I am pleased that the President is moving ahead with
recommendations I made
to the Department of Education. These
include:
*	Outreach to at-risk borrowers so that they know that they have
flexible repayment options;
*	An outreach campaign that works with professional organizations;
*	Steps to ensure that the loan servicing contractors serve
students well.
And, the White House announced an effort to ensure that students and
families understand the higher education tax benefits available to them
to pay for college, including the American Opportunity Tax Credit
(AOTC). My College Affordability Act
, introduced in October 2013, called
for a taxpayer awareness initiative to improve awareness of the AOTC,
which provides families with up to $2,500 in relief.
The crushing burden of student loan debt is hurting our economy and
holding back a generation of young Americans. Now it is time for
Congress to take the next step forward. That is why I have cosponsored
the Bank on Students Emergency Refinancing Act to allow millions of
borrowers to refinance their existing student loans at lower interest
rates. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of the Know Before You Owe
Private Student Loan Act of 2013 to ensure that student borrowers have
the information they need to make smart decisions regarding their
student loan options.
We must ensure that a higher education is not just a luxury for the
few, but an opportunity for all. By expanding the educational
opportunities for every student, we will spur job growth, strengthen
our economy, and guarantee a bright future for our country.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
