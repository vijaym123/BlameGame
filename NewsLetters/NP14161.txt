Many Americans have expressed concerns about the implementation
of the President's health care law. I share many of those concerns and
think the cybersecurity questions surrounding the health care law are
especially troubling.
At a recent House Homeland Security Committee
hearing, I questioned Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials
about the procedures in place to prevent illegal immigrants from
signing up for the President's health care exchanges. The DHS officials
indicated that there is no mechanism in place to prevent someone who is
not eligible from participating in the President's health care
exchange. If the security safeguards are so lax that essentially anyone
can sign-up, how can we be sure that our private information is secure?
We must make cybersecurity of the healthcare website a top
priority. Verifying eligibility status for participants and protecting
individuals' personal information are common sense first steps.

If
