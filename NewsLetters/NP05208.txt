Here&rsquo;s the bad (okay, TERRIBLE) news:
A brand new poll shows Cheri&rsquo;s race against Bobby Schilling within a SINGLE-DIGIT. That means Republican groups will be falling over themselves to spend money against us. Here&rsquo;s the good (okay, AMAZING) news: A group of Cheri&rsquo;s supporters have agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS if we can reach 2OO donations by midnight.
David, the outcome of our race is at stake.
Please chip in for Cheri right now and help keep the Tea Party out of Illinois
-- for good.
48 to go -- are you in?
