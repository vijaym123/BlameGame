Shares Words of Congratulations and Encouragement with Virgin Islands Graduates

She said:
At Eudora Kean High
You not only have proven yourselves academically and in many extracurricular areas, but you have faced dreams deferred and yet picked yourselves up, started from scratch and built your aquaponics farm up again.
At Charlotte Amalie High
(Your diploma) It is your passport to the future you have prepared yourself for, the future of your dreams.
At Career and Technical Education Center
Beyond high school academics, each of you made a conscious decision and a conscious determination to learn a particular technical skill and become certified.
Whatever you do from here
whether you continue to improve on that skill at a technical school, go to college, go to work or open your own business, you are prepared and are an inspiration to others.
At Central High
I know the trials, and the obstacles you have had to overcome to get here this evening. It is through facing adversities that I have come to see how strong you are, how compassionate you are, how resilient you are, you see, I always knew you were ingenious!
At St. Croix Educational Complex
Graduates of 2014, I salute each and everyone of you on a job well done! You have come to this time in your lives in a world brimming with change. That world is yours. You are at the center of it! Reach out and grab it, be a part of it!
learn from it so that you can achieve your dreams, and
help us to rebuild a better St Croix, Virgin Islands and world! (prepared, not delivered)
Omnibus Territories Act Passes Senate With Energy Provisions for the Virgin Islands
Congresswoman Christensen announced that the Omnibus Territories Act S.1237 passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent earlier this week with three important provisions for the U.S. Virgin Islands.I am pleased that two of my energy provisions, one to direct the Secretary of Interior to develop an energy action plan for the Virgin Islands and another to increase the number of households that qualify for assistance under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 were a part of the measure, Congresswoman Christensen said. Another provision, directs the General Accountability Office to report to Congress on whether the annual estimates or forecasts of revenue and expenditure of the territories are reasonable and to make recommendations for improving the process for developing estimates and forecasts.
Congresswoman Christensen expressed disappointment that the Senate removed a provision that would raised the amount of matching funds that territories could waive from $200,000 to $500,000.
All of the territories would have benefitted from this, and I am dismayed that Senators did not see the value in the approval of this helpful measure, she said. Language to establish a St. Croix National Heritage Area and a Chief Financial Officer for the territory were dropped from the bill earlier because they could not garner bipartisan support.
The bill has to be approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed by the President before it becomes law.
GAO Report Shows More Coast Guard Assets Now Deployed to Caribbean
The General Accounting Office report requested by Congresswoman Christensen to analyze whether or not the Coast Guard was deploying sufficient assets to the Virgin Islands was released on Monday.
The report, which was also requested by Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi and Congressmen Nick Rahall and John Mica confirmed that the Coast Guard had not met its performance targets for several years, but is now in the process of adding new resources to step up the battle against crime and drugs in the Caribbean region.
The report confirms that through persistent pressure from its congressional representatives, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico has gotten the attention of the officials at the Department of Homeland Security and has increased vessel and aircraft operations for drug interdiction effortsby reallocating resources from elsewhere in the Coast Guard, Congresswoman Christensen said. We have insisted that there be a Caribbean Border Strategy to equal what is done on the Southwest Border and I am pleased that there has been significant movement to get us there, she said. The GAO report contains important information that can be used as the strategy is developed. The report summary states that in support of a Department of Homeland Security effortbeginning in 2012, the Coast Guard implemented a surge operation to provide additional vessels and aircraft to regularly patrol Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It continues that the increased vessel and aircraft deployments have since become the new baseline level of resources to be provided for drug interdiction operations there.
According to the report, Coast Guard data shows that drug interdiction operations in for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico more than tripled from FY 2009 to FY 2013.
It add that the number of maritime patrol aircraft hours spent conducting drug interdiction operations in the territories increased from 150 flight hours in FY 2011 to 1,000 flight hours in FY 2013.
Congresswoman Christensen was briefed by GAO on their findings in May prior to the release of the report. She also met with High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) task force in Puerto Rico in May where she was told about renovation going on in Puerto Rico to house new cutters.

Christensen Keynotes Transportation Symposium on St. Thomas
[DSC00233.JPG]
Congresswoman Christensen gave the keynote address at the Third Research to Practice Symposium on the Implementation of EDC Initiatives in the Virgin Islands on St. Thomas on Tuesday.
The symposium was a joint presentation of the Virgin Islands Department of Public Works and the Puerto Rico Transportation Technology Transfer Center (PR LTAP).
The symposium which tackles technical issues in transportation technology ran for three days.
The implementation of the Every Day Counts (EDC) transportation initiatives in the Virgin Islands is a critically important component as we move forward with the implementation of an integrated transportation system to serve the needs of the USVI community, said Congresswoman Christensen.
The mission of the PR/VI LTAPis to foster a safe, efficient and environmentally sound surface transportation system by improving skills and increasing knowledge of the transportation workforce and decision makers.
She thanked organizers for giving her the opportunity to learn more about tried and true techniques that will inform her thinking on what is needed to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians on Virgin Islands roads.
She congratulated VI DPW Commissioner Darryl Smalls on acquiring two new 84 foot ferries and new buses to replace VITRANs aging fleet.
The buses and ferries now in place were all funded by grants from the Federal Highway Administration which we worked with territorial officials to have authorized under SAFEA-LU funding in 2005, she said.
Tuesdays program focused on three aspects of the Every Day Counts II initiatives aimed at identifying and deploying the latest technologic innovation aimed at shortening project delivery, enhancing the safety of roadways and protecting the environment.
Surfaces, intersections and traffic incident management were discussed.
I have taken a look at some of the Virgin Islands traffic accident statistics and I am impressed that since 2012 we have seen a reduction in total crashes, injuries and fatalities over the past 2 and a half years, Congresswoman Christensen said.
Noting that vehicular fatalities seem to be on the rise, she said that the goal of the symposium to utilize the best traffic management research and translating it into practice in the territory is timely and important to saving lives and improving the quality of life for those of us who live here and also for our visitors. Congresswoman Christensen said that over her tenure, working with three successive governors, she was able to significantly increase federal highway funding for the territory. Beginning with my first year in Congress, we were able to secure a total of $85 million to include $6 million each for the Christiansted bypass and the St. Thomas Waterfront project. In 2005, we received more than $124 million in additional funding over six years including $8 million for Phase II of the Christiansted Bypass and $8 million for the East West Corridor on St. Thomas. Shee said that the territory is currently operating under the 2012 reauthorization which provides the Virgin Islands with $16 million annually.
There is currently a major push underway to pass a long-term four or five year Federal Highway Reauthorization bill this year, but the outlook is less than optimistic.
