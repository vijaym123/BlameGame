Securing Senior Care through Bipartisan Medicare Reforms
Recently the House took a solid step toward ensuring seniors access to care. I am proud that both parties were able to come together and pass common-sense Medicare reform that secures access to the 117,143 seniors age 65 and older in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes.
With my Rural Hospitals Access Act as a component of this bill, seniors can rest assure that funding is secured for Medicare Dependent and Low-Volume hospitals. This is a big step toward protecting rural resident&rsquo;s access to care. Washington came together for our seniors, and I am proud to have been a leader in passing these bipartisan Medicare reforms.
Reed highlights Dems Fractures on Fracking
Recently I spotlighted how the Obama Administration and the Cuomo Administration were at odds over natural gas development. I am calling on Gov. Cuomo to reverse his ill-conceived fracking ban that infringes on constitutionally protected property rights. If the Obama administration and even California Gov. Jerry Brown can side with farmers and landowners, now is the time to undo such a damaging and job-killing policy.
Recently I met with representatives from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to discuss type 1 diabetes.
I am impressed with recent developments to improve continuous monitoring systems, including a new app that sends blood glucose information directly to a user's smartphone. These technological advances are an encouraging sign that we are getting closer to developing a cure for type 1 diabetes.

Susan B. Anthony played a critical role in the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement. As a staunch advocate of social equality, she fought for women&rsquo;s rights and the abolition of slavery.
In 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester. This act of defiance rallied support for the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement and compelled passage of the 19th Amendment.
