The
President's Healthcare Law Continues to
Cost Americans More
Dear Friend,
Insurance rates for 2015, the second
year since the implementation of the
presidents healthcare law, are
projected to increase more than 8 percent
according to
a
report
released Tuesday by
PricewaterhouseCoopers. In Virginia, the
average monthly premium rate will be $351,
a whopping 11.3 percent increase from last
year. Nationwide, Americans will be paying
an average $385 monthly premium, and in
some states, the premiums are set to
increase 50 percent.
American families have already been
subject to substantial rate increases
triggered by the new mandates the law
imposes. Last year, one family in Franklin
County saw its premium double from $600 to
$1,200. Another Fifth District family in
Danville saw its deductible go from $500 to
$1,750. At a time when Americans are paying
more everywhere from the grocery store to
the gas pump, they should not be forced to
pay even more for their health insurance
because of the presidents flawed
law.
These staggering rate increases are just
another facet of the presidents
broken healthcare law that negatively
impact American families. We have already
seen cancelled policies, loss of access to
current physicians and providers, an online
marketplace system that is vulnerable to
data breach, reduced working hours, and
lost jobs. The cost of developing the
federal online marketplace cost
over
$840 million in taxpayer funds
because
of poor planning and management. This
squandering of taxpayer resources is simply
unacceptable, and American taxpayers are
paying an enormous price in multiple ways
because of the flaws in this harmful
law.
As I travel throughout our district, I
consistently hear about the laws
devastating effects on our families, like
the ones in Franklin County and Danville,
our workforce, and our struggling economy.
President Obama sold his signature
healthcare law to the American people on
the basis of false promises. He said he
would lower premiums, but they are higher
and will continue to rise. He told us we
could keep our current health plans and
keep seeing the doctors we know and trust,
but that too proved incorrect. The American
people are frustrated by the realities of
life under the ACA as indicated in a
survey
released this week by the Kaiser Family
Foundation, which found that 53 percent of
the American public had a unfavorable view
of the Affordable Healthcare Act, the
highest level of opposition recorded since
the law's passage in 2010.
I share in the frustration and concerns
of Fifth District Virginians with the
president's healthcare law. Virginians and
Americans deserve healthcare alternatives
that provide quality and affordable care
without unnecessary mandates that drive up
costs and reduce choice. That is why House
Republicans are focusing on solutions that
are patient-centered and market-based,
putting the power in the hands of
individuals and families, not the federal
government, to make healthcare decisions on
behalf of themselves and their families. I
look forward to continuing to work with my
colleagues to achieve meaningful healthcare
reform that works for the American people
and our economy.
