Removing
Government-Created Obstacles to Small
Business Jobs
Dear Friend,
As I traveled across the Fifth District
last week, I spoke with many business
leaders throughout Central and Southside
Virginia about ways to promote a pro-growth
agenda that will stimulate our economy and
provide new job opportunities for
hard-working Fifth District Virginians. The
overarching theme of so many of the
conversations was that government red tape
and overregulation are hurting our small
businesses and stifling their ability to
grow and create jobs.
I was particularly concerned by the
sentiment expressed by so many small
business owners and family farmers that the
government is not only their primary
obstacle to success, but it is actually
taking actions that harm jobs and the
economy. Overreaching regulations are
causing a lack of access to capital,
unstable energy prices, and uncertainty
regarding health care costs.
I heard about how the excessive
regulation of utilities is driving up costs
for energy-intensive businesses like
manufacturing and agriculture. The
presidents healthcare law is also
piling on additional costs that are
hampering the ability of small businesses
to create jobs for our stagnant economy. It
is forcing these vital employers to cut
employee hours and trim their workforces at
a time when we cannot afford to be doing
so. Business owners and farmers also told
me that their lack of access to capital is
hampering their success. A healthy economy
should provide numerous avenues for capital
formation for businesses and farms, but
excessively burdensome regulations like
those put forth by the Dodd-Frank Act are
preventing these businesses from obtaining
the capital they need to invest in their
enterprises and create jobs.
With the unemployment rate in many
Central and Southside Virginia localities
still exceeding the national rate,
government-created obstacles to economic
growth are unacceptable. Freeing our Main
Street businesses and family farms from the
burdens of unnecessary government
regulations continues to be a top priority,
and I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues in this effort so that
we may allow these small businesses and
family farms to create much-needed jobs and
stimulate economic growth.
