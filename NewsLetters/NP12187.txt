Neighbor,
Here in the South Puget Sound, we're fortunate to live and work with so
many veterans, servicemembers, and military family members. Our country
needs to do a better job supporting them and showing them our gratitude
for their sacrifices.
VALENTINES FOR VETERANS
In early February, I launched my second annual Valentines for Veterans
Drive. Students and families in the South Sound were invited to make
cards for local veterans thanking them for their service. I stopped by
Dower Elementary in Lakewood to do my part.
Congressman Heck made Valentines for Veterans with students at Dower
Elementary in Lakewood. He also spoke with them about his work in
Congress supporting veterans.
The goal for this year's drive was 2000 cards. We got more than 3000.
The cards were delivered by my office on Valentine's Day to Madigan
Army Medical Center, the VA Puget Sound, the VFW, and other places
around Washington state.
Thanks to everyone who participated. I'm already looking forward to
next year!
SERVICEMEMBERS OPPORTUNITY ACT
I have the honor of representing tens of thousands of active duty
servicemembers stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I believe all of
them deserve the opportunity to afford college, own a home, and serve
our country without worrying about runaway interest rates on their
loans and mortgages.
That's why I introduced the Servicemembers Opportunity Act this month.
This bill ensures all servicemembers can utilize the financial
protections they've earned under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a
2003 law which caps interest rates at 6% for obligations servicemembers
entered into before beginning their service.
You can find out more about this bill on my website.
MILITARY COLAS
Last week, the U.S. House voted 326-90 to stop the upcoming cut to
military retirement cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). I voted yes.
Veterans deserve to get the retirement benefits they've earned. This is
a common-sense fix to the December budget deal.
As always, please let me know your thoughts on any issue Congress is
considering. Your messages help shape the decisions I make.
Sincerely,
Denny Heck, Member of Congress
