BREAKING: KOCH PAC writes massive check to Bobby Schilling
David --
We just found out that ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling accepted a massive check from the Koch brothers&rsquo; business PAC.
But there&rsquo;s more: Boehner's campaign followed suit and cut Schilling a big check of its own.
We always knew Boehner and the Kochs would swoop in to save their handpicked candidate, but we didn&rsquo;t realize it would happen so early.
In 2012, Boehner&rsquo;s political arm spent $2.2 million attacking Cheri. Now, it looks like he&rsquo;s finally trying to get a return on his investment.
David, Cheri needs your help. She&rsquo;s working day and night to get her message out to Illinois voters, but her success will depend on our grassroots team -- it&rsquo;s the only way we can take on the Kochs. RAPID RESPONSE: Will you chip in $5 or more to help Cheri fight back against Boehner and the Kochs?

We always knew Bobby Schilling&rsquo;s &ldquo;re-brand&rdquo; as a moderate wasn&rsquo;t to be believed. While he was in office, he walked out on Illinois workers, voted for Paul Ryan&rsquo;s extreme budget (twice!), and signed his name next to Todd Akin&rsquo;s on a radical bill to redefine rape.
It&rsquo;s safe to say Cheri&rsquo;s working on an agenda just the opposite of Schilling&rsquo;s.
Let&rsquo;s make sure we help Cheri build the campaign she&rsquo;ll need to win so she can keep fighting for Illinois. Chip in for Cheri:
