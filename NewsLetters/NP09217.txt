Honoring Their Ultimate Sacrifice: Memorial Day
This weekend was filled with Memorial Day ceremonies throughout the 7th
district, and I am once again so proud to live in a community that
commits itself to honoring our heroes.
This year I joined my neighbors
at the City of Cumming Memorial Day Ceremony
and the Gwinnett County
Memorial Day Ceremony
where we celebrated the lives and memorialized the
sacrifices of our brave men and women who have died in the line of duty
serving our nation and protecting our freedoms here and abroad.
Certainly, many American families made time for bar-b-ques, graduation
ceremonies, and pool parties as Memorial Day kicks-off the summer
season, but it warms my heart to see how this district prioritizes the
true meaning of this day

Defense Authorization Bill Gets Overwhelming House Support
The National Defense Authorization Act
passed the House by
a bipartisan vote of 325-98 last week, and I'm happy to say that from
my position on the House Rules Committee, I was able to work with
Georgia's National Guard leaders to ensure that the Georgia's Guard
interests were protected.
>From troop pay to military readiness to how we can make the Department
of Defense work more efficiently, no stone was left unturned as we
discussed and debated how we can maintain our nation's fighting forces
as the best in the world.
I hope you are as proud as I am of how both
sides came together to have an open and transparent dialogue about all
the issues our military men and women face.

Water Resources Reform and Development Act One Step Away From President
Obama's Desk
Following six months of negotiations to work out the differences
between the House and Senate versions of the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA), the bill was passed by the House by a near
unanimous vote of 417-3.
Now it awaits one final vote in the Senate
before it goes to the President for his signature. This is a good bill
for Americans in all parts of the world and it is proof that there are
items out there that we can indeed find enough common ground on that we
can move forward.
I look forward to working towards more of these
kinds of agreements.
As I have shared with you in the past, WRRDA provides the final
necessary authorization for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project to
move forward. While that is incredibly valuable for everyone in this
state, Georgia did once again come under fire from Alabama and Florida
regarding water access.
Despite their efforts to claim our water in
the courts for decades, Georgia has been given the green light to move
forward with the Army Corps of Engineers in the creation of a new water
control manual with updated water withdrawal limits.
In a last ditch
effort, however, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions tried to used WRRDA to
stymie that progress and legislate this Tri-State water negotiation
from the Federal level.
The Georgia delegation immediately went to
work to protect Lake Lanier's water supply and passed a bill in the
House void of the Sessions language and a conference report that
ensured the States would continue their work to find a healthy
partnership for all three stakeholders.
To ensure clarity for everyone
as we move forward, I asked Chairman Shuster to join me and several of
my colleagues in a discussion to clarify that the bill bolsters
Georgia's efforts to ensure an abundant water supply for the residents
of the Seventh District for years to come, which you can watch here.
IRS Responds to the Voice of Congress and the American People
It appears that the voices of the more than 150,000 Americans who
weighed in on the IRS's proposal to change the rules governing
501(c)(4) organizations were heard loud and clear by the Obama
Administration last week.
While the House passed legislation that
would have delayed the implementation of a final rule that could have
had chilling effects on our Constitutional free speech rights, Senator
Harry Reid (D-NV) has refused to allow that bill to move to the
President's desk.
Thankfully, the IRS announced last Thursday that it
will not move forward with the proposed rule changes at this time.
I
will continue working with my colleagues to ensure that we get to the
bottom of the IRS scandal and that any new rules do not limit
individuals' free speech.

House Votes to Reform the NSA Bulk Phone Data Collection Program
Last Thursday, I joined over 300 of my colleagues in sending H.R. 3361,
the "USA FREEDOM Act
" to
the Senate.
The bill ends the practice of bulk phone data collection
by the government.
The simple truth is that every bill I vote on
regarding the national intelligence community alters the balance
between security and freedom, and last week I was happy to vote in
favor of one that turns the dial in favor of freedom.
While there is
no doubt more work to be done to protect our Constitutional rights, the
USA FREEDOM Act is a great step in the right direction and represents a
win for the American people.

Woodall and John Lewis Work Together to Support Autism Research
Too often, the American people think Congress is a place for partisan
squabbles.
Last week, however, I joined four of my Republican
colleagues and seven of my Democrat colleagues in sending this letter
to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
asking that it provide us data about how we are spending taxpayer
dollars on autism research and how we can do a better job promoting
those cutting-edge technologies -- like the ones being developed at the
Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta -- to diagnose and treat autism in
babies as young as 6 months old. The Oversight Committee, of which I am
a member, held a hearing of federal autism activities this week as
well, and I took advantage of that opportunity to shine a light on our
community's important work.
Coming together for a cause greater than politics really is easy to do
when it means supporting families struggling with autism.

Congress Works to Stop Human Trafficking
Last week my colleagues and I took a collective stand against a growing
problem in our nation: human trafficking.
On Wednesday, the House
passed five anti-human trafficking bills
by an overwhelming majority, and I
believe they go a long way towards cracking down on the criminals
responsible for this heinous crime and providing much needed support
for victims, and those at high risk of becoming victims, of human
trafficking.
We all have a responsibility to protect those who cannot
protect themselves, and I was proud to voice the Seventh District's
support this week for legislative efforts to do just that.
The Week Ahead
This week the House will vote on the "FY15 Commerce, Justice, Science
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
" Last week, the House Rules Committee, on which
I sit, cleared the way for this bill to be brought to the floor under
an Open Rule. An Open Rule means that any member of the House who
wishes to offer an amendment to the bill may come to the House floor
and do so. Because of this openness, we should have a robust, fruitful,
and bipartisan debate on the merits of a bill that was approved
unanimously by the House Appropriations Committee.
When Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) committed to making this House open
and transparent, Open Rules and robust amendment debates were the very
thing that he was talking about. This is truly a proud day for our
Republic and for the leadership of this House of Representatives.
The House will also consider the H.R. 4681, the "Intelligence
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015
."
This bill authorizes the activities of our
nation's intelligence gathering agencies, and I expect that it will
elicit an exciting debate on the House floor.

Member of Congress
