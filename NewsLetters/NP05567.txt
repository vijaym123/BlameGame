EVERYONE is talking about this:
"Obama has emerged as one of the most
consequential
and, yes,
successful
presidents in American history." -- Paul Krugman
Krugman is RIGHT. From signing the Affordable Care Act to ending the Bush tax cuts for the top 1%, President Obama has fought for progressive change against unprecedented Republican obstruction.
We&rsquo;re so proud to call Barack Obama our President.
But the last two years of this historic presidency are in real danger. We&rsquo;ve already seen the Republicans sue the President. We&rsquo;ve already heard the impeachment threats. Now, the Republicans are threatening to win their largest majority in a generation. And their first order of business? They&rsquo;re threatening to shut down the government AGAIN to derail Obamacare.
Simply put, if Republicans win an unstoppable majority, it will be a complete disaster.
We have 3 days to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen.
There isn&rsquo;t much time, the final federal fundraising deadline of the election is in 72 hours.
If you believe in President Obama&hellip; if you&rsquo;re still fighting alongside President Obama for progressive change&hellip; we need you to stand with us one last time.
