Dear Friends,
The 2014 Sochi Olympic games hold their opening ceremonies today.
Over
the last few weeks I have been focused on the security situation around
these games, which some 15,000 Americans are expected to attend.
Cooperation between the Russians and American officials has been mostly
strong, however, the intelligence-sharing by the Russians must improve
as the games progress.
After visiting Sochi and witnessing the
preparations, I am encouraged that over the next two weeks the security
in place will prevent a disruption of the games and like all Americans,
I'll be cheering on our athletes to bring home the gold.
I've written
and op-ed that appeared in the Austin American Statesman about the
security in Sochi.

Legislative Update
This week the Committee on Homeland Security, which I chair,
unanimously passed bipartisan legislation to bolster our nation's
cybersecurity, the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure
Protection (NCCIP) Act of 2013, HR 3696
. This bill will address the cyber threat by giving the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the tools to secure our nation in
cyberspace while protecting privacy and civil liberties while
prohibiting new regulations at DHS.
I also cosponsored the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards
(CFATS) Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014, HR 4007
. This bill authorizes the CFATS program and improves security
standards for high-risk chemical facilities, with the ultimate goal of
ensuring terrorists cannot access large quantities of chemicals that
could be used as weapons of mass destruction.
Last year, the tragic
explosion at the West, Texas fertilizer plant highlighted the problem
of the thousands of chemical facilities that are off the grid and
unknown to security inspectors.
CFATS has the vital mission to ensure
these facilities are secure from those looking to exploit potential
security flaws.
The House of Representatives also passed the Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement Act, HR 3590
. This bill
supports access for hunting or fishing on public lands, supports
recreational shooting and protects Second Amendment rights.
It also
protects the use of traditional ammunition and fish tackle while
eliminating government red tape.
I was proud to support this bill and
the important steps it takes for the historic rights and continued
tradition of fishing and hunting in Texas and across America.

Michael T. McCaul
