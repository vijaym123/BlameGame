Expanding
American Opportunity in 2014
Dear Friend,
Last week, America watched as President
Barack Obama delivered his annual State of
the Union address to a joint session of
Congress. I entered the House chamber
Tuesday night with a strong sense of hope
that our President would provide a
blueprint for getting our fiscal house in
order and growing our economy; instead, it
was much of the same empty rhetoric we have
heard in the past. While I welcome the
Presidents emphasis on economic
growth, job creation, and greater
opportunity for all Americans, I
respectfully disagree with much of his
approach for achieving these important
goals.
This Administration has pursued the same
government-knows-best type of
policies for five years, and the results
speak for themselves. Far too many Fifth
District Virginians and Americans are
unemployed, millions more are only working
part-time when they wish to work full-time,
and the percentage of able-bodied Americans
that have given up looking for work is at
its highest level in more than 30 years. We
as a nation are facing a debt of over $17
trillion with trillions of dollars more in
unfunded liabilities. The health insurance
plans of over five million Americans have
been canceled due to the Presidents
health care law.
Now the President is calling for a
year of action where he will
circumvent Congress and act unilaterally to
implement more of these types of policies
and regulations. I agree that action is
needed; that is why we in the House of
Representatives continue to pass
legislation that focuses on job creation,
economic growth, and reforming government
programs to eliminate wasteful spending.
Over the past year, my colleagues in the
House and I have put forth dozens of bills
aimed at jumpstarting our economy and
putting people back to work. The President
could have begun this year of
action by supporting any of the
dozens of House job-creation bills awaiting
action in the Senate.
The President missed an opportunity to
find common ground where the House, Senate,
and Executive can work together to pursue
these goals. It is my hope that the
President will work with the Congress to
generate greater opportunities for all
Americans to succeed.
