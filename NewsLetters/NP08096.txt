Senator Cruz and Congressman Lamborn Partner on Legislation to Hold
Terrorists Accountable
7/9/14
This evening,
Congressman Doug Lamborn partnered with Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) on legislation
to offer a reward of up to $5 million for information on or the capture
of the Hamas terrorists who kidnapped and murdered Naftali Fraenkel,
an Israeli-U.S. citizen, on June 12, 2014. Naftali was one of three
Jewish teens who was killed by Hamas terrorists, along with Gil-Ad Shaer
and Eyal Yifra. Congressman Lamborn was joined in filing the House
version of Senator Cruz's bill by his Democratic colleague, Congressman
Brad Sherman (CA-30).
The Israeli governments aggressive action against both the
kidnappers and Hamas is a just and appropriate action to both bring the
terrorists responsible to justice, and to degrade their capability to
launch further attacks. No one doubts Israels ability to carry out this
mission, but given Naftalis citizenship, I believe the United States
should demonstrate our clear support for Israel by offering a reward as
we traditionally have in terrorist attacks involving Americans. This
support should be understood in the context of our partnership with the
nation of Israel in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism,
which is our fight as well. Im proud to work with Congressman Lamborn on
this legislation.

Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)
"It is
an honor to once again partner with Sen. Cruz on anti-terrorism
legislation. This bill will require the Secretary of State to use the
Rewards for Justice program to offer a five million dollar reward for
information that leads to the capture of the terrorists responsible for the
death an American citizen, ensuring that they will never again be
allowed to murder innocent teenagers. The silence from the Obama
Administration is truly appalling. Doing nothing in the face of such a heinous
action is not an option.
Thats why Senator Cruz, Congressman
Sherman,
and I are working on moving this solution forward in a
bipartisan manner.
