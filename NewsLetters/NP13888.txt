Tell Me What You Think
Please take this short survey below and tell me what you think. Your
feedback, thoughts, and ideas help me better serve you.
_____
As you've probably heard, strong disagreements between House
Republicans, Senate Democrats, and President Obama have arisen
regarding the spending policies of the federal government.
A bi-partisan group of House and Senate members are currently engaged
in budget negotiations to resolve this impasse; their report is due in
mid-December. As this process moves forward, I'd like to know what you
think about the course of action you think Congress should take on
addressing America's $17 trillion national debt and other budget issues.
( )
Continue the
status quo. Both parties should stand their ground, with Republicans
opposing any tax increases and Democrats opposing any significant
spending reforms, despite the long term risks of our growing federal
debt and deficit.
( )
Cut Spending.
Both sides should sit down seek to produce a reasonable solution that
funds government, while achieving meaningful spending reforms that put
America on a more sustainable fiscal path.
( )
Raise Taxes. Pass
a tax increase that funds the government at the levels requested by
President Obama without any significant spending reforms.
( )
I am not sure at
this time.
