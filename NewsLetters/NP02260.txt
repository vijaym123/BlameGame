POLITICO : Iran letter blowback startles GOP
WHOA. We did not expect this. The Republicans insulted President Obama by completely undermining his negotiations with Iran -- and it has backfired, BIG TIME.
Thanks to you, average Americans are seeing how grossly disrespectful and dangerous Republicans have become. The repercussions they are seeing after trying to sabotage President Obama&rsquo;s negotiations with Iran are leaving them breathless.
But by TOMORROW, we still need $40,000 for our Republican Accountability Fund to get the word out.
If you are an Obama supporter, this is the most important moment IN HISTORY to have his back.
You CAN&rsquo;T let the GOP sabotage him.

The
New York Times
reports that the Republicans&rsquo; letter was &ldquo;disgraceful and irresponsible&rdquo; -- they even call it &ldquo;IDIOCY.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re a strong Democrat, and that means you simply can&rsquo;t let the GOP run over your President right now.
