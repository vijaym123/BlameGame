ICYMI: Rubio Discusses Obamas
Failed Policies, Restoring The American
Dream
In an interview on FOX News
FOX
and Friends , Marco discussed
President Obamas failed policies
and the need to take full advantage of
the opportunities of the 21
st
century. An excerpt of the
interview is below:
Rubio: This should also be an
American century. This 21
st
century is an exciting
time. We are not taking full advantage
of all of the opportunities of this new
era, and a lot of that is because of
flawed policies of big government that
this President and his allies in the
Senate have pursued.

Rubio Comments On Protests In Hong
Kong
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the ongoing protests in Hong
Kong:
The people of Hong Kong want
nothing more than what those in free
countries around the globe have: the
right to peacefully assemble, speak
freely and choose their own leaders.
The protesters have taken to the
streets peacefully, with nothing more
than umbrellas in hand. The security
forces use tear gas and threaten
greater force. They use police
investigative powers to intimidate free
press and those who support rights of
free association. Meanwhile, the
government in Beijing censors news and
information about developments in Hong
Kong to those on the mainland, going so
far as to block social media sites such
as Instagram.
I
wrote
Secretary of State Kerry two weeks
ago
urging him to forcefully speak
out on behalf of the citizens of Hong
Kong. We must make clear that any
violence against peaceful protesters
will have significant consequences for
U.S.-China relations. That is why I am
disheartened that our Consulate General
in Hong Kong would say that the U.S.
does not take sides in the
discussion of Hong Kongs
political development.
America absolutely takes
sides when confronted with right and
wrong. It is longstanding U.S. policy,
enshrined in the Hong Kong Policy Act
of 1992, to support democratization in
Hong Kong and to support the human
rights of the people of Hong Kong.
America should be on the side
of those in the street peacefully
protesting for their fundamental
freedoms. I again call on the Obama
administration to make clear to China
that it must abide by its international
commitments regarding Hong Kongs
status and allow direct elections of
Hong Kongs chief
executive.
Rubio: GAO Makes Clear Obamacare
Bailouts Cant Occur Without
Congressional Approval
Marco, the lead sponsor of
The
ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention
Act
and
The
ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Protection
Act , commented on the legal opinion
released by the Government Accountability
Office (GAO) regarding taxpayer-funded
bailouts of health insurance companies
under ObamaCare.
According
to the GAO , the Department of Health
and Human Service (HHS) cannot
unilaterally make payments to health
insurance companies under
ObamaCares risk corridor program
in 2015 and beyond. On the contrary, HHS
must seek and attain appropriations
authority.
As many of us predicted,
Obamacare is a failure that forces the
American people to not only buy health
insurance, but also forces the American
taxpayer to bail out insurance
companies that incur a loss under the
Obamacare exchanges,
said Rubio . The fact that
we have to bail out ObamaCare in the
first place tells us the law is a
failure.
We should not be bailing out
a failure,
Rubio added . Given the
Obama Administrations history of
taking executive action to re-write
Obamacare and ignoring the legislative
process, Congress needs to make sure
taxpayers dont end up paying for
an ObamaCare bailout in 2015 or
ever.
ICYMI: Rubio: Hats Off To The
University Of Tennessee For Standing Up
For Public Prayer
In an op-ed for
The
Daily Caller
, Marco, a University of Florida
alum, commended the University of
Tennessee for standing up for public
prayer amid demands from anti-religion
interest groups to stop Tennessees
tradition of observing a moment of
non-denominational prayer before kickoff.
An excerpt from the article is below:
Those who attack public
prayer
whether it occurs at
schools, in legislatures or football
stadiums
all have in common a
dream of moving toward a naked
public square. Their goals and
tactics aim to make religion
stigmatized, feared and something best
kept private. Fortunately, however,
Americas long-standing tradition
of welcoming prayers in public settings
have been defended by the vast majority
of Americans, protected by law and
upheld by several court decisions.
So as we get ready for this
weekends Florida-Tennessee game,
Gator fans like me will at least
rejoice in knowing that, although we
cant do anything about silencing
the Tennessee marching band from
playing Rocky Top (over
and over and over again), the vast
majority of Gator and Volunteer fans
alike stand together for at least a
couple of things: 1) in knowing the SEC
is the king of college football, and 2)
for our right to pray together before
kickoff and give thanks for all our
blessings.

Constituent Casework Corner
Harriet is a veterans widow and
she was homeless living with friends in
North Florida. She applied for Dependency
and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but
her application was denied. She filed an
appeal and due to her dire financial
situation she contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance. A
member of the staff contacted the VA to
request an expeditious review. The agency
subsequently agreed to review the
application and her appeal was approved.
Last month, Harriet received a $35,000
retroactive check and will begin to
receive her monthly benefits.
