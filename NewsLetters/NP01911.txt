Dear David,
As we mark the 5th anniversary of
ObamaCare becoming law today, I'm still fighting to repeal this flawed
law and replace it with
common-sense health care
solutions .
Missouri was one of the first states in
the nation to reject the president's health care law, and for good
reason:
ObamaCare is fundamentally flawed .
For
five years, I've heard from countless workers, seniors, and families
across Missouri who are facing higher costs and fewer choices due to
the president's health care take-over.
I
shared
those real stories on the Senate floor for a year after the
ObamaCare exchanges opened. And I'm still taking an active role with
my colleagues in the Senate to find a better health care alternative
for all Americans.
As always, I invite you to join the
conversation online by sharing your thoughts on
Facebook ,
Twitter , on
Instagram ,
and by subscribing to my
YouTube

Sincere regards,
