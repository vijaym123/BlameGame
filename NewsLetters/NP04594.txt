Last week, a Russian member of the Taliban
pleaded
not guilty to terrorism charges, including an attack against the United States in Afghanistan.
According to the
indictment , Irek Hamidullan was charged with providing material support to terrorists, attempting to destroy a U.S. aircraft, and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.
Hamidullan is the first military detainee from Afghanistan brought to the United States to be tried in a criminal court.
The National Security Council said the decision to transfer the detainee was the result of an
agreement
between the United States and Afghanistan that the U.S. will not operate or maintain prisons in Afghanistan by 2015.
