Friends,
Thank you for allowing me periodically to provide you with information
relating to my office and what is happening in Congress. You may find
more information and the latest updates on my work in Congress on my
Facebook Page
, where I explain every vote I take. Please note
that you do not need to have a Facebook account to view my posts.
Stop taxpayer funding of abortion
I voted yes on H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act
. This legislation
makes permanent current federal laws that prohibit taxpayer dollars
from being used to fund abortions. In addition, the bill prevents
taxpayer dollars from subsidizing Obamacare insurance plans that
include coverage for elective abortions. Using taxpayer dollars to pay
for the killing of innocent lives is unconscionable. Our country was
founded on the ideal of individual liberty, and preserving that liberty
must include preserving the right to be born.
Monitoring the IRS
I voted yes on H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by
the IRS Act of 2014
,
which is in response to proposed regulations from the Internal

Revenue Service (IRS) that threaten the tax-exempt status of
501(c)(4) social welfare organizations that perform certain nonpartisan
political activities. The bill prohibits any changes to the 501(c)(4)
standards for one year, giving the Committee on Ways and Means time to
finish its investigation into the IRS's targeting of conservative
groups. H.R. 3865 passed the House of Representatives 243-176.
Stop Common Core
I joined a coalition with 42 other congressmen to introduce legislation
condemning the federal government's intervention in local schools
through "Common Core" standards
. The resolution, H. Res. 476
, calls on states
and school boards to "maintain the right and responsibility of
determining educational curricula," and calls on the federal government
to stop providing incentives to adopt Common Core.
The federal government should not impose Common Core standards and
curriculum on our kids. We have a strong tradition in this country of
parental control of education, which fosters competition and diverse
approaches to learning. That tradition is embodied in the Tenth
Amendment, which is supposed to bar this kind of federal interference.
Legislation introduced to end bank bailouts
Six of my colleagues joined me to introduce H.R. 3550, the New Fair
Deal Banking and Housing Stability Act of 2013
. This bill phases out
subsidies and regulations that dangerously distort the economy, and it
expands the freedom of families and individuals to choose mortgage
products that work for them. The bill reforms bank funding rules to
close loopholes that banks exploited to put taxpayers and the economy
at risk instead of owners. It repeals provisions of law that have been
abused to bail out well-connected financial firms. H.R. 3550 would also
require reforms to the bankruptcy code so that taxpayers will not be on
the hook to bail out failing financial institutions.
Google endorses the USA FREEDOM Act
We are thrilled to have Google endorse the USA FREEDOM Act
.
The biggest names in tech
are getting behind the Freedom Act because it is the only legislation
that protects Americans' privacy from unconstitutional government
surveillance. Momentum is on our side, and I have no doubt that the
Freedom Act would pass today if it were brought to the floor for a vote.
Recent Events
*	It was great to hear from everyone who came out to Tuesday
night's town hall
in
Alpine Township.
*	I was proud to nominate 19 students from West Michigan
for appointment to the U.S. service academies. The nominees will be
considered for the class of 2018 at the U.S. Air Force Academy, the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy (West Point),
and the U.S. Naval Academy.
*	I've made it my mission since the first day in office to defend
the Constitution and advance individual liberty. I'm honored that my
work over the last three years has been recognized
by
every conservative group that tracks Congress.
