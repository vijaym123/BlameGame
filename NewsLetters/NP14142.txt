Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an Investor's Business Daily
(IBD) editorial I recently read titled, "Is Welfare the New Normal?
"
I read this several weeks ago, and decided to forward it now because
earlier this week WLFI ran a story
regarding SNAP
benefits and an anticipated vote on a Farm Bill that is being debated
in a Senate-House Conference Committee.
Much of the debate has hinged
on reforms to our food stamp program.
In our communities and across our country, we must have a serious
debate about how best to help our neighbors in need, and first, who
really is in need on a relative basis.
As IBD's editorial concludes,
we are seeing record numbers of spending on welfare, welfare
dependents, and working age Americans no longer in the labor force,
several years since the Great Recession officially ended.
We must have
an honest debate about these numbers, who to help, how best to help,
and how not to take money from our children and grandchildren in doing
it.

Repeal of ObamaCare Still the Goal
This week, the House passed legislation, the Keep Your Health Plan Act
that I cosponsored to help prevent ObamaCare
from forcing millions of Americans from their individual health plans.
The bill passed the House with bipartisan support 261-157
.
Real people are feeling real pain due to the harmful impact of
ObamaCare and I will continue standing up for them by chipping away at
this law, and working for its complete repeal.
The President willfully
deceived the American people when he told them they could keep their
insurance, underscoring just how insidious
ObamaCare really is.
Hoosiers like Rick Lee of Plainfield, who
contacted me last week about his cancellation letter
, are
upset that they now will have to purchase more expensive insurance they
simply do not want or need.
The Obama Administration's own Federal Register, in 2010, estimated up
to 93 million
could lose their insurance plan.
While millions are losing
their preferred plans, others are having difficulty signing up for the
federal exchanges.
The Obama Administration announced this week that just 26,000 Americans
successfully enrolled in the federal health care exchanges
. In Indiana, only about 700
Hoosiers signed up
.
Clearly, and in contrast to the ObamaCare's government knows best
philosophy, health care reform should focus on patients and the best
outcome for each individual.
Honest reforms like the American Health
Care Reform Act, which I introduced in September, offer
patient-centered, free market health care solutions that increase
competition, lower costs, improve access for vulnerable Americans, and
reform medical liability law.

Care Reform Act here

ObamaCare's Impact on Schools, Colleges, and Universities
On Thursday, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce held a
hearing to examine the impact that ObamaCare is having on our schools,
colleges, and universities.
You can watch my exchange with witnesses here
:
Every day we learn more of the harmful effects of ObamaCare, a law that
we were told by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi we would have to "pass it to
find out what's in it."
Hoosiers are learning the negative impact that
this redistributive law is having on our schools, in addition to the
rest of our lives.
Schools across Indiana are being forced to cut hours, and in some cases
employees because they cannot meet the financial demands placed on them
by ObamaCare regulations and skyrocketing insurance premiums. This is
depriving students of many key support staff and instructional aides.
In our colleges and universities, like Ivy Tech Community College,
part-time instructors are being forced to teach less hours, limiting
the access of students to experienced instructors.
This is just one more example of the unintended consequences of
ObamaCare and why it is so important we must continue to fight to
protect Hoosiers by delaying, defunding, and repealing it.

Team Rokita Recognizes 15q Day - Supports Angelman Syndrome
On Friday, Team Rokita dressed in blue to recognize International 15q
Day, a day to raise awareness of the similarities between Angelman,
Prader-Willi, and Chromosome 15q Duplication syndromes.
All three are
genetic disorders and their complications originate in the 15th
chromosome.
My son, Teddy, who is nearly 6 years old, was diagnosed with Angelman
Syndrome in 2010.
Angelman significantly impairs his capacity for
motor development and severely inhibits his intellectual development.
In addition to that, it is likely he will never speak. But through his
challenges, he is such an inspiration to everyone he meets.
We do not
know what Teddy's ultimate impact on this world will be, but we know it
will be great.
I also made remarks on the House floor to recognize 15q Day and thank
my staff for their help today.
You can view those remarks here
.

Helping Our Neighbors - Our Annual Food Drive
Our two district office locations are now accepting nonperishable food
donation items for our annual holiday food drive through Friday,
December 20.
As you'll recall, this is the second year in a row we are collecting
food for local food pantries.
Earlier this year, during the August
town hall events, we also collected food items.
Year-to-date, you have
helped our offices collect 500 pounds of food.
Office hours are open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday.
Addresses for my Danville and Lafayette offices are below.

ObamaCare Insurance Cancellations Continue to Hit Mailboxes
It has been widely reported that millions of Americans are being sent
cancellation notices of their insurance policies
due to forced changes under ObamaCare.
These
cancellations come despite the promise made by the President, time and
again, that, "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your
plan."
If you or someone you know has had a similar experience, please
send me your insurance cancellation notices at
InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Repeal
of

Still
the
Goal
This

House
passed legislation,
the
Keep
Your

that
I
cosponsored

help
prevent
ObamaCare
from forcing
millions
of
Americans
from

The
bill

the

with

261-157 .
Real

and
I
will
continue
standing

The

the
American
people
when
he

their

underscoring
just
how
insidious
ObamaCare
really
is.
Hoosiers
like
Rick
Lee
of
Plainfield ,
who
contacted
me
last
week
about
his
cancellation
letter ,
are
upset
that
they
now
will
have
to
purchase
more
expensive
insurance
they
simply
do
not
want
or
need.
The
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
own
Federal
Register ,
in
2010,
estimated up
to
93
million
could
lose
their
insurance
plan.
While
millions
are
losing
their
preferred
plans,
others
are
having
difficulty
signing
up
for
the
federal
exchanges.
The
Obama
Administration
announced
this
week
that
just
26,000
Americans
successfully
enrolled
in
the
federal
health
care
exchanges .
In
Indiana,
only
about
700
Hoosiers
signed
up .
Clearly,
and
in
contrast
to
the
ObamaCare&#8217;s
government
knows
best
philosophy,
health
care
reform
should
focus
on
patients
and
the
best
outcome
for
each

Honest
reforms
like
the
American
Health
Care
Reform
Act ,
which
I
introduced
in
September,
offer
patient-centered,
free
market
health
care
solutions
that
increase
competition,
lower
costs,
improve
access
for
vulnerable
Americans,
and
reform
medical
liability
law.

ObamaCare's
Impact
on
Schools,
Colleges,
and
Universities
On
Thursday,
the
House
Committee
on
Education
and
the
Workforce
held
a
hearing
to
examine
the
impact
that
ObamaCare is
having on
our
schools,
colleges,
and
universities.
You
can
watch
my
exchange
with
witnesses
here :
Every
day
we
learn
more
of
the
harmful
effects
of
ObamaCare,
a
law
that
we
were
told
by
then-Speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
we
would
have
to
"pass
it
to
find
out
what's
in
it."
Hoosiers
are
learning
the negative
impact that
this
redistributive
law
is
having
on
our
schools,
in
addition
to
the
rest
of
our
lives.
Schools
across
Indiana
are
being
forced
to
cut
hours,
and
in
some
cases
employees
because
they
cannot
meet
the
financial
demands
placed
on
them
by
ObamaCare
regulations
and
skyrocketing
insurance
premiums.
This
is
depriving
students
of
many
key
support
staff
and
instructional
aides.
In
our
colleges
and
universities,
like
Ivy
Tech
Community
College,
part-time
instructors
are
being
forced
to
teach
less
hours, limiting
the
access of students
to
experienced
instructors.
This
is
just
one
more
example
of
the
unintended
consequences
of
ObamaCare
and
why
it
is
so
important
we
must
continue
to
fight
to
protect
Hoosiers
by
delaying,
defunding,
and

it.
