Despite all the progress the economy has made since the depths of the economic crisis, there are still almost 3 unemployed people for every one job opening today.
The long-term unemployed are in a particularly difficult position. There are many of them &ndash; more than 1/3 of the unemployed have been out of work for half a year or more. Studies have shown that even as their financial position deteriorates, they are much less likely to be hired even if qualified.
That is why we established the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program. It is outrageous that Congress allowed this program to expire at the end of last year.
I support legislation to restore this program and provide the unemployed the help they need to continue their search for work.
About 20,000 Oregonians lost their unemployment insurance
when the program expired. Without action an additional
29,000 unemployed workers in Oregon
will lose their benefits in the first six months of 2014.
Congress must act before it is too late for millions of unemployed workers and their families.
It is important for us in Congress to have a clear picture of what is happening to these families, so I am asking for you to
share your view
on this important issue. If you have a story about how unemployment insurance impacts you, your family, or community, please

Thank you for sharing your views.
