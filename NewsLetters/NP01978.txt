Protecting Social Security
Last week I took to the House floor to speak on the need to reform social security disability insurance in order to protect the program for our seniors. Click on the image below to view it.
No Budget No Pay
This past week, I announced my cosponsorship of the "no budget no pay" legislative reform and pressed both chambers of Congress to pass a budget. With the recent GOP takeover of the Senate it is high time to focus on our Nation&rsquo;s priorities.
I care about our nation&rsquo;s future. Each and every family has to work with a budget; our Congress should be no different. That is why I am calling for &ldquo;No Budget No Pay&rdquo; as an accountability reform measure for members of congress to the American people. It is only fair we put the gimmickry of the last congress behind us. We need to work together towards passing a budget that puts us on a path to balancing our budget as a nation, and enables debt reduction so our kids and grand-kids are not left to pay the tab and true job growth where generations will have opportunities to enjoy the American dream.&rdquo;
Background:
No Budget No Pay Act(s) are two bills that would restrict lawmaker pay if the budget is not passed by a specific deadline.
Cooper (D-TN) bill which prohibits pay for any Member or Senator if a concurrent budget resolution and all 12 appropriations bills are not passed by 10/1.
Wittman (R-VA) bill withholds Member pay if a budget is not agreed to by 4/16 until a time when the budget is agreed to.

Natural Gas Caucus hosted an event that highlighted the benefits of domestic natural gas production.
Utilizing our diverse North American energy resources reduces our dependence on Middle East crude oil. This is fair to all Americans, especially those struggling to pay high energy costs and find jobs in this uncertain economy. This is why I support an "all-of-the-above" approach to domestic energy production.
