Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Votes to Support Ukraine and Sanction Russia
Congressman Cook applauded the passage of H.R. 4278, the Ukraine
Support Act. This legislation, which passed last Thursday on an
overwhelming bipartisan vote of 399-19, imposes sanctions on Russia and
provides support for the pro-western government of Ukraine.
This legislation will codify the sanctions on Russian officials and
will allow additional targeted sanctions to be imposed on corrupt
Russian officials. It urges the President to expand sanctions on
Russian leaders engaged in massive human rights violations and
international aggression. It also authorizes additional American
support to the Ukrainian government, which is fully offset by
reductions in American aid to Pakistan.
Congressman Cook also cosponsored H.R. 4155, legislation to streamline
the approval process for American natural gas exports. While America
has emerged as the world's largest producer of natural gas, Russia
remains the world's largest gas exporter. This would create thousands
of good-paying American jobs while reducing the dependence of key
American allies on Russian energy.
The passage of the Ukraine Support Act sends Russia a message that
aggression will no longer be tolerated and the United States will stand
with its democratic allies. The days when a rogue empire like Russia
could make war on its neighbors without paying a price are at an end.
By supporting the democratic government of Ukraine, expanding American
energy production and exports, and sanctioning Putin and his cronies,
America can deter further aggression and keep the peace in Europe.
Congressman Cook Votes to Protect Public Input in Federal Land
Designations
Last week, Congressman Cook voted in favor of H.R. 1459, the "Ensuring
Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act." This
important legislation will require public participation before a
Presidentially declared National Monument is made official. It passed
out of the House of Representatives by a vote of 222-201 and is now
headed to the Senate for consideration.
Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, presidents are able to designate
unilaterally National Monuments without any input or involvement from
the American public, community leaders, or local elected officials.
This authority was intended to be used in emergencies to protect
historic artifacts and sites of scientific value from imminent threat.
Unfortunately, since its establishment, the Antiquities Act has been
misused for political purposes by presidents from both parties by
placing vast expanses of public land outside of public use.
This bill would guarantee the American people and local officials an
opportunity to participate in these crucial decisions that impact their
communities by requiring that all presidential designations undergo the
same process as most other public land-use decisions. This would
include a public comment period.
Local land use decisions must include local governments and residents.
No President should have the power to restrict unilaterally public use
and access to millions of acres of land without first allowing those
who are most affected an opportunity for meaningful input. This bill
will ensure that the public, not just the president, has a voice in how
our public lands are used and protected.
A Message From Congressman Cook on Strengthening Necessary Public
Services
Americans should not be asked to trust their government if they are not
receiving effective and efficient public services. In California,
cities across the state are facing budget shortfalls that threaten to
compromise the quality of essential services rendered to the public,
none of which are more important than public safety. For this reason, I
am proud to support appropriations requests that will give firefighters
and police officers the tools they need to protect our citizens and
save lives.

Helping Veterans Navigate the Inept Department of Veterans Affairs
A 79 year old veteran from Yucca Valley came into my office requesting
assistance with his VA appeal. The veteran had originally filed in 2007
for hearing loss due to his service connected disability from his time
spent in artillery while serving in the USMC. The VA originally denied
his claim, three times failing to recognize his service connection. My
staff was able to submit photos and other documentation provided by the
veteran that firmly established his service connection. The veteran was
granted 40 percent service connected disability retroactive to the date
of original filing.

Congressman

of
H.R.
4278,
the
Ukraine

This
legislation,
which
passed
last
Thursday

corrupt
Russian
officials.
It
urges
the
President
to

on

engaged

It

Congressman
Cook
Votes
to
Protect
Public
Input
in
Federal
Land
Designations
Last
week,
Congressman
Cook
voted
in
favor
of
H.R.
1459,
the
&#8220;Ensuring
Public
Involvement
in
the
Creation
of
National
Monuments
Act.&#8221;
This
important
legislation
will
require
public
participation
before
a
Presidentially
declared
National
Monument
is
made
official.
It
passed
out
of
the
House
of
Representatives
by
a
vote
of
222-201
and
is
now
headed
to
the
Senate
for
consideration.
Under
the
1906
Antiquities
Act,
presidents
are
able
to
designate
unilaterally
National
Monuments
without
any
input
or
involvement
from
the
American
public,
community
leaders,
or
local
elected
officials.
This
authority
was
intended
to
be
used
in
emergencies
to
protect
historic
artifacts
and
sites
of
scientific
value
from
imminent
threat.
Unfortunately,
since
its
establishment,
the
Antiquities
Act
has
been
misused
for
political
purposes
by
presidents
from
both
parties
by
placing
vast
expanses
of
public
land
outside
of
public
use.
This
bill
would
guarantee
the
American
people
and
local
officials
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
these
crucial
decisions
that
impact
their
communities
by
requiring
that
all
presidential
designations
undergo
the
same
process
as
most
other
public
land-use
decisions.
This
would
include
a
public
comment
period.
Local
land
use
decisions
must
include
local
governments
and
residents.
No
President
should
have
the
power
to
restrict
unilaterally
public
use
and
access
to
millions
of
acres
of
land
without
first
allowing
those
who
are
most
affected
an
opportunity
for
meaningful
input.
This
bill
will
ensure
that
the
public,
not
just
the
president,
has
a
voice
in
how
our
public
lands
are
used
and
protected.
A
Message
From
Congressman
Cook
on
Strengthening
Necessary
Public
Services
Americans
should
not
be
asked
to
trust
their
government
if
they
are
not
receiving
effective
and
efficient
public
services.
In
California,
cities
across
the
state
are
facing
budget
shortfalls
that
threaten
to
compromise
the
quality
of
essential
services
rendered
to
the
public,
none
of
which
are
more
important
than
public
safety.
For
this
reason,
I
am
proud
to
support
appropriations
requests
that
will
give
firefighters
and
police
officers
the
tools
they
need
to
protect
our
citizens
and
save
lives.
