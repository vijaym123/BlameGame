Urging Action to Restore Emergency
Unemployment Insurance
Dear Friend,
The expiration of emergency unemployment insurance at the end of 2013
has taken a major toll on Pennsylvanians who are struggling to find
work and to support their families. The Senate is on track to pass
bipartisan legislation next week to extend this vital economic lifeline
for more than 2 million Americans who have been out of work for at
least 27 weeks. Unfortunately, House Republican leaders continue to
block efforts to restore these critical benefits.
In Pennsylvania, almost 75,000 people were immediately cut off from
emergency unemployment insurance when it expired at the end of 2013,
according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. Through
March 15, that figure increased to over 110,000 Pennsylvanians. This
includes more than 5,000 people in Montgomery County and almost 18,000
people in Philadelphia County.
The bill (H.R. 3979) advancing in the Senate extends emergency
unemployment insurance retroactively through May. But this bipartisan
agreement will still require action by the House before it can become
law. By the end of May, the U.S. Labor Department estimates that
158,400 Pennsylvanians and 2.8 million Americans will have lost their
emergency unemployment compensation. Failing to extend this emergency
assistance will harm families and hold back our nation's economic
recovery.
I will continue fighting to ease the painful effects of long-term
unemployment on Pennsylvania's families. As always, it is a privilege
to represent you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Urging
Action
to
Restore
Emergency
Unemployment
Insurance
Dear
Friend,
The
expiration
of
emergency
unemployment
insurance
at
the
end
of
2013
has
taken
a
major
toll
on
Pennsylvanians
who
are
struggling
to
find
work
and
to
support
their
families.
The
Senate
is
on
track
to
pass
bipartisan
legislation
next
week
to
extend
this
vital
economic
lifeline
for
more
than
2
million
Americans
who
have
been
out
of
work
for
at
least
27
weeks.
Unfortunately,
House
Republican
leaders
continue
to
block
efforts
to
restore
these
critical
benefits.
In
Pennsylvania,
almost
75,000
people
were
immediately
cut
off
from
emergency
unemployment
insurance
when
it
expired
at
the
end
of
2013,
according
to
the
Pennsylvania
Department
of
Labor
and
Industry.
Through
March
15,
that
figure
increased
to
over
110,000
Pennsylvanians.
This
includes
more
than
5,000
people
in
Montgomery
County
and
almost
18,000
people
in
Philadelphia
County.
The
bill
(H.R.
3979)
advancing
in
the
Senate
extends
emergency
unemployment
insurance
retroactively
through
May.
But
this
bipartisan
agreement
will
still
require
action
by
the
House
before
it
can
become
law.
By
the
end
of
May,
the
U.S.
Labor
Department
estimates
that
158,400
Pennsylvanians
and
2.8
million
Americans
will
have
lost
their
emergency
unemployment
compensation.
Failing
to
extend
this
emergency
assistance
will
harm
families
and
hold
back
our
nation&#8217;s
economic
recovery.
I
will
continue
fighting
to
ease
the
painful

of
long-term
unemployment
on
Pennsylvania's
families.
As

it
is
a
