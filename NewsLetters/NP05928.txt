&ldquo;The Senate is a toss up&rdquo; - The
Washington Post , 9/23/2014
Dear Friend,
All the polls and all the models agree that control of the Senate this year will rest on a razor-thin margin.
The
Washington Post
is calling the Senate a toss up, and that means grassroots organizations like ours can make a real difference.
Here in Massachusetts, we&rsquo;re depending on grassroots supporters to help us keep the Bay State&rsquo;s Senate seat blue. But our field team needs resources to do their work, and we depend on you to make that happen. Our final FEC deadline of the cycle is a little more than 48 hours away. And with less than six weeks to go to Election Day, the Senate is anyone&rsquo;s game. Please, give $5 today to keep our team going strong.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
The lesson of 2010 was that Democrats can&rsquo;t afford to take a midterm election off. When we do, the results are gridlock, dysfunction, and the rise of the Tea Party.
But when we&rsquo;re engaged -- when we all pull together behind candidates who fight for our progressive values -- we know we can win. The stakes are too high for us to give anything less than our best. Help us finish strong by hitting our $145,OOO FEC goal in time -- give $5, $10, or more if you can.
Thank you,
Ed
