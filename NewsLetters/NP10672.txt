Balance The Budget, Grow The Economy &amp; Protect
Paychecks
I want to take a minute to
update you on an important event that takes place each year in
Congress, and thats adopting the federal budget for the upcoming year
or
in this case, the Fiscal Year 2015 Budget Resolution.
A budget is a statement of priorities; it is a
fiscal blueprint that is fundamental to our service as elected
representatives.
People in Missouris Sixth District must live within
their own budgets, and Washington must do the same.
I was proud to join with my colleagues last week
to support the Republican plan that puts our fiscal house in order by
agreeing to a responsible, balanced budget and grow the economy.
This plan targets wasteful spending, strengthens seniors Medicare,
and expands opportunity through long-overdue tax reform.
Borrowing nearly 40 cents on every dollar and with the federal debt totaling
over $17.5 trillion, once again House Republicans chose a path toward
long-term fiscal sustainability and solvency, instead of continued
deficit, debt and decline on the backs of middle class families.
The
budget also makes sure our men and women in uniform have the best
resources to protect our national security.
It was critical that this years budget repeal Obamacare
and clear the way for patient-centered reform; the Presidents law is
far too flawed to stand as law of the land.
The budget plan put forward from the other side of the
aisle spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much.
Specifically, it would raise taxes by an additional $1.8 trillion,
increase spending by more than $740 billion, and increase debt by $4.3
trillion.
Elected representatives
are entrusted with a solemn responsibility to tend the nations
business and secure a more prosperous America now and for the next
generation.
Please know that as your Congressman, I will continue to
support sound fiscal policies, like a balanced budget.
Sincerely,
Sam
Graves
