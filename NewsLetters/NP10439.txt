Dear Friend,
On April 7, 2014, the U.S. Senate, under the leadership of Senator Jack
Reed (D-RI), voted to extend unemployment benefits to the more than 2.4
million Americans[1]
, including nearly 9,000 Rhode Islanders[2]
, whose benefits have expired since December 28, 2013.
This bill is now awaiting consideration by the House of
Representatives, but Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has not brought this
critical legislation to a vote on the House Floor.
In an effort to
bring attention to this vital issue, I recently launched the "Faces of
the Unemployed" project to help put a human face on this crisis and
raise awareness of this problem.
The debate over renewing unemployment benefits is about more than just
dollars and cents. It is about the families who continue to lose
unemployment benefits with each passing day that the House fails to
act. It is about the more than 200,000 veterans and more than 1 million
children who have been affected by the loss of these benefits.[3]
Over the past four months, I have heard from countless
Rhode Islanders about having to move into homeless shelters, and not
being able to provide for their families because they have lost their
benefits. Now it is time for the rest of Congress to hear and see those
stories as well every time they walk down the halls and to the House
Floor.
When Congress returns on April 28th, I will be posting the "Faces of
the Unemployed"
outside of my office in Washington. My colleagues
need to see the true impact of failing to extend these benefits by
seeing the faces and reading the stories of real Americans who continue
to struggle. If you or a friend or family member is unemployed and you
are comfortable sharing your story and would like to participate in
this project, please visit my website at
http://cicilline.house.gov/tell-your-story
.
You can also speak with Lisha Gomes in my
District Office in Pawtucket at Lisha.Gomes@mail.house.gov
.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact my office at
(401) 729-5600.
Please know that I will continue to fight to restore
these critical benefits to our nation's long-term unemployed.
My best always,
David Cicilline

OUR
DISTRICT
April 21,
2014
Dear
Friend,
On
April
7,
2014,
the
U.S.
Senate,
under
the
leadership
of
Senator
Jack
Reed
(D-RI),
voted
to
extend
unemployment
benefits
to
the
more
than
2.4
million
Americans [1] ,
including
nearly
9,000
Rhode
Islanders [2] ,
whose
benefits
have
expired
since
December
28,
2013.
This
bill
is
now
awaiting
consideration
by
the
House
of
Representatives,
but
Speaker
John
Boehner
(R-OH) has
not
brought
this
critical
legislation
to
a
vote
on
the
House
Floor.
In
an
effort
to
bring
attention
to
this
vital
issue, I
recently
launched
the
&#8220;Faces
of
the
Unemployed&#8221;
project
to
help
put
a
human
face
on
this
crisis
and
raise
awareness
of
this
problem.
The
debate
over
renewing
unemployment
benefits
is
about
more
than
just
dollars
and
cents.
It
is
about
the
families
who
continue
to
lose
unemployment
benefits
with
each
passing
day
that
the
House
fails
to
act.
It
is
about
the
more
than
200,000
veterans
and
more
than
1
million
children
who
have
been
affected
by
the
loss
of
these
benefits. [3]
Over
the
past
four
months,
I
have
heard
from
countless
Rhode
Islanders
about
having
to
move
into
homeless
shelters,
and
not
being
able
to
provide
for
their
families
because
they
have
lost
their
benefits.
Now
it
is
time
for
the
rest
of
Congress
to
hear
and
see
those
stories
as
well
every
time
they
walk
down
the
halls
and
to
the
House
Floor.
When
Congress
returns
on
April
28 th ,
I
will
be
posting
the
&#8220; Faces
of
the
Unemployed&#8221;
outside
of
my
office
in
Washington.
My
colleagues
need
to
see
the
true
impact
of
failing
to
extend
these
benefits
by
seeing
the
faces
and
reading
the
stories
of
real
Americans
who
continue
to
struggle.
If
you
or
a
friend
or
family
member
is
unemployed
and
you
are
comfortable
sharing
your
story
and
would

to
participate

this

Please
know
that
I
will
continue
to

our
nation&#8217;s
long-term
unemployed.
