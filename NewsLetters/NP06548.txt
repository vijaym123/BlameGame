Friends,
During the district work month, I enjoyed meeting with
constituents across the district to discuss the importance of securing our
border, growing our economy, and making America more competitive.
If we did not have the opportunity to meet, I hope to see you when
I am back in the Palmetto State during the October district work
month.
While the focus of
the district work month was jobs and competitiveness, many of you
expressed your concerns about the unrest in the world.
As you know,
radical Islamic terrorists are wreaking havoc in the Middle East.
This terrorist cell, known as ISIS or ISIL, is attempting to form an
Islamic State with the goal of taking over much of the region and
destroying Democracy.
Americans, and countries around the World, are
looking for leadership and a plan on how to defeat this savage
terrorist group.
On Wednesday, President Obama will present his
plan to the nation and international community.
This Administration has tried to
lead from behind for too long.
We must stand by our allies and
work with NATO and Europe to ensure that foreign aggressions and
barbaric, senseless killings will not be tolerated.
I look forward to
hearing from the President and it is my hope that his strategy puts
America on offense again.
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives is in session this week and
is scheduled to vote on important legislation that impacts Americans'
daily lives.
We will continue working to make America more energy
independent, add more good-paying jobs to our economy, and rein in
the EPA's attempt to over regulate our nation's waters.

As always, it in an honor to represent you and your family.
