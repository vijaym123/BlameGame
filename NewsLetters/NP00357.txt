Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Center
Update:
The emergency department at Colmery-ONeil VA
Medical Center continues to remain closed, despite repeated reassurances by
VA officials that the department would be reopened by the end of May.
This week I spoke with VA officials
including VA Secretary Bob
McDonald - to better understand the situation. I was extremely disappointed
and frustrated to hear that it could be as many as six weeks before
the emergency department is reopened. This situation is unacceptable
but my main priority is to ensure the safety and security of our
veterans healthcare. I will continue to monitor this situation closely until
the emergency department is reopened and is providing our veterans
with the healthcare services they need and deserve.

Working To
Repeal The Independent Payment Advisory Board:
This
week, at a Ways and Means Committee mark-up I spoke in favor of
repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). This Board was
created by the Presidents healthcare law but has consistently received
bipartisan opposition. If not repealed, I fear that IPABs cuts could be
based on the bottom line rather than on efforts to truly improve
efficiencies and find savings without compromising patient care. The
legislation passed favorably out of committee with a strong bipartisan vote
of 31-8.

IPAB and see my remarks from the committee
mark-up.
Congressional Hunger Center Awards:
I was
honored to receive the Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Emerging Hunger Leader
Award from the Congressional Hunger Center on Wednesday. I am proud
to be the co-chair of the
Congressional Hunger
Caucus
and helping lead the fight to bring an end hunger.
Upcoming
Coffees with Your Congresswoman:
Next Monday, I will
be hosting several Coffees with your Congresswoman all over Eastern
Kansas. I hope you can drop by, have a cup of coffee, and speak with me
directly about the issues most important to you. Listening to Kansans
is my top priority and I look forward to hearing your ideas and
bringing them back to Washington.
