Highlights in the Legislative Program
Protecting our fisheries at home and nationwide
Keeping fish stocks healthy for commercial fishermen, for those who use this resource to feed their families, and for our tourism economy today and into the future: that is my bottom-line. And the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act has played an important role in maintaining and rebuilding healthy stocks throughout America over the last three decades. Much remains to do, however; and we do not want to backslide on our hard won progress protecting this important economic resource. For that reason I had to vote against H.R. 4742,
a bill that would weaken Magnuson-Stevens, when it came up before the House Natural Resources Committee last week. This week, the 1.4 million member Natural Resources Defense Council thanked me for my vote , as did a number of Northern Marianas constituents. I certainly support changes to the Magnuson-Stevens Act that will improve management of our fisheries for the benefit of all. I look forward to more debate on the issue and to putting the Northern Mariana Islands in the forefront of shaping this important national policy.

Shirley Ann Tudela Sablan was recently named the 2014 First Hawaiian Bank and Guam Business Magazine Businesswoman of the Year and received the annual Magahaga Award. I presented Ms. Sablan with a Congressional Commendation, recognizing her achievement. Ms. Sablan exemplifies a new generation in our business community and we welcome the growing prominence of women in leadership. Congratulations, Shirley!
EPA carbon rules still open for the territories
The Environmental Protection Agency proposed guidelines this week for states to use in reducing carbon pollution from existing power plants. But EPA left open the question of what standard, if any, to place on power plants in the territories. The Carbon Power Plan
aims to cut the amount of carbon dioxide released by fossil fuel-burning electric utilities by 30 percent from 2005 levels over the next 15 years. Nationwide, CO2 emissions are already down 10 percent from the 2005 level. Further reductions in this greenhouse gas are needed to help slow climate change, improve public health, and encourage energy efficiency and greater use of renewable fuels. Although EPA did not propose specific CO2 goals for the territories, the agency said that it does expect to do so by June 2015. But first EPA plans to engage in discussion with the territories. The agency is also soliciting public comments
on the Carbon Power Plan over the next several months.

This week I presented a Congressional Commendation to Mr. Justin Kosam, a young man who is graduating from the Linala Malawasch Academy at Hopwood Jr. High School. Mr. Kosam, according to his teachers and counselors made the greatest effort among his 18 peers to be able to be promoted to high school next year.
Congratulations to Justin, his family, and
the Faculty and Staff at Hopwood Jr. High School and PSS for all they do to keep our students learning and focused on their futures.
Go Hilitais!
Vets helps vets by signing up
Problems with veterans health care are in the headlines. But did you know that the more veterans who are registered in the Northern Mariana Islands the higher level of service we can get for NMI vets? That is why I encourage every veteran, as well as our Active Duty, Reserve and National Guard servicemembers to enroll with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. To apply, see the VA Administrative Officer, Ruth Coleman, at the Saipan Outreach Clinic located in Room 206 at the Marina Heights Business Park, MHII Building in Puerto Rico. You can also submit your application online at http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apply/. Remember: even if you do not receive benefits, when you register as a resident of the Northern Mariana Islands, you are helping your comrades in arms.

The highly motivated students pictured here are preparing themselves to work in the hotel industry by taking the Skills, Tasks and Responsibility Training offered by Latte Training Institute. START is 180-hour course that introduces students to all aspects of hotel operations. Ms. Vicky Benavente (left), Executive Assistant Manager at the Pacific Islands Club, is teaching the current segment of training. START is available at no cost to our public high school students through a partnership with the American Hotel and Lodging Educational Institute developed by Latte founder Jim Arenovski (center rear). Upon successful completion of their training students will receive globally-recognized certification to present when they apply for work in the hospitality industry. Keep up the good work!
Its official: Labor extends the CW program
The U.S. Department of Labor has published Secretary Thomas E. Perez's decision to add five years to the immigration transition period in the Northern Marianas. Tuesdays publication in the Federal Register
makes the Secretarys action official and gives it the force of law. The announcement means the Commonwealth-only Transitional Worker, CW, program will end December 31, 2019 rather than at the end of this year. The Department of Homeland Security is still required to reduce the number of CW workers each year, however, and reach zero by the end of the transition period. Perez based his decision on analysis by his Department that concluded that ending the CW program would worsen the Commonwealths economic problems and limit growth. Perez also found that there are not enough unemployed U.S. workers in the Northern Marianas to fill all available jobs.

Ms. Vicki Borja of RadioCom, Acting Mayor of Saipan Ramon Camacho, Lt. Governor Jude Hofschneider, Governor Eloy Inos, Public Works Secretary Martin Sablan, and I cut the ribbon opening the traffic signal upgrade at the Joeten Kiyu Public Library intersection in Susupe this week. Traffic signals and other vehicular and pedestrian lighted signs, island wide, are being converted to energy saving LED technology. Other improvements, funded by the U.S. Congress and administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation, include removal and replacement of the controller cabinets and pedestrian push buttons and repainting of the crosswalk and stop bar markings on all the roads at this busy intersection.
USCIS answers questions on CW extension
Following up on the announcement of a five-year extension of the Commonwealth-only Transition Worker, CW, program, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued guidance
this week to answer initial questions that employers and workers may have. The agency said it would resume issuing CW permits for a full twelve months. Before the extension USCIS was only approving petitions for CW status through December 31, 2014. The agency also announced it will not go back and add time to permits that were issued for less than a full year. Other aspects of the CW program will remain unchanged. Spouses and minor children will still be able to obtain CW-2 status, allowing them to reside in the Northern Mariana Islands. The number of CW workers permitted will continue to be reduced each year. And the $325 CW application fee remains, as does the $150 CNMI Education Funding fee that is used by the Commonwealth government to train local workers.
