Martin Luther King Day
Although his life was
tragically cut short in 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked
tirelessly on behalf of the civil rights movement through nonviolent protests
based in his Christian faith. Through a law signed into effect by
President Ronal Reagan in 1983, we recognize his legacy each year on the
third Monday in January.
This year, my staff and I
commemorated Dr. King's life and legacy by performing community service at
home in Kansas. We volunteered at Harvesters in Kansas City, where we
helped prepare snack packs for poverty-stricken children in our
community to take home on the weekends. Nearly a quarter of Wyandotte County
residents are below the poverty level, much higher than the 13.7% in
Kansas overall.

America's New Congress: First Two Weeks of Action
Click
here to watch the video of Congressman Yoder's floor
speech.
Last week, I spoke on the House floor about rising to the
challenge to put forth bold solutions to our nation's
problems.
During the first two weeks of this new session, the House of
Representatives has been rising to that challenge. We've passed bills, several
in a bipartisan fashion, that will help the grow the economy, put our
veterans back to work, achieve energy independence, and secure our
borders.
I look forward to continuing to work on your
behalf as we move forward with our agenda for 2015.
House Acts to Defund Executive Order on Amnesty
Click here to watch
Congressman Yoder discuss his vote to defund the President's executive
order on amnesty.
Our
immigration system is broken. It does not work for those trying to come to
America legally and it provides incentives for those who break the law.
Unfortunately, in a misguided attempt to fix the system, this
Administration made it worse with its unilateral
action.
In circumventing Congress, the Administration ignored
the will of the American
people.
With my full support, the House passed legislation that defunds the
Presidents executive order, prevents any future money from being used to
grant federal benefits to illegal immigrants, and provides for the
largest border protection force in history.

vote.
Fair Tax Legislation Introduced in
House
Not only is our current tax code a constant drain on our
economy, but it is also fundamentally unfair. This year alone, over
half of all Americans
and many businesses
will pay no income tax
due to the numerous corporate loopholes existing in the current system.
Furthermore, the President is set to announce a new proposal that
would bring billions of dollars in tax increases in the name of social
policy.
I believe the best approach is to scrap this fatally
flawed system in favor of a flatter and fairer system. That is why I am
proud to cosponsor Representative Rob Woodalls (R-GA) proposal to do
just that, and install the Fair Tax in its place.
The Fair Tax Act, HR 25,
repeals the income,
employment, and estate and gift taxes and establishes a nationwide
sales tax. To ensure that each family can consume tax free at or beyond
the poverty level, it provides for a universal prebate. It also
abolishes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and entrusts the states with
collection of the tax.
As weve seen with the targeting
of conservative groups for their political beliefs, this
Administrations IRS is out of control. This proposal gives Americans of all
stripes the ability to control their own tax burden by choosing how much to
consume, thereby eliminating the need for an IRS altogether. I see no
better way to get the government out of our lives and our pocketbooks
than this proposal, and that is why I urge the House of
Representatives to take it up for passage as soon as possible.
Meeting with Secretary King
I enjoyed meeting with Kansas
Secretary of Transportation Mike King in my Washington, DC office
last week. We had a strong discussion about the infrastructure needs for
the State, as well as other KDOT priorities as we go forward in
2015.
House Committee Assignments Announced for 114th
Congress
For the first time in decades, we will be spending
less today than we did when I walked into Congress four years ago. Im
once again honored to serve on the Appropriations Committee and continue
to reduce spending in order to provide the American people with a
more efficient and effective government and balanced budgets.
In addition to returning to the
Agriculture Subcommittee and Financial Services and General Government
Subcommittee, I will be joining the Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development Subcommittee this session.
One of
my top priorities since coming to Congress has been to bring fiscal
responsibility and transparency to our federal government. I am
especially excited for the new opportunity to have a direct impact on funding
for the transportation and housing sectors, which are both vital to
the State of Kansas.
Our state has
always been a leader in the aviation industry, and this new assignment
gives me the opportunity to closely oversee the Federal Aviation
Administration to ensure it is striking the right balance between the least
burdensome, yet safest regulations. I will now have a stronger voice in
advocating on behalf of Kansas farmers and ranchers not only on
agriculture policy, but also in terms of how they transport their products
for sale. Whether that be by air, rail, or
road.
Something that strikes very close to home for my
constituents in the Kansas City Metro Area is infrastructure development. The
Department of Housing and Urban Development spends $60 billion per year
on things like subsidized mortgage loans. We must safeguard this
funding that helps grow our American economy by ensuring it is subject to
the strictest oversight.

assignments.
USO Congressional Caucus
Click here to
visit the USO Congressional Caucus website.
I am
proud to join over 200 of my House and Senate colleagues on the USO
Congressional Caucus this session. The caucus was formed in 2003 to enhance
the American people's outreach to the troops abroad and provides
another great link between servicemen and women and their representatives
on Capitol Hill.
Dynamic Scoring
One
of the lesser-discussed items passed during the first two weeks of the
new Congress was the rule instructing the Congressional Budget Office
to use dynamic scoring, as opposed to static scoring, when analyzing
the budgetary effects of legislation.
This is an important
technical fix to the way Congress considers legislation. Previously, the
CBO would assume that bills passed would not have an effect on the
trajectory of the overall economy. For example, when considering a tax
bill, CBO would simply consider the change in revenue for the federal
government as if the same amount of people were paying the same amount
of taxes. Now, with dynamic scoring, it will consider a more realistic
change in economic growth and consumer behavior based on the new tax
burden that may increase or decrease the amount of revenue. It will
give legislators a better, more accurate idea of how their bills will
benefit or harm the economy.
Detractors say that dynamic
scoring is another form of "voodoo econmics" that is subject to abuse.
I confidently voted for this change because I believe the non-partisan
CBO will to continue to act in a non-idealogical manner. Congress has
trusted the CBO to score legislation for decades, and this change
will only help in that process.

CBO.
Funding for Investment Research
Click here to watch Congressman Yoder
discussing research funding with The Science
Coalition.
As University of Kansas Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little notes in her
guest editorial to
Roll Call , I do believe that investments
in scientific research should be a bipartisan priority. We must work
together to reduce wasteful spending and create a more efficient federal
government in order to ensure federal funding for this type of
research may continue for generations of innovators to come.

Fact of the Week
Only 41% of Americans support President
Obama's use of executive orders to implement his policy changes on
