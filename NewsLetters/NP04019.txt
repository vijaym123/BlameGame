Congressman Lamborn's VA Clinic Naming Bill Passes Senate and Heads
for the President's Desk
12/3/14
Last night, the
Senate passed Congressman Doug Lamborn's legislation naming the new
Colorado Springs VA Clinic after PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom. PFC Lindstrom
was a Colorado Springs native who gave his life serving the country
in World War II and is a Medal of Honor
recipient.
Ensuring that our veterans have access
to convenient, comprehensive healthcare has always been a priority of
mine.
It was an honor to partner with so many Southern Colorado
veterans to help bring a fantastic new Colorado Springs Community
Based Outpatient Clinic for our veterans. Today, the facility is complete.
The Senate, thanks to the efforts of my colleague Senator Udall, has
passed my bill designating the new clinic as the PFC Floyd K.
Lindstrom Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.
PFC Lindstrom was
posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during
WWII and is one of the Fifth Congressional Districts
and the nations
greatest heroes.
He is buried in Colorado Springs at the
Evergreen Cemetery and I can think of no one more deserving of this
honor.
I want to thank Brian Binn and the Colorado Springs CBOC Naming
Committee and everyone else who worked so hard to make this happen.
