Veterans Day is an opportunity for all Americans to
thank the veterans in our lives for our freedom. May we also take
time to reflect on the on the sacrifices of our POW/MIAs as we
diligently work to bring them home.
Our Veterans are as diverse as
the nation and are a manifestation of the motto reflected on the Great
Seal of the United States, out of many one.
To all
of those who have served, thank you. We salute you.
