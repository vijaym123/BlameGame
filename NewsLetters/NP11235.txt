Crisis in Ukraine
Today,
Senator Corker called on President Obama to begin imposing sanctions
against Russian state-owned enterprises that were authorized yesterday
in his executive order.
The presidents additional U.S.
sanctions announced yesterday were appropriate steps, and he should
target a number of state-owned companies to send shock waves into
Russias economy, demonstrating to the Putin regime that this is just the
beginning if they intervene further in Ukraine, said
Corker.
On Monday, the senator said the administrations calibrated actions
have failed to affect Vladimir Putins decisions, and that has to
change. We should pass the bipartisan Senate bill to assist Ukraine, he
added.
Last Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee passed bipartisan legislation by a vote of 14-3 in response to the
crisis in Ukraine. Read more

Open Air Burn Pit
Registry
In a letter to U.S. Department of Veteran
Affairs (VA) Secretary Eric K. Shinseki this week, Senator Corker pressed
the VA for answers regarding its failure to diligently and
expeditiously implement the Open Air Burn Pit Registry as mandated under Section
201 of PL 112-260, which he coauthored and introduced in
2011.
As you know from previous correspondence on this matter, the
Open Air Burn Pit Registry was designed to identify and monitor
veterans who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and who were exposed to toxic
pollutants released by open air burn pits, Corker wrote. This delay
is deeply concerning, particularly when similar registries exist
within the United States government. The lack of urgency and communication
from the VA is even more troubling. Our veterans, Congress, and the
public deserve to know why the Open Air Burn Pit Registry has been
delayed and when it will be completed.
On January 10, 2013,
President Barack Obama signed PL 112-260 into law. The law provided
the VA one year to develop, implement, and maintain an open burn pit
registry of service members and veterans who may have been exposed to
toxic chemicals and fumes from open air burn pits in Iraq and
Afghanistan. The registry has not yet been established. Read more

Senator Corkers staff will hold Senate at Your Service
events at various locations across Tennessee in the coming months. Corkers

Congress
Should Consider Clear Consequences for Any Iranian Violations of Nuclear
Agreement
Senator Corker, ranking member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following
statement on Tuesday regarding reports that Irans daily oil exports
continue to rise and could result in a violation of the terms negotiated in
the Joint Plan of Action, an agreement between Iran, the United States
and five other world powers to try to dissuade Iran from pursuing a
nuclear weapon.
Recent press reports indicate that as
nuclear negotiations resume in Vienna, Iranian oil exports may be
on-track to exceed the terms of the interim deal and other nations are
beginning to explore longer-term economic relationships with Iran, said
Corker. These developments undermine the international consensus to
prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. While I support the
negotiations over Irans nuclear weapons program, Congress should consider
clear consequences for Iran should they violate the Joint Plan of Action
and move to ensure the president cannot grant sanctions relief as part
of any final deal without congressional approval.
The
Joint Plan of Action limits Irans oil exports to an average of one
million barrels per day over the six months the interim deal is in
effect, which began on January 20, 2014. Read more
