Despite an Unaccomplished Congress,
We Got Things DONE in 2013
Dear Friend,
We came to Washington to work with Democrats and Republicans alike to
change the way we do politics, put people back to work, end costly wars
of choice, and start reinvesting and rebuilding America. Congress
itself was historically unproductive in 2013, in part because so many
members spent more time raising money than governing. Rather than
fundraising while in Washington, I chose to devote my time to
bipartisan efforts in Congress to accomplish goals, solve problems, and
get things done.
Home in Minnesota's 8th, we've been extraordinarily busy.
I've spent hundreds of hours and thousands of miles of windshield time
visiting businesses and manufacturers as part of our "Make it in
America" tour - while taking part in scores of local events, public
forums, and meetings with people from all walks of life.
My staff has held some 250 Congress Comes to You meetings in
communities throughout our 18 sprawling counties.
During our first year in office, we helped hundreds of individuals and
families resolve problems with federal agencies and programs such as
Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, and immigration.
In addition to the billions of dollars our Congressional delegation
helped return to Minnesota last year, my staff and I worked with local
governments, schools, and community organizations to add more than $60
million in specific grants to 8th District airports, harbors, schools,
roads, public buildings, and environmental projects. Of particular
note, we secured $10 million for Duluth International Airport and $3
million to help clean up damaged portions of the St. Louis River.
And speaking of our northern Minnesota lakes, rivers and waterways, my
Invasive Species amendment to the Water Resources Reform & Development
Act (WRRDA) closes the St. Anthony Lock & Dam in Minneapolis,
protecting our multi-billion dollar sport fishing and tourist industry
from Asian Carp that voraciously destroy native species.
I'm especially proud of our role in bringing MnDOT, EPA, and the
Federal Highway Administration together to help resolve the highly
contentious Highway 53 relocation project on the Iron Range, advance a
solution with respect to the Highway 169 Eagle's Nest corridor, and
promote timely reduction of haze over the Boundary Waters and Voyageurs
National Park.
I am striving to balance the need to protect our precious northern
Minnesota environment while advancing the jobs in mining, forestry,
tourism, and economic development we so urgently require. The big three
- taconite, timber, and tourism - plus manufacturing, shipping, and
agriculture, have always been the backbone of our 8th District economy.
This special edition of the Monday Report looks back on some of our
most significant efforts to move this great nation forward.
Ever the optimist, I look forward to a year in which we can hopefully
put aside partisanship and continue to work together for the common
good. With that in mind, I want to thank Minnesota Senators Amy
Klobuchar and Al Franken, and my Minnesota colleagues on the House
side, Betty McCollum, Collin Peterson, Tim Walz, Keith Ellison, Erik
Paulsen, Michelle Bachmann, and John Kline, for their assistance in
2013. It's a pleasure to work with all of them.
As always, I value and welcome your ideas, opinions and wise counsel.
And I wish you a happy, healthy and productive 2014.
Sincerely,

Preventing War with Syria
Our successful bipartisan efforts in preventing a war in Syria without
Congressional approval
were featured in an article in TIME magazine.
>From Vietnam to Afghanistan, I have worked to end expensive,
destructive wars of choice. Last summer, with the U.S. poised to attack
Syria, I helped prevent one.
In a nationally-noted conference call with Secretary of State John
Kerry, I suggested the Administration was experiencing "historical
amnesia" by assuming that a strike against Syria would have no lasting
consequences for the United States - and pointed out that America has
no friends in a Syrian civil war arising from centuries of sectarian
conflict.
Then, working with House and Senate Democrats and Republicans, we
introduced legislation calling on the Administration to abide by the
Constitution and seek Congressional approval for any act of war against
Syria. Public opinion swung overwhelmingly in our favor, and a terrible
and costly war was averted with a diplomatic solution to remove
chemical weapons from that nation.
_____
Overturning Citizens United
Once and for all - corporations are NOT people and money is NOT free
speech.
Early in 2013, I introduced a resolution calling for a Constitutional
Amendment to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision
that allows big corporations and special interests to attempt to
influence our democracy and corrupt our public policy process with
billions of outside, undisclosed dollars. As a result, Members of
Congress often spend more time fundraising than governing. Overturning
Citizens United will be a long, tough battle, but well worth it for our
nation's future.
_____
Getting Congress Back to Work
Watch me call upon the Speaker of the House to return to "Regular
Order" in 2014
While we continue efforts to overturn Citizens United, Congress itself
needs to get back to work full time, engaging the committee process,
debating legislation on the Floor of the House, and accomplishing
things for the American people. It's a process we call "Regular Order" -
a change I have repeatedly called on our Leadership to reinstitute. As
I told the Speaker in my last Floor speech of 2013
, this has been the most unaccomplished
Congress in history. That needs to change in 2014.
_____
Rebuilding America: Reinvesting in our Homeland
In an effort to redirect America's priorities homeward - away from
wildly expensive and wasteful nation-building abroad where it's neither
wanted nor needed - I introduced an amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act to remove $60 billion from the budget for foreign
infrastructure projects. I proposed to re-invest those dollars,
creating good-paying American jobs rebuilding our own crumbling roads,
bridges, waterways, parks, and public buildings.
$60 billion is exactly the amount the Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction, John F. Sopko, reports to have been wasted
in Afghanistan on infrastructure projects never begun, never completed,
or blown up by the Taliban.
Going forward with Special Inspector General Sopko, I have undertaken a
bipartisan effort to prevent $24 billion additional taxpayer dollars
from being sent to Afghanistan - which Mr. Sopko declares to be the
most corrupt "narco-nation" in the world.
_____
Promoting Jobs & Investment
for Cirrus and America's Small Aircraft Industry
Senator Amy Klobuchar and I led successful passage of the bipartisan
Small Airplane Revitalization Act, streamlining the regulatory process
for what promises to be a whole new generation of high-tech airplanes
produced by Cirrus Aircraft in Duluth and others. I am proud to say
President Obama signed the bill into law this fall.
Cumbersome and outdated regulations designed for large airplane
manufacturers have been holding back new technology and investment in
America's small aircraft industry for many years - a situation we fixed
in 2013.
_____
Battling Invasive Species:
Promoting Fishing, Tourism, and Great Lakes Commerce
Why is my amendment closing the St. Anthony Lock & Dam in Minneapolis
so crucial to protecting our multi-billion dollar northern Minnesota
sports fishing and tourism industry from invasive Asian Carp?
Because failure to stop Asian Carp at St. Anthony would have left the
door wide open for these terribly destructive predators - voracious
consumers of native fish and their food sources - to invade the Upper
Mississippi watershed and its tributaries including the Rum River and
Mille Lacs Lake, the Pine River and the Whitefish chain, the Gull River
and Gull Lake chain, the Crow Wing and Crow Wing chain of lakes, and
numerous other chains of lakes big and small including Leech, Cass and
Winnibigoshish. Clearly, the consequences of an Asian Carp invasion
would be devastating for fishing and tourism.
In addition to helping protect northern Minnesota lakes and waterways
from Asian Carp and other invasive species, my amendments to the
massive Water Resources Reform & Development Act (WRRDA in the
Washington language of acronyms) will eventually drive billions of
dollars in additional commerce through the Port of Duluth and up the
Great Lakes system.
Specifically, my invasive species amendments (1) close the St. Anthony
Lock & Dam in Minneapolis; and (2) expand the definition of invasive
species to give the Army Corps of Engineers more power to research and
battle non-native animals as well as plants throughout Minnesota, the
Great Lakes, and the nation.
The Great Lakes amendments: (1) prohibit raids on the Harbor Trust
Funds for purposes other than harbor maintenance; and (2) treat the
Great Lakes as a single waterway system, opening the door for funds
necessary to end a 10-year dredging backlog and allow cargo ships to
operate at 100% of capacity once again.
_____
Advancing an Urgently Needed Farm Bill
In addition to important reforms to the dairy program and other
provisions to assist small farms and rural communities, the House
version of the 2013-14 Farm Bill contains a bipartisan amendment I
helped write to abolish a wasteful and duplicative catfish inspection
program set to cost taxpayers $170 million over the next 10 years - and
burden local companies like Morey's and Trident in Motley with
expensive and unnecessary regulations. I was also able to include
amendments to help promote and expand the wood products and timber
industry so important to northern Minnesota.
The Farm Bill is currently in House-Senate conference committee, where
I am working with Minnesota conferees Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tim
Walz, and Rep. Collin Peterson to minimize or eliminate unnecessary and
harmful cuts to the SNAP nutrition program to assist those in need.
_____
Fixing the Broken Treaty of 1854:
The Fond du Lac-Carlton County Land Swap
With strong bipartisan support, the House passed my bill authorizing
the long-awaited land swap between the Fond du Lac Band of Lake
Superior Chippewa and Carlton County.
It's a partial fix to the broken treaty of 1854, when settlers were
allowed to stay illegally on lands ceded to the Band by the Federal
government. The swap returns original territory to the Band in exchange
for acres of equal value. As a result, the Band will have land they
need to expand tribal housing, and the county will acquire valuable
timber resources. Senator Al Franken is shepherding the bill through
the Senate.
_____
Common Sense for Congress: No Government - No Pay
When Congress fails to do its job and the federal government shuts down
as it did last fall, Members should not be paid. When I introduced the
No Government - No Pay Act of 2013, thousands of people sent messages
of support, the news went viral, suddenly everyone was paying
attention, and internal pressure on Members of Congress to end the
shutdown intensified.
The bill would assure Members of Congress are treated like other
Americans. You do your job, or you don't get paid. The shut down is
over, but we are continuing to build support. Hopefully, there will
never be another stupid, expensive shutdown to force the issue further.

Our Daughters Are Not for Sale:
Battling the Scourge of Sex Trafficking
"Our Daughters Are Not for Sale" - click the image above to read my
op-ed with Rep. Ted Poe in USA Today
Republican Congressman (and former Judge) Ted Poe of Texas and I -
along with a number of others in the House and Senate - have introduced
bills that work together to deal squarely with an epidemic of sex
trafficking that places some 290,000 young American women at risk every
day, according to the Justice Department. We are determined to change
laws and policies to assure that victims are treated as victims, with
all the help, counsel, and support we can provide, and that
perpetrators are treated as the criminals they are, to be punished
under the full weight of law.
Sex trafficking is modern day slavery, and it affects communities from
Duluth to Minneapolis, New York to Los Angeles, and most everywhere in
between. We are determined to end it in our great nation.
_____
Coming Up in Washington
The 2nd session of the 113th Congress officially begins tomorrow.
Here's some of what we can expect to be voting on this week:
*	H.R.3628, the Transportation Reports Elimination Act - Good
housekeeping of the sort that Congress seldom does. This bipartisan
bill, which I supported in the House Transportation & Infrastructure
Committee, consolidates over two decades of annual committee reports,
eliminating what is outdated and archiving what is relevant.
*	H.R.724, a bill I cosponsored to amend the Clean Air Act - This
removes a cumbersome and outdated regulation (requiring dealer
certification of light-duty motor vehicles) while still assuring that
vehicles comply with the strict requirements of the Clean Air Act.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Despite
an
Unaccomplished
Congress, We
Got
Things
DONE
in
2013
Dear
Friend,
We
came
to
Washington
to
work
with
Democrats
and
Republicans
alike
to
change
the
way
we
do
politics,
put
people
back
to
work,
end
costly
wars
of
choice,
and
start
reinvesting
and
rebuilding
America.
Congress
itself
was
historically
unproductive
in
2013,
in
part
because
so
many
members
spent
more
time
raising
money
than
governing.
Rather
than
fundraising
while
in
Washington,
I
chose
to
devote
my
time
to
bipartisan
efforts
in
Congress
to
accomplish
goals,
solve
problems,
and
get
things
done.
Home
in
Minnesota&#8217;s
8th,
we&#8217;ve
been
extraordinarily
busy.
I&#8217;ve
spent
hundreds
of
hours
and
thousands
of
miles
of
windshield
time
visiting
businesses
and
manufacturers
as
part
of
our
"Make
it
in
America"
tour
&#8211;
while
taking
part
in
scores
of
local
events,
public
forums,
and
meetings
with
people
from
all
walks
of
life.
My
staff
has
held
some
250
Congress
Comes
to
You
meetings
in
communities
throughout
our
18
sprawling
counties.
During
our
first
year
in
office,
we
helped
hundreds
of
individuals
and
families
resolve
problems
with
federal
agencies
and
programs
such
as
Social
Security,
Medicare,
veterans
benefits,
and
immigration.
In
addition
to the
billions
of
dollars our
Congressional
delegation
helped
return
to
Minnesota
last
year,
my
staff
and
I
worked
with
local
governments,
schools,
and
community
organizations
to
add
more
than
$60
million
in
specific
grants
to
8th
District
airports,
harbors,
schools,
roads,
public
buildings,
and
environmental
projects .
Of
particular
note,
we
secured
$10
million
for
Duluth
International
Airport
and
$3
million
to
help
clean
up
damaged
portions
of
the
St.
Louis
River .
And
speaking
of
our
northern
Minnesota
lakes,
rivers
and
waterways,
my
Invasive
Species
amendment
to
the
Water
Resources
Reform
&amp;
Development
Act
(WRRDA)
closes
the
St.

in
Minneapolis,
protecting
our
multi-billion
dollar
sport
fishing
and
tourist
industry
from
Asian
Carp
that
voraciously
destroy
native
species.
I&#8217;m
especially
proud
of
our
role
in
bringing
MnDOT,
EPA,
and
the
Federal
Highway
Administration
together
to
help
resolve
the
highly
contentious
Highway
53
relocation
project
on
the
Iron
Range,
advance
a
solution
with
respect
to
the
Highway
169
Eagle&#8217;s
Nest
corridor,
and
promote
timely
reduction
of
haze
over
the
Boundary
Waters
and
Voyageurs
National
Park.
I
am
striving
to
balance
the
need
to
protect
our
precious
northern
Minnesota
environment
while
advancing
the
jobs
in
mining,
forestry,
tourism, and
economic
development
we
so
urgently
require.
The
big
three
-
taconite,
timber,
and
tourism
-
plus
manufacturing,
shipping, and
agriculture,
have
always
been
the
backbone
of
our
8th
District
economy.
This
special
edition
of
the
Monday
Report
looks
back
on
some
of
our
most
significant
efforts
to
move
this
great
nation
forward.
Ever
the
optimist,
I
look
forward
to
a
year
in
which
we
can
hopefully
put
aside
partisanship
and
continue
to
work
together
for
the
common
good.
With
that
in
mind,
I
want
to
thank
Minnesota
Senators
Amy
Klobuchar
and
Al
Franken ,
and
my
Minnesota
colleagues
on
the
House
side,
Betty
McCollum,
Collin
Peterson,
Tim
Walz,
Keith
Ellison,
Erik
Paulsen,
Michelle
Bachmann, and
John
Kline ,
for
their
assistance
in
2013.
It's
a
pleasure
to
work
with
all
of
them.
As
always,
I
value
and
welcome
your
ideas,
opinions
and
wise
counsel.
And
I
wish
you
a
happy,
healthy
and
productive
2014.
Sincerely,
Preventing
War
with
Syria
Our
successful
bipartisan
efforts
in
preventing
a
war
in
Syria
without
Congressional
approval
were
featured
in
an
article
in
TIME
magazine.
From
Vietnam
to
Afghanistan,
I
have
worked
to
end
expensive,
destructive
wars
of
choice.
Last
summer,
with
the
U.S.
poised
to
attack
Syria,
I
helped
prevent
one.
In
a
nationally-noted
conference
call
with
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry ,
I
suggested
the
Administration
was
experiencing
"historical
amnesia"
by
assuming
that
a
strike
against
Syria
would
have
no
lasting
consequences
for
the
United
States
&#8211;
and
pointed
out
that
America
has
no
friends
in
a
Syrian
civil
war
arising
from
centuries
of
sectarian
conflict.
Then,
working
with
House
and
Senate
Democrats
and
Republicans,
we
introduced
legislation
calling
on
the
Administration
to
abide
by
the
Constitution
and
seek
Congressional
approval
for
any
act
of
war
against
Syria .
Public
opinion
swung
overwhelmingly
in
our
favor,
and
a
terrible
and
costly
war
was
averted
with
a
diplomatic
solution
to
remove
chemical
weapons
from
that
nation.
Overturning
Citizens
United
Once
and
for
all
&#8211;
corporations
are
NOT
people
and
money
is
NOT
free
speech .
Early
in
2013,
I
introduced
a
resolution
calling
for
a
Constitutional
Amendment
to
overturn
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court&#8217;s
Citizens
United
decision
that
allows
big
corporations
and
special
interests
to
attempt
to
influence
our
democracy
and
corrupt
our
public
policy
process
with
billions
of
outside,
undisclosed
dollars.
As
a
result,
Members
of
Congress
often
spend
more
time
fundraising
than
governing.
Overturning
Citizens
United
will
be
a
long,
tough
battle,
but
well
worth
it
for
our
nation&#8217;s
future.
Getting
Congress
Back
to
Work
Watch
me
call
upon
the Speaker
of
the
House
to
return
to
"Regular
Order"
in
2014
While
we
continue
efforts
to
overturn
Citizens
United ,
Congress
itself
needs
to
get
back
to
work
full
time,
engaging
the
committee
process,
debating
legislation
on
the
Floor
of
the
House,
and
accomplishing
things
for
the
American
people.
It&#8217;s
a
process
we
call
" Regular
Order "
&#8211;
a
change
I
have
repeatedly
called
on
our
Leadership
to
reinstitute.
As
I
told
the
Speaker
in
my
last
Floor
speech
of
2013 ,
this
has
been
the
most
unaccomplished
Congress
in
history.
That
needs
to
change
in
2014.
Rebuilding
America:
Reinvesting
in
our
Homeland
In
an
effort
to
redirect
America's
priorities
homeward
-
away
from
wildly
expensive
and wasteful
nation-building
abroad
where
it's
neither
wanted
nor
needed
-
I
introduced
an
amendment
to
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
to
remove
$60
billion
from
the
budget
for
foreign
infrastructure
projects.
I
proposed
to
re-invest
those
dollars,
creating
good-paying
American
jobs
rebuilding
our
own
crumbling
roads,
bridges,
waterways,
parks,
and
public
buildings.
$60
billion
is
exactly
the
amount
the
Special
Inspector
General
for
Afghanistan
Reconstruction,
John
F.
Sopko,
reports
to
have
been
wasted
in
Afghanistan
on
infrastructure
projects
never
begun,
never
completed,
or
blown
up
by
the
Taliban.
Going
forward
with
Special
Inspector
General
Sopko,
I
have
undertaken
a
bipartisan
effort
to
prevent
$24
billion
additional
taxpayer
dollars
from
being
sent
to
Afghanistan
&#8211;
which
Mr. Sopko
declares
to
be
the
most
corrupt
"narco-nation"
in
the
world.
Promoting
Jobs
&amp;
Investment
for
Cirrus
and
America's
Small
Aircraft
Industry
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar
and
I
led
successful
passage
of
the
bipartisan
Small
Airplane
Revitalization
Act ,
streamlining
the
regulatory
process
for
what
promises
to
be
a
whole
new
generation
of
high-tech
airplanes
produced
by
Cirrus
Aircraft
in
Duluth
and
others.
I
am
proud
to
say
President
Obama
signed
the
bill
into
law
this
fall .
Cumbersome
and
outdated
regulations
designed
for
large
airplane
manufacturers
have
been
holding
back
new
technology
and
investment
in
America&#8217;s
small
aircraft
industry
for
many
years
&#8211;
a
situation
we
fixed
in
2013.
Battling
Invasive
Species:
Promoting
Fishing,
Tourism,
and Great
Lakes
Commerce
Why
is
my
amendment
closing
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
&amp;
Dam
in
Minneapolis
so
crucial
to
protecting
our
multi-billion
dollar
northern
Minnesota
sports
fishing
and
tourism
industry
from
invasive
Asian
Carp ?
Because
failure
to
stop
Asian
Carp
at
St.
Anthony
would
have
left
the
door
wide
open
for
these
terribly
destructive
predators
-
voracious
consumers
of
native
fish
and
their
food
sources
-
to
invade
the
Upper
Mississippi
watershed
and
its
tributaries
including
the
Rum
River
and
Mille
Lacs
Lake,
the
Pine
River
and
the
Whitefish
chain,
the
Gull
River
and
Gull
Lake
chain,
the
Crow
Wing
and
Crow
Wing
chain
of
lakes,
and
numerous
other
chains
of
lakes
big
and
small
including
Leech,
Cass
and
Winnibigoshish.
Clearly,
the
consequences
of
an
Asian
Carp
invasion
would
be
devastating
for
fishing
and
tourism.
In
addition
to
helping
protect
northern
Minnesota
lakes
and
waterways
from
Asian
Carp
and
other
invasive
species,
my
amendments
to
the
massive
Water
Resources
Reform
&amp;
Development
Act
(WRRDA
in
the
Washington
language
of
acronyms)
will
eventually
drive
billions
of
dollars
in
additional
commerce
through
the
Port
of
Duluth
and
up
the
Great
Lakes
system.
Specifically,
my
invasive
species
amendments
(1)
close
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
&amp;
Dam
in
Minneapolis;
and
(2)
expand
the
definition
of
invasive
species
to
give
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
more
power
to
research
and
battle
non-native
animals
as
well
as
plants
throughout
Minnesota,
the
Great
Lakes, and
the
nation.
The
Great
Lakes
amendments :
(1)
prohibit
raids
on
the
Harbor
Trust
Funds
for
purposes
other
than
harbor

treat
the
Great
Lakes
as
a
single
waterway
system,
opening
the
door
for
funds
necessary
to
end

10-year

Advancing
an
Urgently
Needed
Farm
Bill
In
addition
to
important
reforms
to
the
dairy
program
and
other
provisions
to
assist
small
farms
and
rural
communities,
the
House
version
of
the
2013-14
Farm
Bill
contains
a
bipartisan
amendment
I
helped
write
to
abolish
a
wasteful
and
duplicative
catfish
inspection
program
set
to
cost
taxpayers
$170
million
over
the
next
10
years
&#8211;
and
burden
local
companies
like
Morey&#8217;s
and
Trident
in
Motley
with
expensive
and
unnecessary
regulations.
I
was
also
able
to
include
amendments
to
help
promote
and
expand
the
wood
products
and
timber
industry
so
important
to
northern
Minnesota.
The
Farm
Bill
is
currently
in
House-Senate
conference
committee,
where
I
am
working
with
Minnesota
conferees
Sen.
Amy
Klobuchar,
Rep.
Tim
Walz,
and
Rep.
Collin
Peterson
to
minimize
or
eliminate
unnecessary
and
harmful
cuts
to
the
SNAP
nutrition
program
to
assist
those
in
need.
Fixing
the
Broken
Treaty
of
1854: The
Fond
du
Lac-Carlton
County
Land
Swap
With
strong
bipartisan
support,
the
House
passed
my
bill
authorizing
the
long-awaited
land
swap
between
the
Fond
du
Lac
Band
of
Lake
Superior
Chippewa
and
Carlton
County .
It&#8217;s
a
partial
fix
to
the
broken
treaty
of
1854,
when
settlers
were
allowed
to
stay
illegally
on
lands
ceded
to
the
Band
by
the
Federal
government.
The
swap
returns
original
territory
to
the
Band
in
exchange
for
acres
of
equal
value.
As
a
result,
the
Band
will
have
land
they
need
to
expand
tribal
housing,
and
the
county
will
acquire
valuable
timber
resources.
Senator
Al
Franken
is
shepherding
the
bill
through
the
Senate.
Common
Sense
for
Congress:
No
Government
-
No
Pay
When
Congress
fails
to
do
its
job
and
the
federal
government
shuts
down
as
it
did
last
fall,
Members
should
not
be
paid.
When
I
introduced
the
No
Government
-
No
Pay
Act
of
2013,
thousands
of
people
sent
messages
of
support,
the
news
went
viral,
suddenly
everyone
was
paying
attention,
and
internal
pressure
on
Members
of
Congress
to
end
the
shutdown
intensified.
The
bill
would
assure
Members
of
Congress
are
treated
like
other
Americans.
You
do
your
job,
or
you
don&#8217;t
get
paid .
The
shut
down
is
over,
but
we
are
continuing
to
build
support.
Hopefully,
there
will
never
be
another
stupid,
expensive
shutdown
to
force
the
issue
further.

my
op-ed
with
Rep.
Ted
Poe
in
USA
Today
Republican
Congressman
(and
former
Judge)
Ted
Poe
of
Texas
and
I
-
along
with
a
number
of
others
in
the
House
and
Senate
-
have
introduced
bills
that
work
together
to
deal
squarely
with
an
epidemic
of
sex
trafficking
that
places
some
290,000
young
American
women
at
risk
every
day ,
according
to
the
Justice
Department.
We
are
determined
to
change
laws
and
policies
to
assure
that
victims
are
treated
as
victims,
with
all
the
help,
counsel,
and
support
we
can
provide,
and
that
perpetrators
are
treated
as
the
criminals
they
are,
to
be
punished
under
the
full
weight
of
law.
Sex
trafficking
is
modern
day
slavery ,
and
it
affects
communities
from
Duluth
to
Minneapolis,
New
York
to
Los
Angeles,
and
most
everywhere
in
between.
We
are
determined
to
end
it
in
our
great
nation.
Coming
Up
in
Washington
The
2nd
session
of
the
113th
Congress
officially
begins
tomorrow.
Here's
some
of
what
we
can
expect
to
be
voting
on
this
week:
H.R.3628,
the
Transportation
Reports
Elimination
Act
-
Good
housekeeping
of
the
sort
that
Congress
seldom
does.
This
bipartisan
bill,
which
I
supported
in
the
House
Transportation
&amp;
Infrastructure
Committee,
consolidates
over
two
decades
of
annual
committee
reports,
eliminating
what
is
outdated
and
archiving
what
is
relevant.
H.R.724,
a
bill
I
cosponsored
to
amend
the
Clean
Air
Act
-
This
removes
a
cumbersome
and
outdated
regulation
(requiring
dealer
certification
of
light-duty
motor
vehicles)
while
still
assuring
that
vehicles
comply
with
the
strict
requirements
of
the
Clean
Air
Act.
Finally
-
