WEEK IN REVIEW
On Tuesday, I headed over
to St. Joseph Catholic School to participate in its National Blue
Ribbon School celebration! St. Joseph is one of five schools in the state
(and one of two in the Third District) to receive the Blue Ribbon
award, and it is only the third private school in Arkansas and
notably
the first in NWA to receive the award throughout the program's
32-year history. Congratulations to the faculty, students, and families of
St. Joseph School!
You can
read about
the celebration here . I also applaud Eastside Elementary
School in Rogers, the only other school in Northwest Arkansas to
receive this prestigious recognition.
Well done!
I also swung by Vermeer Midsouth, a
full-service equipment dealer that specializes in selling and leasing
Vermeer environmental, trenchless, and utility equipment! Thanks for
showing me around your Springdale location.
On Wednesday, Northwest
Arkansas lost Mike Dunaway
a committed community leader, a golf legend, and
my good friend. He will certainly be missed by the many whose lives
he made better throughout our community. My thoughts and prayers are
with his family.
This
morning, I joined participants of the Illinois River Watershed
Partnership (IRWP) Conference at Crystal Bridges. This conference has been an
opportunity to bring together a diverse group of stakeholders to
achieve a balance between environmental stewardship and sustainable growth
in the Illinois River Watershed. I understand this can be
challenging, especially in our unique situation, as most of our population is
centered at the headwaters of a watershed. But the story of Northwest
Arkansas is told in the lives of ingenious people who see challenges and
overcome them with creativity, drive and determination, and I commend
the partnership for proactively engaging and seeking solutions for the
region.
Finally, Id like to wish all of those observing Yom
Kippur an easy fast.
Looking forward to seeing many of you next week as I travel around the
district!
From the Front...
