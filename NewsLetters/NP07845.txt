Friend -
I believe that we should work to reduce the federal footprint in education by eliminating strict standards and penalties, and putting control back in the hands of state and local leaders.
The responsibility for student achievement is best handled by the states and individual school districts, thereby enhancing local flexibility, protecting taxpayers investments in education, and strengthening state and local autonomy.
Im supporting a bill,
H.Res.476 , which strongly denounces the President's coercion of states into adopting the Common Core standards, and restores and protects state authority and flexibility in establishing and defining student academic standards and assessments.
Yours in service,
Randy
