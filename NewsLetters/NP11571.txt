DISTRICT
Dear Friend,
April in Washington, D.C.
is a great time of year. Spring shows up in full force and the famous
cherry blossoms begin to bloom around the National Mall. And this year,
on April 9th , I will be hosting the Nineteenth
Annual Third District Day on Capitol Hill.
Third District Day,
a Legislative Issues Seminar, was started almost two decades ago on
Capitol Hill to engage public officials, community and business
leaders, and interested citizens from the communities that make up the Third
Congressional District.
Third District Day is a
meaningful day-long seminar that provides in-depth insight on a wide variety of
issues facing our District and our country. Past speakers have
included George Stephanopoulos, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Army Chief of
Staff General Ray Odierno, Judy Woodruff, the late-Senator Ted Kennedy,
and Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Speakers scheduled to appear this
year include:
David Gregory, anchor of NBC
News Meet the Press
Congressman Adam
Smith, the highest ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee
Luke Russert, NBC News
correspondent
Ted Leonsis, owner of the
Washington Capitals and Washington
Wizards
Edward Davis,
former Boston Police
Commissioner
Holly Petraeus,
Director of Servicemember Affairs at the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau
General James F. Amos,
Commandant of the U.S. Marine
Corps
Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed
Markey
U.S. Representatives from Massachusetts
and elsewhere
An official welcome event will
be held on the evening of
Tuesday, April 8th, 2014.
Third District Day itself will be held on
Wednesday,
April 9th
in the Gold Room, located in the Rayburn House Office
Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The program will start
promptly at 8:30am and run to approximately 2:00pm.
This is
an open invitation and I encourage you to join us for this unique
opportunity to interact with key congressional lawmakers, media
personalities and administration officials and see firsthand how the Capitol
works.

Day, or to RSVP to both events, please visit my website at:

POTUS
BUDGET
Last week, President Obama released his FY2015 budget,
which is aimed at creating long-term economic security and expanding
opportunities for all Americans. By closing special interest tax
loopholes, the budget cuts taxes for 13.5 million working Americans and
invests in education and domestic job creation. It expands the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit, establishes auto-IRAs
to help workers save for their future, and provides tax relief that
helps students pay for college.
While I dont agree with all
of the choices in the budget, and will be working with my colleagues
to restore funding for critical programs like LIHEAP and CDBG, I
applaud the President for putting forward strong proposals and
demonstrating that we can responsibly invest in growing our economy while
rewarding hardworking
Americans.
JSTARS AT HANSCOM AFB
President Obamas budget proposal
also makes a significant investment in a major military program run out
of Massachusetts Hanscom Air Force Base.
The Joint
Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) has become one of the
most reliable surveillance systems in the world, providing unparalleled
reconnaissance resources and efficient communications capabilities. The
FY2015 budget commits $73 million in funding to establish a new
platform for JSTARS. The new program will be run out of Hanscom
AFB.
Headquartering the JSTARS recapitalization program at Hanscom
continues the installations role in developing some of the most
cutting edge military technology and hi-tech resources.

FLOOD
INSURANCE VOTE
On March 4, the House of
Representatives passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability
Act.
As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, and with several
major waterways crisscrossing my district, I have long been an
advocate for preserving our natural resources and also supporting those who
live and work around them. I have heard from many concerned residents
in the region and joined with the entire Massachusetts Delegation
urging action to help maintain affordable flood
insurance.
Although far from a perfect bill, I voted in support because it will
provide some relief to homeowners who reside near Third District rivers
and around Massachusetts and are currently seeing high rate
increases.
