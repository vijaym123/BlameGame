David -- this is my second email tonight asking you for $5.
I have no choice at this point. We&rsquo;re 8 days out from Election Day. An election in which we can shock Republicans in deep-red districts -- if we have the resources we need to do it.
So I&rsquo;m pleading with you --
can you make sure we reach our goal for tomorrow&rsquo;s big deadline by giving $5 or more today? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
I&rsquo;m not going to go on and on about how important this election is. You already know how important it is. You&rsquo;ve already heard that from President Clinton and President Obama.
I&rsquo;m just going to tell you the cold math that we have to deal with right now: we have a huge ad buy deadline tomorrow night, and we&rsquo;re coming up $275,OOO short.
Please, David. Keep the hopes of our Democratic campaigns alive and give $5 or more right now: https://action.dccc.org/Chip-In
