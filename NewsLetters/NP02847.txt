Kansas Common Sense
February 9, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
The President's Budget Continues Fiscal Irresponsibility
This week, President Obama delivered his fiscal year 2016 budget to
Congress. With complete disregard for the message sent by the American
people in November, the proposal includes a staggering $2.1 trillion in
new tax increases and would add $8.5 trillion to the national debt.
I will examine and evaluate the specific provisions of the President's
proposal, and I will work to shape a federal budget that funds the
government's responsibilities while promoting a job-creating
environment. Especially when resources are scarce with an increasingly
dangerous world, we must better prioritize spending to make certain our
economy is growing and our citizens are well protected. American safety
and prosperity calls for serious policy - unfortunately, the
President's plan falls well short.
VA Budget Request Threatens Choice Act
Just six months after the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability
Act of 2014 (Choice Act) was signed into law - and only three months
after Choice Cards were mailed to veterans - the VA's Fiscal Year 2016
budget request released this week proposes reallocating the law's
emergency funds that are solely meant to pay for veteran health care to
support other "investments in the VA System priorities." This week I
vented my frustration on the Senate floor with what I see as the
Department of Veterans Affairs continuing to overlook what is in the
best interest of veterans.
When Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to pass the Choice
Act, we told veterans they would now have a choice when it comes to
their health care - that many would have the option of seeing their
local physician. I believe the VA's assertion that veterans are using
the Choice Program at a lower rate than anticipated because they prefer
being treated by the VA could not be farther from the truth. A new
national poll released this week by Concerned Veterans for America
found that 88 percent of veterans believe the VA needs to increase
healthcare choices for veterans including access to their local
community providers.
Thousands of veterans, including Kansans who have shared their stories
with me, are struggling to access care through the Choice Act primarily
because of VA's flawed implementation and interpretation of the law.
These errors include delays in mailing out Choice Cards, disqualifying
veterans who should be eligible without explanation, and dramatically
narrowing the scope of veterans who can use these funds by unreasonably
calculating how far a veteran lives from a VA medical facility, not
whether that facility can actually provide the medical services a
veteran needs.
These issues must be fixed. I've introduced legislation, the Veterans
Access to Community Care Act of 2015 (S. 207), requiring the VA to
utilize its authorities, including the Choice Act, to offer community
care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the healthcare
services they need from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of where
they live. By choosing to not use their authorities, the VA is forcing
many rural Kansas veterans to travel hours to access care they could
receive through the Choice Act in their communities - or go without
care altogether.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations and Veterans' Affairs
Committees, I spoke with Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel on Wednesday
about how I will work to make certain the VA puts the needs of veterans
before their own self-interest. These funds must benefit those they
were intended to serve - our nation's veterans. Click here
to see my floor speech. Click here

Cavuto.
Clay Hunt Legislation Heads to President's Desk
I am pleased the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act this week. As a sponsor of this
bill and a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Member, I am proud this
legislation will soon be signed into law.
The average suicide rate among veterans is a staggering 22 deaths each
day. This bill will help develop a VA system capable of offering
first-rate mental health care services, as well as utilize the
expertise of outside organizations to provide support for those
returning home and struggling with the invisible wounds of war. I can
think of no better way to honor the memory of Clay Hunt, a Marine
veteran who committed suicide in March 2011 at the age of 28.
During a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing in last fall, I had
the opportunity to learn about his compelling story of sacrifice for
our country and struggle with the VA from Clay's mom, Susan Selke. No
mother, father or family member should suffer the loss of their loved
one because of failures in the VA health care system. President Obama
should take quick action in signing this important legislation so the
VA has the ability to care for our suffering service members who are
not receiving the care they need. Click here

Representing Kansas Aviation on Capitol Hill
I was selected to serve as a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee
on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security for the 114th Congress.
This subcommittee oversees civil aviation, with oversight
responsibility of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Specifically, the subcommittee monitors FAA's grant making efforts in
funding airport infrastructure projects and upgrades to air traffic
control facilities, in addition to its jurisdiction over domestic
aviation security, which includes the majority of the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) workforce.
General aviation is the largest industry in Kansas, generating nearly
$3 billion in annual exports and producing 40 percent of all general
aviation planes. For many individuals and businesses in rural Kansas,
it is also the most reliable means of connecting with the rest of the
world. I look forward to representing Kansans on this important
subcommittee and working to ensure a safer and more efficient air
traffic system that will allow the aviation industry to continue to
grow and thrive in our great state. Click here

Hosting Hearing on Data Breach Notification and Data Security
On Thursday, I convened my first hearing as Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and
Data Security in the 114th Congress. The hearing was focused on the
very timely and pressing issue of protecting Americans from data
security breaches and how best to notify consumers in the event of a
breach. For more than a decade, Congress has been contemplating issues
surrounding data security and data breach notification. Recent
high-profile data breaches, including what experts are calling the
"largest health care data breach in history" that occurred on the eve
of the hearing, are the latest examples that highlight the ongoing and
serious cyber threats that American businesses and consumers face.
In the decade since Congress held its first hearings examining data
security, no consensus has been reached on the development of national
data security and data breach notification standards. As a result,
states have taken on this task by developing their own standards. As of
today, businesses are subject to a patchwork of more than 50 different
state, district and territory laws that determine how businesses must
notify consumers in the event of a breach incident. In addition, 12
states have enacted laws regarding data security practices. This
spectrum of laws is complicated for businesses and consumers,
especially because many of our nation's companies operate in multiple
states and so much of our nation's businesses is conducted online.
Our expert panel of witnesses mostly agreed that a strong national data
breach notification standard would give consumers the ability to take
measures to protect themselves from financial harm or identity theft.
This hearing helped my colleagues and me gain a better understanding of
how to develop such a standard to help both companies and consumers
when they face data security challenges. Many experts named 2014 the
"Year of the Data Breach." I am hopeful that this hearing will help
Congress make 2015 the "Year of the Data Breach Notification
Legislation." To view a video of the hearing, please click here

National Cotton Council Annual Meeting
Nearly 500 people from across the nation came together this week to
talk about issues important to the cotton industry. I had the
opportunity to give the keynote address to the National Cotton Council
Annual conference, which included every segment of the cotton industry
from cotton farmers to textile manufactures. The cotton industry
remains an important part of our nation and our economy. Farmers
planted more than 30,000 acres of cotton in Kansas last year. Our state
is also home to four cotton gins and a cotton warehouse. I was pleased
to have the opportunity to visit with the large number of Kansans
involved in the industry who attended the meeting this week.
Like every commodity, the cotton industry has challenges unique to
them. However, most of the concerns I heard, such as low crop prices,
international trade barriers, overregulation by the federal government,
and the need for strong support of agriculture research, are concerns
shared by farmers across Kansas and the nation. I appreciated the
invitation to address the conference. As chairman of the Agriculture
Appropriations Subcommittee, I look forward to working to make sure our
policies are helping, not harming, our agriculture industry. And that
we continue to make certain that we give our farmers the opportunity to
make a living and pass on their special way of life and agriculture
heritage to the next generation.
Kansas Health Care Providers Visit Capitol Hill
Kansas hospital administrators, physicians, nurses and medical students
were in Washington for the National Rural Health Association's 26th
Annual Rural Health Policy Institute. This event brings more than 400
rural health professionals and advocates to the nation's capital - the
largest rural advocacy event of the year. It was a pleasure to meet
Eastin Casey of Natoma, Tyler Egbert of McCune and Catie Paliwoda of
Axtel who are in their first year of medical school at the University
of Kansas School of Medicine. They have an interest in practicing
medicine in a rural community. I wish them the best in their studies
and am pleased they are considering practicing medicine in Kansas.
Applications Available for Summer 2015 Internships
I am currently accepting internship applications for my Washington,
D.C. and Kansas offices for summer 2015. An internship, either

The
President's
Budget
Continues
Fiscal
Irresponsibility
This
week,
President
Obama
delivered
his
fiscal
year
2016
budget
to
Congress.
With
complete
disregard
for
the
message
sent
by
the
American
people
in
November,
the
proposal
includes
a
staggering
$2.1
trillion
in
new
tax
increases
and
would
add
$8.5
trillion
to
the
national
debt.
I
will
examine
and
evaluate
the
specific
provisions
of
the
President's
proposal,
and
I
will
work
to
shape
a
federal
budget
that
funds
the
government's
responsibilities
while
promoting
a
job-creating
environment.
Especially
when
resources
are
scarce
with
an
increasingly
dangerous
world,
we
must
better
prioritize
spending
to
make
certain
our
economy
is
growing
and
our
citizens
are
well
protected.
American
safety
and
prosperity
calls
for
serious
policy
&ndash;
unfortunately,
the
President's
plan
falls
well
short.
VA
Budget
Request
Threatens
Choice
Act
Just
six
months
after
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(Choice
Act)
was
signed
into
law
&ndash;
and
only
three
months
after
Choice
Cards
were
mailed
to
veterans
&ndash;
the
VA's
Fiscal
Year
2016
budget
request
released
this
week
proposes
reallocating
the
law's
emergency
funds
that
are
solely
meant
to
pay
for
veteran
health
care
to
support
other
"investments
in
the
VA
System
priorities."
This
week
I
vented
my
frustration
on
the
Senate
floor
with
what
I
see
as
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
continuing
to
overlook
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
veterans.
When
Congress
came
together
on
a
bipartisan
basis
to
pass
the
Choice
Act,
we
told
veterans
they
would
now
have
a
choice
when
it
comes
to
their
health
care
&ndash;
that
many
would
have
the
option
of
seeing
their
local
physician.
I
believe
the
VA's
assertion
that
veterans
are
using
the
Choice
Program
at
a
lower
rate
than
anticipated
because
they
prefer
being
treated
by
the
VA
could
not
be
farther
from
the
truth.
A
new
national
poll
released
this
week
by
Concerned
Veterans
for
America
found
that
88
percent
of
veterans
believe
the
VA
needs
to
increase
healthcare
choices
for
veterans
including
access
to
their
local
community
providers.
Thousands
of
veterans,
including
Kansans
who
have
shared
their
stories
with
me,
are
struggling
to
access
care
through
the
Choice
Act
primarily
because
of
VA's
flawed
implementation
and
interpretation
of
the
law.
These
errors
include
delays
in
mailing
out
Choice
Cards,
disqualifying
veterans
who
should
be
eligible
without
explanation,
and
dramatically
narrowing
the
scope
of
veterans
who
can
use
these
funds
by
unreasonably
calculating
how
far
a
veteran
lives
from
a
VA
medical
facility,
not
whether
that
facility
can
actually
provide
the
medical
services
a
veteran
needs.
These
issues
must
be
fixed.
I've
introduced
legislation,
the
Veterans
Access
to
Community
Care
Act
of
2015
(S.
207),
requiring
the
VA
to
utilize
its
authorities,
including
the
Choice
Act,
to
offer
community
care
to
veterans
who
are
currently
unable
to
receive
the
healthcare
services
they
need
from
a
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
they
live.
By
choosing
to
not
use
their
authorities,
the
VA
is
forcing
many
rural
Kansas
veterans
to
travel
hours
to
access
care
they
could
receive
through
the
Choice
Act
in
their
communities
&ndash;
or
go
without
care
altogether.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
and
Veterans'
Affairs
Committees,
I
spoke
with
Neil
Cavuto
on
Fox
News
Channel
on
Wednesday
about
how
I
will
work
to
make
certain
the
VA
puts
the
needs
of
veterans
before
their
own
self-interest.
These
funds
must
benefit
those
they
were
intended
to
serve
&ndash;
our
nation's
veterans.

Clay
Hunt
Legislation
Heads
to
President's
Desk
I
am
pleased
the
U.S.
Senate
unanimously
passed
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act
this
week.
As
a
sponsor
of
this
bill
and
a
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
Member,
I
am
proud
this
legislation
will
soon
be
signed
into
law.
The
average
suicide
rate
among
veterans
is
a
staggering
22
deaths
each
day.
This
bill
will
help
develop
a
VA
system
capable
of
offering
first-rate
mental
health
care
services,
as
well
as
utilize
the
expertise
of
outside
organizations
to
provide
support
for
those
returning
home
and
struggling
with
the
invisible
wounds
of
war.
I
can
think
of
no
better
way
to
honor
the
memory
of
Clay
Hunt,
a
Marine
veteran
who
committed
suicide
in
March
2011
at
the
age
of
28.
During
a
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
hearing
in
last
fall,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
about
his
compelling
story
of
sacrifice
for
our
country
and
struggle
with
the
VA
from
Clay's
mom,
Susan
Selke.
No
mother,
father
or
family
member
should
suffer
the
loss
of
their
loved
one
because
of
failures
in
the
VA
health
care
system.
President
Obama
should
take
quick
action
in
signing
this
important
legislation
so
the
VA
has
the
ability
to
care
for
our
suffering
service
members
who
are
not
receiving
the
care
they
need.

Representing
Kansas
Aviation
on
Capitol
Hill
I
was
selected
to
serve
as
a
member
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Aviation
Operations,
Safety,
and
Security
for
the
114th
Congress.
This
subcommittee
oversees
civil
aviation,
with
oversight
responsibility
of
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA).
Specifically,
the
subcommittee
monitors
FAA's
grant
making
efforts
in
funding
airport
infrastructure
projects
and
upgrades
to
air
traffic
control
facilities,
in
addition
to
its
jurisdiction
over
domestic
aviation
security,
which
includes
the
majority
of
the
Transportation
Security
Administration
(TSA)
workforce.
General
aviation
is
the
largest
industry
in
Kansas,
generating
nearly
$3
billion
in
annual
exports
and
producing
40
percent
of
all
general
aviation
planes.
For
many
individuals
and
businesses
in
rural
Kansas,
it
is
also
the
most
reliable
means
of
connecting
with
the
rest
of
the
world.
I
look
forward
to
representing
Kansans
on
this
important
subcommittee
and
working
to
ensure
a
safer
and
more
efficient
air
traffic
system
that
will
allow
the
aviation
industry
to
continue
to
grow
and
thrive
in
our
great
state.

Hosting
Hearing
on
Data
Breach
Notification
and
Data
Security
On
Thursday,
I
convened
my
first
hearing
as
Chairman
of
the
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance,
and
Data
Security
in
the
114th
Congress.
The
hearing
was
focused
on
the
very
timely
and
pressing
issue
of
protecting
Americans
from
data
security
breaches
and
how
best
to
notify
consumers
in
the
event
of
a
breach.
For
more
than
a
decade,
Congress
has
been
contemplating
issues
surrounding
data
security
and
data
breach
notification.
Recent
high-profile
data
breaches,
including
what
experts
are
calling
the
"largest
health
care
data
breach
in
history"
that
occurred
on
the
eve
of
the
hearing,
are
the
latest
examples
that
highlight
the
ongoing
and
serious
cyber
threats
that
American
businesses
and
consumers
face.
In
the
decade
since
Congress
held
its
first
hearings
examining
data
security,
no
consensus
has
been
reached
on
the
development
of
national
data
security
and
data
breach
notification
standards.
As
a
result,
states
have
taken
on
this
task
by
developing
their
own
standards.
As
of
today,
businesses
are
subject
to
a
patchwork
of
more
than
50
different
state,
district
and
territory
laws
that
determine
how
businesses
must
notify
consumers
in
the
event
of
a
breach
incident.
In
addition,
12
states
have
enacted
laws
regarding
data
security
practices.
This
spectrum
of
laws
is
complicated
for
businesses
and
consumers,
especially
because
many
of
our
nation's
companies
operate
in
multiple
states
and
so
much
of
our
nation's
businesses
is
conducted
online.
Our
expert
panel
of
witnesses
mostly
agreed
that
a
strong
national
data
breach
notification
standard
would
give
consumers
the
ability
to
take
measures
to
protect
themselves
from
financial
harm
or
identity
theft.
This
hearing
helped
my
colleagues
and
me
gain
a
better
understanding
of
how
to
develop
such
a
standard
to
help
both
companies
and
consumers
when
they
face
data
security
challenges.
Many
experts
named
2014
the
"Year
of
the
Data
Breach."
I
am
hopeful
that
this
hearing
will
help
Congress
make
2015
the
"Year
of
the
Data
Breach
Notification
Legislation."

National
Cotton
Council
Annual
Meeting
Nearly
500
people
from
across
the
nation
came
together
this
week
to
talk
about
issues
important
to
the
cotton
industry.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
give
the
keynote
address
to
the
National
Cotton
Council
Annual
conference,
which
included
every
segment
of
the
cotton
industry
from
cotton
farmers
to
textile
manufactures.
The
cotton
industry
remains
an
important
part
of
our
nation
and
our
economy.
Farmers
planted
more
than
30,000
acres
of
cotton
in
Kansas
last
year.
Our
state
is
also
home
to
four
cotton
gins
and
a
cotton
warehouse.
I
was
pleased
to
have
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
the
large
number
of
Kansans
involved
in
the
industry
who
attended
the
meeting
this
week.
Like
every
commodity,
the
cotton
industry
has
challenges
unique
to
them.
However,
most
of
the
concerns
I
heard,
such
as
low
crop
prices,
international
trade
barriers,
overregulation
by
the
federal
government,
and
the
need
for
strong
support
of
agriculture
research,
are
concerns
shared
by
farmers
across
Kansas
and
the
nation.
I
appreciated
the
invitation
to
address
the
conference.
As
chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
look
forward
to
working
to
make
sure
our
policies
are
helping,
not
harming,
our
agriculture
industry.
And
that
we
continue
to
make
certain
that
we
give
our
farmers
the
opportunity
to
make
a
living
and
pass
on
their
special
way
of
life
and
agriculture
heritage
to
the
next
generation.

they
are
considering
