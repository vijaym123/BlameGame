Will the National Labor
Relations Board Muzzle Elected Officials?
Appearing on CNBCs Squawk Box yesterday
to
discuss Volkswagen Chattanooga workers recent vote against representation
by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, Senator Corker questioned
whether the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will try to muzzle
elected officials from weighing in on issues important to their
communities. Last Friday, February 21, the UAW filed an appeal with the NLRB
regarding the election.

Now this is
going to the National Labor Relations Board, something that the president
controls. The question will be: will they try to muzzle or keep a
United States senator, a governor or a state legislator from being able to
express their views? said Corker. The fact is, if I cannot weigh in
on things that I know to be true, if I cannot weigh in on the
experiences that I've had with the UAW and their path of job destruction in
our community when something like this is being discussed, what can I
do? It's going to be an interesting debate over the next period of time
as to whether the National Labor Relations Board holds to what it has
done for 50 years, that people like me can weigh in, or whether they
will try to muzzle people like me who are trying to look out for their
community."
On February 14, workers at the Volkswagen
Chattanooga plant voted 712-626 against representation by the UAW.
Following the vote, Corker
said : Needless to say, I am
thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and
its future.
Last week, Corker
responded
to the UAWs appeal: The workers at Chattanooga's Volkswagen plant
spoke very clearly last week, so we are disappointed the UAW is
ignoring their decision and has filed this objection. Unfortunately, I have
to assume that today's action may slow down Volkswagens final
discussions on the new SUV line, said Corker. This complaint affirms the
point many of us have been making: that the UAW is only interested in
its own survival and not the interests of the great employees at
Chattanoogas Volkswagen facility nor the company for which they
work.
As mayor of Chattanooga from 2001-2005, Corker worked with
officials and community leaders to develop the 1,200 acre Enterprise South
Industrial Park, which is now home to Volkswagen's North American
manufacturing headquarters. Much of the negotiation that led to Volkswagen
choosing Chattanooga occurred around the dining room table of
Corkers Chattanooga home.

Chattanooga Times Free Press: Bob Corker says NLRB shouldn't 'muzzle'
Congress, state officials
published Tuesday, February
25th, 2014
by Dave Flessner
U.S. Sen. Bob Corker,
R-Tenn., today accused the United Auto Workers union of trying to unfairly
limit what state and federal lawmakers can say about organized labor
during union elections through their appeal of the recent union election
at the Chattanooga Volkswagen plant.
The UAW has accused
Corker and other Republican politicians of creating a climate of fear
and intimidation in their anti-union comments before the election in
which hourly employees at VW voted 712-626 against representation by the
UAW. On Friday, the union asked the National Labor Relations Board to
order a new election because of comments by Corker and others before
the vote warning that union representation might hurt the plant and
the community.
"Now this is going to the NLRB, something that
the president controls," Corker said in an interview today on CNBC.
"The question will be whether they will try to muzzle or keep a United
States Senator, a governor or a state legislator from being able to
express their views."
Corker said he and Tennessee Gov. Bill
Haslam, along with GOP legislative leaders in Nashville, were simply trying
to tell workers their concerns about union representation to counter
the UAW representatives who were allowed to make public presentations
within the VW plant prior to the vote from Feb. 12 to Feb.
14.
"The fact is, if I cannot weigh in and say things that I know to
be true and the experiences that I've had with the UAW and their path
of job destruction in our community when something like this is being
discussed, what can I do?" Corker asked today. "It's going to be an
interesting debate to see if the National Labor Relations Board will hold
to what it has done for 50 years that people like me can weigh in, or
whether they will try to muzzle people like me who are trying to look
out for their community."
Corker said that UAW supporters
were telling workers at VW that a union was needed for the plant to be
expanded and for a sports utility vehicle line to be
added.
"Inside the plant with only the UAW there, they were spreading
rumors rampantly that the only way that the plant was going to be expanded
is if the union won the vote," Corker said. "In that context, with us
having to come over the transom, we wanted to make sure people knew,
in fact, that Chattanooga was the first location (for the SUV line) and
if, in fact, people did vote the union out, Chattanooga was still
going to be the place where the company expected to
expand."
Corker said VW wage rates are already at or above what new workers at
auto plants represented by the UAW are now paid under the union's
two-tiered wage system negotiated during the most recent recession.
Although long-term UAW members are paid more, new workers at UAW plants are
paid comparable wages to what Volkswagen pays in Chattanooga. UAW dues
would take from 2 to 2.5 hours of work a month from each worker that
decides to join the UAW if the union represents the
worker.
Corker said the community also is concerned with the UAW "because we
know we're going to have tremendous difficulties with economic
development down the road if the UAW gets a foothold there."
"They
called me an outsider -- this Detroit-based identity that came into
our community to poach from our workers," Corker
said.
