Dear Friends,
As many of you have heard,
Pastor Saeed Abedini -- an American citizen -- has been imprisoned in Iran
for practicing his Christian faith. As the United States is a beacon
of freedom across the world, we have the responsibility to stand up
for religious freedoms and those being persecuted for their
faith.
I have signed on as a cosponsor of H.Res. 147, which calls for
the release of Pastor Abedini and condemns the government of Iran for
its continued persecution of religious minorities. I've also joined
with 75 of my House colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama
asking him to raise international awareness of the pastor's
plight.
"After being denied any due process, convicted, sentenced and
tortured, Pastor Abedini is now being held in a prison cell with five of
Iran's most violent criminals simply because he has exercised his
inalienable right to practice Christianity. Pastor Abedini's life is in
peril, and this most recent action by Iran warrants a response from the
president. The time is now for you and your administration to raise
international awareness regarding Iran's brazen violation of an
inalienable right which should be extended to every person in the world," we
wrote in our letter to President Obama.
HARDY COUNTY FARMERS
I met this week in Washington with a group of farmers and their
families visiting from Hardy County. After they toured the U.S. Capitol, we
talked about the pending farm and transportation bills.
If
you will be visiting Washington and would like to schedule a tour of
the U.S. Capitol, the White House, or another D.C. attraction, please
