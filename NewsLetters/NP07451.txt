Even as Washington is stuck in gridlock, my job is to get things done
for Ohio. Over the past couple of weeks, three bills that I authored
passed both houses of Congress and have been signed into law by the
President-core provisions of the CAREER Act to help on worker
retraining, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control
Act of 2013, and the World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2014.
There's a skills gap in our country that is hurting our economy and
preventing unemployed Americans from filling available jobs.
Legislation I authored is going to help close that gap. We need it, now
more than ever. The policies coming out of Washington aren't getting
the job done for those Americans who are unemployed or underemployed or
the factories and other businesses that need skilled workers.
Even as
many of our friends and hundreds of thousands of neighbors around our
state are still struggling to find work, there are 140,000 unfilled
jobs in Ohio. This disconnect between workers looking for jobs and
businesses that are looking for workers is largely driven by a lack of
skills and credentials. The simple truth is a lot of the jobs that are
available require training or the qualifications the unemployed don't
have.
Washington has a role to play to close the skills gap, but the
federal workforce development system put in place for that very purpose
hasn't been getting the job done. According to the Government
Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government has spent as much
as 18 billion of our taxpayer dollars annually to operate 47 different
workforce development programs spread over nine different departments
and agencies.
Forty-five of them overlap with at least one other
program, and only five have conducted an impact study of their efforts
since 2004, leading GAO to conclude that "little is known about the
effectiveness of most programs."
I know we can do better, and that's why I joined with my colleague
Senator Michael Bennet three years ago to work on bipartisan
legislation called the CAREER Act to bring some important reforms to
federal retraining programs. Many of the provisions came from Ohio
community colleges and businesses. I'm pleased to report that I was
able to include key components of this legislation in the Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act that was recently signed into law. These
steps will save taxpayer dollars, help get our economy back on track,
and most importantly, make a difference in the lives of millions of
unemployed workers who are ready for a new start.
Another issue where I've worked to get things done for Ohio is
protecting Lake Erie and Ohio's fresh water bodies. Tourism supports
almost 10 percent of Ohio jobs and generates $750 million in state and
local taxes. Fishing alone supports 100,000 Ohio jobs. Anglers come
from all over the country to enjoy Lake Erie's walleye sports fishery,
considered by many to be the best in the world.
But as many in the Great Lakes region know, algal blooms pose an
increasingly significant threat to public health, the
environment, and the economy of our region. Algal
blooms can cause hypoxia-reduced oxygen in the water-and toxins
produced by blooms can cause illness or death in humans. This has
caused drinking water problems in cities from Columbus to Toledo to
Celina on Grand Lake St. Marys. Algae blooms can also devastate
wildlife, particularly food sources such as fish and shellfish.
To help address this problem, I joined with Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida
to author the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act
of 2013, which reauthorizes the federal government's research and
response framework for algal blooms with a new focus on freshwater
bodies, in particular the Great Lakes. Ohioans-including scientists and
Lake Erie advocates-made important contributions to the legislation. I
am proud that this bipartisan bill passed both chambers of Congress and
will provide resources for critical monitoring, research, and
mitigation efforts for freshwater bodies in Ohio and across the country.
External threats to public health and the economy are one area in which
we can unite people from both sides of the political divide. Our
nation's enduring spirit in the face of great adversity and the
never-ending fight for freedom is another.
The 70th anniversary of D-Day provided all of us with a chance to
remember the great sacrifices made by thousands of brave Americans on
June 6, 1944, as well as the countless more men and women in uniform
who continue to fight for the freedoms we all enjoy. The invasion of
Normandy signaled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany, but it
came with a cost; thousands of men gave their lives that day to free a
continent from the grip of tyranny and oppression. I had the honor to
talk with World War II veterans about D-Day at a recent veterans' town
hall meeting in Southern Ohio and at a veterans' home in Northwest Ohio.
Working with Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, I
authored legislation to eternally commemorate the famous words
President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the nation on D-Day. His
words spoke not only to the struggle then unfolding on the shores of
France, but also to the ideals that make our country exceptional- "They
fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They
fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and tolerance and
goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle,
for their return to the haven of home."
Commemorating President Roosevelt's enduring message at the National
World War II Memorial in Washington D.C. will ensure that those who
defend our freedom abroad know that they take the solemn thoughts and
prayers of every American with them into battle.
Whether it is connecting Ohioans with available jobs, tackling the
contamination of our freshwater lakes, or remembering the eternal
sacrifice of those who gave their lives to the cause of freedom, the
American people should expect their elected representatives to work
together to get things done.
The successful passage of these pieces of
legislation show that it is still possible, and we've got a lot more
work to do.
Recent Visits Around Ohio
Jane and I visited with Park Rangers, the new superintendent, and
others at the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.
Great to see students and Brutus the Buckeye at a recent visit to The
Ohio State University.
I had the opportunity to see the innovative work being done at
Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.
Career & Technical Education prepares students for good jobs. I held a
roundtable at Live Oaks in Clermont County this month to discuss ways
to improve it.

Even
as
Washington
is
stuck
in
gridlock,
my
job
is
to
get
things
done
for
Ohio.
Over
the
past
couple
of
weeks,
three
bills
that
I
authored
passed
both
houses
of
Congress
and
have
been
signed
into
law
by
the
President&#8212;core
provisions
of
the
CAREER
Act
to
help
on
worker
retraining,
the
Harmful
Algal
Bloom
and
Hypoxia
Research
and
Control
Act
of
2013,
and
the
World
War
II
Memorial
Prayer
Act
of
2014.
There&#8217;s
a
skills
gap
in
our
country
that
is
hurting
our
economy
and
preventing
unemployed
Americans
from
filling
available
jobs.
Legislation
I
authored
is
going
to
help
close
that
gap.
We
need
it,
now
more
than
ever.
The
policies
coming
out
of
Washington
aren&#8217;t
getting
the
job
done
for
those
Americans
who
are
unemployed
or
underemployed
or
the
factories
and
other
businesses
that
need
skilled
workers.
Even
as
many
of our
friends
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
neighbors
around
our
state
are
still
struggling
to
find
work,
there
are
140,000
unfilled
jobs
in
Ohio.
This
disconnect
between
workers
looking
for
jobs
and
businesses
that
are
looking
for
workers
is
largely
driven
by
a
lack
of
skills
and
credentials.
The
simple
truth
is a
lot
of
the
jobs
that
are
available
require
training
or
the
qualifications
the
unemployed
don&#8217;t
have.
Washington
has
a
role
to
play
to
close
the
skills
gap,
but
the
federal
workforce
development
system
put
in
place
for
that
very
purpose
hasn&#8217;t
been
getting
the
job
done.
According
to
the
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO),
the
federal
government
has
spent
as
much
as
18
billion
of
our
taxpayer
dollars
annually
to
operate
47
different
workforce
development
programs
spread
over
nine
different
departments
and
agencies.
Forty-five
of
them
overlap
with
at
least
one
other
program,
and
only
five
have
conducted
an
impact
study
of
their
efforts
since
2004,
leading
GAO
to
conclude
that
&#8220;little
is
known
about
the
effectiveness
of
most
programs.&#8221;
I
know
we
can
do
better,
and
that&#8217;s
why
I
joined
with
my
colleague
Senator
Michael
Bennet
three
years
ago to
work
on
bipartisan
legislation
called
the
CAREER
Act
to
bring
some
important
reforms
to
federal
retraining
programs.
Many
of
the
provisions
came
from
Ohio
community
colleges
and
businesses.
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
report
that
I
was
able
to
include
key
components
of
this
legislation
in
the
Workforce
Innovation
and
Opportunity
Act
that
was recently
signed
into
law.
These
steps
will
save
taxpayer
dollars,
help
get
our
economy
back
on
track,
and
most
importantly,
make
a
difference
in
the
lives
of
millions
of
unemployed
workers
who
are
ready
for
a
new
start.
Another
issue
where
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
get
things
done
for
Ohio
is
protecting
Lake
Erie
and
Ohio&#8217;s
fresh
water
bodies.
Tourism
supports
almost
10
percent
of
Ohio
jobs
and
generates
$750
million
in
state
and
local
taxes.
Fishing
alone
supports
100,000
Ohio
jobs.
Anglers
come
from
all
over
the
country
to
enjoy
Lake
Erie&#8217;s
walleye
sports
fishery,
considered
by
many
to
be
the
best
in
the
world.
But
as
many
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
know,
algal
blooms
pose
an
increasingly
significant
threat
to
public
health,
the
environment,
and
the
economy
of
our
region.
Algal
blooms
can
cause
hypoxia&#8212;reduced
oxygen
in
the
water&#8212;and
toxins
produced
by
blooms
can
cause
illness
or
death
in
humans.
This
has
caused
drinking
water
problems
in
cities
from
Columbus
to
Toledo
to
Celina
on
Grand
Lake
St.
Marys.
Algae
blooms
can
also
devastate
wildlife,
particularly
food
sources
such
as
fish
and
shellfish.
To
help
address
this
problem,
I
joined
with
Sen.
Bill
Nelson
of
Florida
to
author
the
Harmful
Algal
Bloom
and
Hypoxia
Research
and
Control
Act
of
2013,
which
reauthorizes
the
federal
government&#8217;s
research
and
response
framework
for
algal
blooms
with
a
new
focus
on
freshwater
bodies,
in
particular
the
Great
Lakes.
Ohioans&#8212;including
scientists
and
Lake
Erie
advocates&#8212;made
important
contributions
to
the
legislation.
I
am
proud
that
this
bipartisan
bill
passed
both
chambers
of
Congress
and
will provide
resources
for
critical
monitoring,
research,
and
mitigation
efforts
for
freshwater
bodies
in
Ohio
and
across
the
country.
External
threats
to
public
health
and
the
economy
are
one
area
in
which
we
can
unite
people
from
both
sides
of
the
political
divide.
Our
nation&#8217;s
enduring
spirit
in
the
face
of
great
adversity
and
the
never-ending
fight
for
freedom
is
another.
The
70th
anniversary
of
D-Day
provided
all
of
us
with
a
chance
to
remember
the
great
sacrifices
made
by
thousands
of
brave
Americans
on
June
6,
1944,
as
well
as
the
countless
more
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
continue
to
fight
for
the
freedoms
we
all
enjoy.
The
invasion
of
Normandy
signaled
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
Nazi
Germany,
but
it
came
with
a
cost;
thousands
of
men
gave

that

to
free
a

to
talk
with
World
War

veterans
about
D-Day
at
a
recent
veterans&#8217;
town
hall
meeting
in
Southern
Ohio
and
at
a

home
in

Ohio.
Working
with
Sen.
Mary

of
Louisiana,
I
authored
legislation
to
eternally
commemorate
the
famous
words
President
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
prayed
with
the
nation
on
D-Day.
His
words
spoke
not
only
to
the
struggle
then
unfolding
on
the
shores
of
France,
but
also
to
the
ideals
that
make
our
country
exceptional&#8212;
"They
fight
not
for
the
lust
of
conquest.
They
fight
to
end
conquest.
They
fight
to
liberate.
They
fight
to
let
justice
arise,
and
tolerance
and
goodwill
among
all
Thy
people.
They
yearn
but
for
the
end
of
battle,
for
their
return
to
the
haven
of
home."
Commemorating
President
Roosevelt&#8217;s
enduring
message
at
the
National
World
War
II
Memorial
in
Washington
D.C.
will
ensure
that
those
who
defend
our
freedom
abroad
know
that
they
take
the
solemn
thoughts
and
prayers
of
every
American
with
them
into
battle.
Whether
it
is
connecting
Ohioans
with
available
jobs,
tackling
the
contamination
of
our
freshwater
lakes,
or
remembering
the
eternal
sacrifice
of
those
who
gave
their
lives
to
the
cause
of
freedom,
the
American
people
should
expect
their
elected
representatives
to
work
together
to
get
things
done.
The
successful
passage
of
these
pieces
of
legislation
show
that
it
is
still
possible,
and
we&#8217;ve

a
