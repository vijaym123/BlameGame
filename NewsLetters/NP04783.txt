Press Release: Forbes Receives Guardian of Seniors' Rights Award
Washington, D.C. - Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) was awarded the Guardian of Seniors Rights Award by The 60 Plus Association for his strong support of seniors throughout the 113th Congress.
Keeping our promises as a nation is not an option, its an obligation, said Congressman Forbes. Seniors deserve to have confidence that the United States government will keep its word to them. I will continue to do all that I can to protect their peace-of-mind by working to preserve Social Security and Medicare, by ensuring they have continued access to the doctor theyve seen for years, and by helping make sure they are not worried about leaving their children a tax bill instead of an inheritance. Its an honor to receive this award.
The 60 Plus Association is a nonpartisan organization that has taken on important issues such as repealing the death tax, preserving Social Security and Medicare, working to lower energy costs, and ensuring access to quality, affordable healthcare. To find more information on 60 plus, please visit
