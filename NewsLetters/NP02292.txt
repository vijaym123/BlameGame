Speaking at South Florida's Associated General Contractors Chapter
[cid:image001.jpg@01D05D9E.0DD54140]
On Tuesday evening, I spoke to members of South Florida's Associated General Contractors Chapter about regulatory reform and the need for greater investments in transportation and infrastructure. These are the leaders responsible for building Miami. They employ inspirational people who are trying to get ahead.

Statement on President Obama's Executive Order to Sanction Human Rights
Violators in Venezuela
"Yesterday's sanctions are a long overdue first step in holding the Maduro regime accountable for its grotesque disrespect for human rights.
In recent months, the Maduro regime has continued to use lethal force to control opposition protests, including a 14 year old student who was shot and killed by police while walking to school in San Cristobal.
Additionally, the regime has moved to expel Julio Borges, a moderate opposition leader, from the National Assembly. Leopoldo Lpez, another opposition leader, has been in jail for a year and is now on trial for treason.
On February 19, agents of Venezuela's state security service, without a warrant, stormed the office of the mayor of Caracas and arrested him for conspiracy to commit violent acts against the regime.
I continue to stand in solidarity with the peaceful, democratic opposition in Venezuela that opposes thuggish rule and proudly stands for liberty.
While the Administration's new sanctions are a step forward in our larger effort to hold all repressive regimes accountable, there is still much more to be done to ensure that all those responsible for perpetrating human rights violations in Venezuela are held accountable.
I applaud the Venezuelan-American community in the United States that has been instrumental in advocating on behalf of the people of Venezuela and continue to stand in unity for the cause of justice and freedom."
