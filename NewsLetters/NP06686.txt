Blaine's Bulletin
Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have a right and a desire to know.
John Adams
When I travel the 3 rd
Congressional District each week, I am always eager to hear your concerns about things going on around our nation. We are at a critical point in our nations history and because there is so much happening across not only the United States but also around the world, its important for you to stay informed. Whether you call my offices in Missouri or Washington or send me an email, I value your input because as your voice in Congress, I have a responsibility to take the concerns of Main Street and ensure they are heard in your Capitol.
During my time in Congress, I have been fortunate to visit with many of you through the different means of communication that my offices provide. For the third time this year, my staff will host Constituent Service Days. These allow you to share your concerns face-to-face with members of my staff. These Constituent Service Days will be held in all 13 counties beginning Monday, Sept. 15 and will run through Thursday, Sept. 18. For more than five years my office has been able to assist hundreds of folks as a result of Constituent Service Days and I encourage you to attend if you have any questions or concerns. For dates, times, and locations, please go to my website
www.luetkemeyer.house.gov
to get all the information. Or call the Jefferson City office at 573-635-7232 to get the details.
Another example of communication Ive implemented since Ive been in Congress are Tele-Town Hall meetings. These are telephone conference calls that I hold several times a year. They allow thousands of people to call and not just listen to me talk about whats happening in Washington and the 3 rd
Congressional District but this also provides an opportunity for you to ask me a question directly. To sign up for these, please go to my website at
www.luetkemeyer.house.gov .
Lastly, since Ive been in Congress, social media has become an integral part of my commitment to communicating with you. To that end, I wanted to make sure you are aware of my involvement in several social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Each of these tools provides you with unique insight into what Im working on in Congress. For up-to-the minute news on my work as a member of the Financial Services Committee and Vice Chairman of the Small Business Committee, find me on Twitter. If you want to see whos stopped by my office or who Im meeting at home, please find me on Instagram. Then theres Facebook, which provides you with the opportunity to read news from a variety of daily media sources. Lastly, if you want to watch videos from Committee hearings or speeches Ive given on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, youll find them on my YouTube page.
As you can see, there are several avenues that are available to stay connected. However, if you want to send a handwritten letter or pick up the phone and give my staff a call, my staff is ready and willing to either answer your question or help with any concern or issue you may have. As always, thank you for the honor of serving you.
