David --
For nearly 80 years, hardworking Americans have relied on the Social Security they&rsquo;ve earned to retire with dignity.
But last week -- with NO Democratic support -- Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans voted to undermine Social Security as their first act of business.
Now, a staggering
eleven million
disabled workers could see their benefits slashed. Cheri&rsquo;s standing strong against their extremist plan, but we need you with us.
