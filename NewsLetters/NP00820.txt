Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Yesterday the National Football League punished one
of its most recognizable players for allegedly having tampered with
game balls.
I find it stunning that the NFL is more
concerned about how much air is in a ball than with a racist franchise name
that denigrates Native Americans across our country. The Redskins name
is a racist name. So I wish the Commissioner would act as swiftly and
decisively in changing the name of the Washington, D.C. team, as he
did enforcing how much air is in the football.
