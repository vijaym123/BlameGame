 ISIS forces around the town of Sinjar. This advance broke ISISs siege of Mount Sinjar, where thousands of civilians had fled after ISIS launched
a calculated campaign of mass murder. Despite this progress, ISISs recent publication
of a manual approving the beating and trading of Christian and Jewish sex slaves, alongside harrowing reports
of the widespread murder and forced conversion of Christians
including the killing of children
should remind us of the terrible fate that will befall millions if these depraved zealots are not defeated.
Not many Americans would want to live amid this dangerous war. Yet in Iraq, I met U.S. servicemen and women who are risking their lives to assist the battle against ISIS. I am in awe of their selfless courage. These Americans are spending Christmas there
in a warzone far from friends and family
so that we can celebrate Christmas in safety here.
So Id like to offer my gratitude and appreciation to military veterans as well as active duty, reserve, and national guard servicemembers, especially those now on deployment, and wish my friends and constituents a Merry Christmas.
Sincerely,

Dear Friends,
I recently returned from a trip to the Middle East that included visits to the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Erbil. There was some good news out of Iraq recently, as Kurdish
fighters
helped by U.S. airstrikes
pushed back
