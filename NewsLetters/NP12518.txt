United States House of Representatives Passes Legislation Introduced by
Rep. Mark Takano
Last week, the House of Representatives passed the GI Bill Tuition
Fairness Act (H.R. 357), a bipartisan piece of legislation that would
improve veterans benefits with regards to education, vocational
rehabilitation, and job training.
The GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act includes the VetSuccess Enhancement
Act (H.R. 844) and the Work Study for Student Veterans Act (H.R. 1453),
both of which were originally introduced by Rep. Takano.
Upon its passage, Takano said, "Too often our veterans have difficulty
reintegrating back into civilian life upon their return and Congress
should be doing all that it can to make things easier for our heroes.
This piece of legislation does just that by extending the VA's work
study program to 2018, increasing the timeframe for veterans to use
their vocational rehabilitation benefits from 12 to 17 years, and by
giving all veterans in-state tuition rates when they attend a school
eligible for GI Bill education benefits. I'm proud that both sides of
the aisle came together for this fix and I look forward to more
bipartisan cooperation as we work to improve our veterans' lives."
The VetSuccess Enhancement Act increases veterans' access to critical
vocation and educational services by extending the eligibility period
from 12 to 17 years. The VetSuccess program provides disabled veterans
with employment, vocational, and educational services. These services
include vocational counseling, job-seeking skills and resume
development, job training and apprenticeships, and financial assistance
with post-secondary training at college, vocational, technical, or
business school.
The Work Study for Student Veterans Act extends the Department of
Veterans Affairs' Student Work-Study Allowance Program, which expired
last summer, until 2018. Through this program, qualifying veteran
students in college degree programs or vocational or professional
programs are paid to work on campus, at VA facilities, or at other
veteran-centered organizations to assist transitioning veterans and
help them navigate the complex VA system.
Takano was also the Democratic lead on the portion of the bill that
would require that if a servicemember plans to use their education
benefits following discharge they would be required to take the
education track as part of the mandatory portion of TAP. This training
would include information about the education benefits available to
servicemembers, testing for academic readiness, information about
financing the education or training, and training on matching a school
to the servicemembers' interests.

Rep. Takano Delivers 2014 State of the District Speech
In light of President Obama's State of the Union speech last week, Rep.
Takano delivered his own for California's 41st Congressional District.
"Our region was hit particularly hard by the Great Recession, as we
experienced an unemployment rate higher than the national average and
more home foreclosures than anywhere else in the nation.
Despite those challenges, I'm proud to say that the state of the Inland
Empire is improving.
Albeit not fast enough, our unemployment rate is
falling and the housing market is recuperating.
Throughout 2013, my staff and I committed ourselves to providing a high
level of constituent services and representation. My office closed
nearly 250 cases and returned more than $1.1 million in benefits to
residents."

Rep. Takano Urges Extension of Unemployment Benefits
Since late last year, the expiration of unemployment benefits has cost
states more than $2.2 billion in economic activity. Rep. Takano has
long advocated for their extension and expressed his disappointment
when Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would provide relief.
"This afternoon, Republicans in the Senate blocked legislation that
would have extended unemployment benefits. This despite the fact that
Senate Democrats had compromised by making sure the extension was fully
paid for and limited to only 3 months," Takano said.
"Failing to extend these benefits to the long-term unemployed is
harming our economy. We must renew UI."

congratulations and have the utmost confidence in their ability to make
our nation proud."
