In the last year and a half, the House has passed 40 bills, many with bipartisan support, to spur economic growth and promote job creation for hardworking Americans.
Just last week, the House passed two bills to help Americans find work:
H.R. 803 : This bill will reform and streamline federal workforce development programs to promote training for in-demand jobs, reduce bureaucracy, and create a worker-friendly, simple system. The Senate, thanks to Sen. Tim Scotts hard work, also passed this legislation and it now awaits the Presidents signature.
H.R. 4718 : This bill permanently extends a provision in the tax code, which allows businesses to immediately deduct 50% of capital investments for things like tractors and computers. This will give certainty to businesses and encourage them to expand. According to the Tax Foundation, this provision would help add 212,000 new jobs.

Two months after the House of Representatives chartered a new committee to investigate the 2012 Benghazi attacks, the panel will begin getting down to work in July, Chairman Trey Gowdy said, but it will not be in a hurry to make headlines.
