Congressman Stockman Wishes You a Happy
Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is the day to not just be thankful,
but thankful to God. With what has He blessed you?
During my service to you in Congress, I continually give thanks to God for
our Founding Fathers who gave us our Constitution; the greatest
constitution and system of government in the world. I give thanks for our
veterans, without whom our nation and freedom may not have survived.
I give thanks to each and every American; for we are all
blessed by God, and it is by our works by which Americans are known
and respected worldwide as truly exceptional.
I wish
you a wonderful day of Thanksgiving.
