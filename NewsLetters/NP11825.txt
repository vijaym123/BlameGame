Dear Friend,
Recently, I visited
the students and teachers at Mill Creek Elementary in Salt Lake City.
It was great to talk with this impressive group and my office also
donated several boxes of childrens books to the school for their library.
I was able to share these books as part of the Library of Congress
Surplus Book Program which allows Members of Congress to donate extra
books to schools and non-profits in their community. During the past
year, my office has organized six book donations like the one at Mill
Creek Elementary.
This week, we kick off National Reading
Month and research overwhelmingly shows that learning to read at an early
age can help set the stage for a successful future.
One study
found that 88 percent of students who failed to graduate
high school, tested below proficient in reading in the third grade. I
feel strongly that we should all look for creative solutions, like
sharing surplus books, to provide support and resources to schools and
community organizations that promote the importance of
reading.

at Mill Creek Elementary School in Salt Lake City.
As the father of two school-age
sons, I agree that educating our children is the most important
investment we can make in our future. As your representative in Congress, I
will continue to work with my colleagues on policies that ensure that
every child has access to a quality education. For tips provided by

I am honored to
serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours. As your
representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and
issues affecting you and our community. Please
let
me know
areas you find especially interesting or where I can
provide you with additional information. I value your ideas and look
forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
