David -- We have a MAJOR problem. And only a few hours left to find a solution. Please read this A.S.A.P.
First, the good news: The Republicans are in an all-out panic.
They&rsquo;re furious that we can beat them in ruby-red states like Arkansas, West Virginia, and Nebraska.
So now, they&rsquo;re going all out to stop us.
This morning, it became official: Boehner&rsquo;s allies will spend $25 MILLION this week against Democrats -- the most of the entire election. David
-- It would be painful to give up now just because we couldn&rsquo;t afford to compete.
So if you&rsquo;re reading this email right now, we need your help.
Please step up again before the FINAL ad buy deadline tonight.

And David -- the latest Fox News poll shows the race for Congress is still a dead heat. Please, we need your help more than ever!
Keep it up!
