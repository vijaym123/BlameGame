News from Representative Lou Barletta
Monday, February 3, 2014
I wanted to take a moment to reach out to make sure I am doing all I
can to best serve you as your congressional representative.
During teletown halls and individual meetings, I have heard from many
constituents about the issues affecting Pennsylvania's 11th District
and our nation as a whole. My main priority since coming to Congress in
2011 has been to work on your behalf in the U.S. House of
Representatives to the best of my abilities. I believe some of the best
solutions to America's problems come from outside Washington, D.C., and
I am here to be your voice.
Additionally, I believe it is important to increase transparency in the
federal government. Therefore, I would like to keep you updated on what
I am doing to serve you and invite you to sign up for my email
newsletter, The Barletta Bulletin, by visiting my website at
http://barletta.house.gov
. This email newsletter is just one way to keep my
constituents up to date on my actions in both Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C., and includes legislative updates as well.
Rest assured, I remain committed to working for you in Washington.
Should you have comments or questions on this or any other issue,
please contact me at my Washington, D.C., Hazleton, Harrisburg,
Carlisle, or Sunbury office. My door is always open and I look forward
to hearing from you.
