Dear Fellow Coloradan,
Throughout our nation's long history, American manufacturing has buoyed our economic success and helped us win the global economic race. From the post-war boom through today, Made-in-America jobs and products have laid the foundation for much of Colorado&rsquo;s prosperity and success.
I've seen this firsthand at Vestas plants in places like Pueblo, Brighton and Windsor and at businesses across our great state. However, these strides are at risk unless Congress stands up against companies that ship good-paying jobs overseas.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m championing the Bring Jobs Home Act, a common-sense bill to fix our tax code and bring middle-class jobs back to America.
Right now, corporations that outsource jobs overseas can claim their moving expenses as tax-deductible costs of doing business. This backwards policy simply doesn&rsquo;t make sense &mdash; and Coloradans agree.
That's why I&rsquo;m concerned that a minority of lawmakers in the U.S. Senate obstructed this common-sense reform. You deserve better, and I&rsquo;ll keep fighting to ensure our laws reward companies for bringing jobs back home.
The Bring Jobs Home Act looks out for the best interests of Coloradans &mdash; not corporations who use tax breaks to ship jobs overseas. Please join me and call on Congress to act and restore fairness to our tax code.
With Coloradans by my side, I&rsquo;m fighting to prioritize middle-class families. Join me in supporting made-in-America jobs and putting more Coloradans back to work.
Warm regards,
Offices
