I enjoyed attending the Sunbelt Ag Expo in Moultrie last week.
It was
great to speak with Eighth District farmers about the agriculture
industry in our district and across the state.
I appreciated having
Congressman Jack Kingston and Congressman Ted Yoho, whose district in
Florida borders our district, attend the event with me.
Don't forget to keep sending me your favorite farm and crop photos so I
can share them on my facebook
page. Email your pictures to
repscottphotos@mail.house.gov
,
and be sure to LIKE
my facebook page to see if your photo was
posted. Thanks, Diana, for sending me this photo of a beautiful
sunflower field in Elko in South Houston County!
REMINDER:
The Medicare Open Enrollment Period began last Wednesday and runs until
December 7th.
My office is here to help!
