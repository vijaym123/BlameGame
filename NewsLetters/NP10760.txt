Equal Pay for
Equal Work Women on average still earn only 77
cents for every dollar earned by men. I want to hear from you on what
we are doing to fix the gender pay gap. What are effective steps to take in closing the wage
gap for women? Protection against retaliation for inquiring about, discussing, or
disclosing wages. Allow women who were discriminated against to sue their
employer. Make wage information
available and hold employers accountable. Are there any additional steps
you would like to see Congress take? *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my

Congressman Cedric
Richmond
2nd Congressional District of
Louisiana
