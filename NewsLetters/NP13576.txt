Washington Update...
Passage of the 52nd National Defense Authorization Act
I am pleased to report that last week the Senate and the House reached an agreement that resulted in the passing of the 52nd National Defense Authorization Act with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.
The passage of the 52nd National Defense Authorization Act is a tremendous achievement for the 113th Congress. Ive been honored to lead our Committee and all members of the House through this process. It is always heartening to see that, even during these partisan times, Members were able to put politics aside in support of our brave men and women in uniform. The NDAA ensures that Congress accomplishes its Constitutional prerogative, to provide for the common defense. This legislation continues our effort to rebuild a military that has been tested by a decade at war.
It upholds the unwavering tradition of Congressional oversight, while providing support to the warfighter and value to the taxpayer.
Members are departing the nations capital to be with their loved ones for the holidays. Let me take this opportunity to remind them that, for thousands of troops around the world, homecoming may still be months away. I hope they will see the passage of this legislation as a sign of steadfast support for them and their cause from a grateful nation.
I look forward to visiting with folks back home over the holidays. Wishing everyone a joyous season!
Best ,
