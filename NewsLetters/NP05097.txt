Program
for FY2014 has an abundance of low interest loan money
available (current interest rate is 4.0 percent). It is expected that
this funding will continue in FY2015. Under the CF Program loans/grants

areas with a population of 20,000 or less. The program helps
communities provide vital services and amenities for their residents and
visitors. This includes fire and rescue support services (such as fire
halls, fire trucks, ambulances, and equipment), town halls, town barns,
libraries, health care (hospitals, clinics, medical office buildings),
museums, and schools.
