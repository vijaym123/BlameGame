REEDS REMARKS
Last week,
Heller joined Reed
on
a bill to boost the economy and provide
relief for the more than 1.3 million
job-seeking Americans who have lost
emergency unemployment insurance coverage
since December 28, 2013.
The bill is cosponsored by Senators
Susan Collins (R-ME), Rob Portman (R-OH),
Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Mark Kirk
(R-IL), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Cory
Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and
Dick Durbin (D-IL).
Excerpts from remarks as
prepared:
I thank my fiend from Rhode
Island for his continued work to help the
American people by temporarily extending
unemployment insurance benefits. This is
something weve been working on
together since this past December and
Im pleased that we have finally
reached a bipartisan agreement that can
pass this chamber.
Fortunately, I believe we have
reached a compromise that will garner
enough support in the Senate to help 1.3
million unemployed Americans get back on
their feet as they look for work in the
toughest job market in decades. The bill
before us this week is a responsible, fully
paid-for, temporary extension of
unemployment insurance benefits that
expired in December. It addresses concerns
that any further extensions ought to be
paid for.
Madam President, as our economy
recovers and people find new jobs, the
demand for these social safety net programs
should naturally diminish, but states like
Nevada, Rhode Island, and many others still
have a long economic recovery ahead of
them.
I look forward to moving to this
bill very soon andam hopeful that
Congress can finally resolve this matter as
soon as possible to help restore some
stability for the millions of unemployed
Americans looking to get back to
work.
