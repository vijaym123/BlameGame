News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
On Thursday, December 12th, the House passed a bipartisan budget deal
worked out by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate
counterpart, Senator Patty Murray. The deal passed overwhelmingly, with
huge support from both sides.
I voted against it. It wasn't an easy decision.
In short, the deal would replace the sequestration cuts for the
military - something I have been adamantly and vocally supportive of.
The cuts to the Pentagon have been so deep that they've gone far beyond
cancelling wasteful procurement and research projects and have been
cutting training hours for our troops. At this moment, and this is not
a state secret, only 15% of our Army is combat ready. A full 85% are
not trained well enough to remain safe and effective in the field. As a
father of three soldiers, that is a serious, serious concern to me. I've
been fighting for a solution on this issue for months and I don't take
opposing such a solution lightly.
In the end, it came down to two things. First, one of the major "cost
offset" provisions in the bill would limit the annual COLA for military
retirees - including, notably, those who were forced to retire due to
service-connected injuries - to inflation minus one percent. The whole
point of a cost-of-living-adjustment is to keep up with inflation and
this proposal would explicitly do the opposite.
Second, there is a general tendency in Washington to "pay for" one year
of spending increases with promised future cuts spread over a future
decade. Far too often, those promised cuts are never realized while the
increased spending is quickly forgotten.
It's no secret that the Republicans and Democrats are extremely far
apart on spending and tax policy. The fact that Rep. Ryan and Sen.
Murray could find that common ground says a lot about their leadership.
It wasn't an easy task and they deserve a lot of credit. In the end
though, the final product is once again proof to me that the only way
Washington will ever find the discipline to seriously address our
spending imbalance is with a Balanced Budget Amendment to the
Constitution.
State and local governments find a way to balance the books each year -
not because it's easy, not because they are universally more
responsible than their federal colleagues, it's because they don't have
a choice. The vast majority of states have some sort of legal
requirement to balance their budgets each year. And local governments,
by and large, simply don't have the ability to borrow huge sums of
money to pay for annual operating budgets. The federal government has
no such legal requirement and can borrow far too easily from
individuals and foreign nations.
I will continue pushing for a Balanced Budget Amendment because there
simply is no other viable alternative to getting federal lawmakers to
deal with the real and systemic imbalance in our spending and tax
policy. I will also continue to ensure that this nation's most sacred
obligations are met and its responsibilities fulfilled. That means
preserving a strong national defense and not balancing the budget on
backs of those who risk themselves to keep the rest of us safe.
That's where I stand. As always, I am interested to hear from you about
your views on this and all of the issues facing the federal government.
And if there is anything my office can do to be of service, please don't
hesitate to call. One final note as we head into the holiday season. I
wanted to make sure that everybody is aware that we still have a POW in
Afghanistan who likely won't be home in time to spend Christmas with
his family. The young man's name is Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and he was
captured four years ago. While Sgt. Bergdahl remains part of every
negotiation over each Status of Forces Agreement, his safe return has
not yet been secured. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
On
Thursday,
December
12th,
the
House
passed
a
bipartisan
budget
deal
worked
out
by
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan
and
his
Senate
counterpart,
Senator
Patty
Murray.
The
deal
passed
overwhelmingly,
with
huge
support
from
both
sides.
I
voted
against
it.
It
wasn&#8217;t
an
easy
decision.
In
short,
the
deal
would
replace
the
sequestration
cuts
for
the
military
&#8211;
something
I
have
been
adamantly
and
vocally
supportive
of.
The
cuts
to
the
Pentagon
have
been
so
deep
that
they&#8217;ve
gone
far
beyond
cancelling
wasteful
procurement
and
research
projects
and
have
been
cutting
training
hours
for
our
troops.
At
this
moment,
and
this
is
not
a
state
secret,
only
15%
of
our
Army
is
combat
ready.
A
full
85%
are
not
trained
well
enough
to
remain
safe
and
effective
in
the
field.
As
a
father
of
three
soldiers,
that
is
a
serious,
serious
concern
to
me.
I&#8217;ve
been
fighting
for
a
solution
on
this
issue
for
months
and
I
don&#8217;t
take
opposing
such
a
solution
lightly.
In
the
end,
it
came
down
to
two
things.
First,
one
of
the
major
&#8220;cost
offset&#8221;
provisions
in
the
bill
would
limit
the
annual
COLA
for
military
retirees
&#8211;
including,
notably,
those
who
were
forced
to
retire
due
to
service-connected
injuries
&#8211;
to
inflation
minus
one
percent.
The
whole
point
of
a
cost-of-living-adjustment
is
to
keep
up
with
inflation
and
this
proposal
would
explicitly
do
the
opposite.
Second,
there
is
a
general
tendency
in
Washington
to
&#8220;pay
for&#8221;
one
year
of
spending
increases
with
promised
future
cuts
spread
over
a
future
decade.
Far
too
often,
those
promised
cuts
are
never
realized
while
the
increased
spending
is
quickly
forgotten.
It&#8217;s
no
secret
that
the
Republicans
and
Democrats
are
extremely
far
apart
on
spending
and
tax
policy.
The
fact
that
Rep.
Ryan
and
Sen.
Murray
could
find
that
common
ground
says
a
lot
about
their
leadership.
It
wasn&#8217;t
an
easy
task
and
they
deserve
a
lot
of
credit.
In
the
end
though,
the
final
product
is
once
again
proof
to
me
that
the
only
way
Washington
will
ever
find
the
discipline
to
seriously
address
our
spending
imbalance
is
with
a
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
to
the
Constitution.
State
and
local
governments
find
a
way
to
balance
the
books
each
year
&#8211;
not
because
it&#8217;s
easy,
not
because
they
are
universally
more
responsible
than
their
federal
colleagues,
it&#8217;s
because
they
don&#8217;t
have
a
choice.
The
vast
majority
of
states
have
some
sort
of
legal
requirement
to
balance
their
budgets
each
year.
And
local
governments,
by
and
large,
simply
don&#8217;t
have
the
ability
to
borrow
huge
sums
of
money
to
pay
for
annual
operating
budgets.
The
federal
government
has
no
such
legal
requirement
and
can
borrow
far
too
easily
from
individuals
and
foreign
nations.
I
will
continue
pushing
for
a
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
because
there
simply
is
no
other
viable
alternative
to
getting
federal
lawmakers
to
deal
with
the
real
and
systemic
imbalance
in
our
spending
and
tax
policy.
I
will
also
continue
to
ensure
that
this
nation&#8217;s
most
sacred
obligations
are
met
and
its
responsibilities
fulfilled.
That
means
preserving
a
strong
national
defense
and
not
balancing
the
budget
on
backs
of
those
who
risk
themselves
to
keep
the
rest
of
us
safe.
That&#8217;s
where
I
stand.
As
always,
I
am
interested
to
hear
from
you
about
your
views
on
this
and
all
of
the
issues
facing
the
federal
government.
And
if
there
is
anything
my
office
can
do
to
be
of
service,
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
call.
One
final
note
as
we
head
into
the
holiday
season.
I
wanted
to
make
sure
that
everybody
is
aware
that
we
still
have
a
POW
in
Afghanistan
who
likely
won't
be
home
in
time
to
spend
Christmas
with
his
family.
The
young
man's
name
is
Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl
and
he
was
captured
four
years
ago.
While
Sgt.
Bergdahl
remains
part
of
every
negotiation
over
each
Status
of
Forces
Agreement,
his
safe
return
has
not
yet
been
secured.
Please
keep
him
in
your
thoughts
and
prayers.
Thanks
again.
