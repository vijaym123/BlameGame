REMINDER:
Westmoreland Hosts Veterans Workshop
On Tuesday,
April 15, 2014, I will host a Veterans Workshop at the Asa M. Powell
Expo Center in Newnan from 9:00am
12:00pm. The Asa M. Powell Expo
center is located at 197 Temple Avenue in Newnan, Georgia. There will be
representatives from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Georgia Department of Veterans Service to discuss the opportunities
and services they provide, as well as an opportunity to speak about your
case with them and with my
staff.
I want to thank the Veterans of Georgias Third District for their
service to our nation. Id also like to thank the speakers and
representatives from the local Veterans Affairs offices for giving their time
to help and inform our soldiers, as well as my staff for organizing
the event. This is a chance for people to learn more about how we can
help with their cases and make sure they are getting the right
information and benefits from their
service.
