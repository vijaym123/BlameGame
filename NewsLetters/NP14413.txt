Forward to a Friend
Dear Friend,
Today we pause to honor the service of generations of veterans and reflect on the sacrifices they and their families have made for our great country.
As a military parent, I strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to serve those who have worn our countrys uniform and their families with the same dedication and honor with which they have served our nation. That is why we must end the backlog that forces veterans to wait years for their benefits; ensure that no one who has served our country in uniform has to fight for a job here at home; provide our troops with the training, support, and care they need and deserve; and support our military families.
I stand ready to assist any Iowa service member, veteran, or military family in any way I can. If you or a family member, friend, or neighbor need any assistance, I urge you to
email
or call me at 1.866.914.IOWA.
Not just this weekend, but every day, let us honor and support those who wear our nation's uniform; care for those who have served; and live up to the sacrifices generations of veterans have made and that our service members continue to make today.
To our men and women in uniform and to our veterans - thank you for your service to our great nation.
Sincerely,
Dave Loebsack
Iowa's Second District
