Keystone Pipeline = Jobs and Energy Independence
Over the
course of this Congress, the House has remained focused on delivering
solutions for the American people and getting our economy moving
again. In fact, the House has passed over 370 bills
many of which will
create jobs and boost the economy
that are still languishing in the
Senate.
At least eight of these bills provided Congressional
approval of construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the
petroleum refineries along the American Gulf Coast.
I
was pleased to be able to vote, once again, to approve the Keystone
Pipeline again this morning. Todays vote in the House represented a
critical step toward increasing our energy independence and getting the
American economy back on track.
This project that has been ignored
by the President and the Senate for six years while 40,000 jobs hang
in the balance.
Further delay is unacceptable for another
reason.
The Canadians are not just waiting around for the Obama
Administration to make a decision.
Other nations, including
China, are now maneuvering to take advantage of this energy
source.
The President told Americans last week, I hear you.
But is
he listening when it comes to the Keystone pipeline, and the tens of
thousands of jobs and enhanced energy security that come with
it?
Keeping the Pressure on the VA to
Reform
I was honored to join many of my fellow veterans this past
week to mark Veterans Day 2014. As citizens, we owe a great debt to
all those who have served in the Armed Forces, and to their families.
Abraham Lincoln defined it quite clearly in his Second Inaugural
Address: To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow,
and his orphan.
This is a sacred obligation that we must
always meet. And when we fall short
as the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) did recently
we must do what it takes to correct
deficiencies quickly.
When the unacceptable delays and denials of
care came to light earlier this year, Congress promptly passed
legislation to give the VA additional tools to correct their flawed system and
hold deficient VA managers accountable.
In
September, the VA leadership announced a Road to Veterans Day initiative
a
series of strategies and actions that will enable the VA
to:
Rebuild trust with Veterans and the American
people;
Improve service delivery;
Set the course for
long-term excellence and reform
Last Tuesday, the VA
released a progress report on the Road to Veterans Day
initiative.
You can access that document
here .
As President Truman said so eloquently, Our debt to the heroic
men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid.
They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget
their sacrifices.
In that spirit, Congress will stay focused
on the VA to ensure that the progress it claims is real and
effective.

Condolezza Rice: The U.S. Has Created a
Vacuum
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that the United States has
created a vacuum being filled with terrorism and other overseas
issues and that Americans might want a more modest foreign policy
but
they also dont like the consequences of a United States that isnt
deeply engaged.

Washington
Times

Farewell to a Champion of family rights - Marge
Roukema
Thats how the Bergen Record headlined this weeks passing of
former Congresswoman Marge Roukema. Marge and I were friends for many
years and I was fortunate to serve with her in the House of
Representatives representing neighboring districts in Northern New Jersey.
From her work on key Committees to her role as Dean of our Delegation,
it was evident to all that she loved New Jersey and cared deeply
about doing what was right for her constituents.
Her public life is
a reminder to all of what can be accomplished working together and
across party lines. Marge was never shy about where she stood on the
issues and she crossed party lines when the cause was right. She will be
deeply missed and long remembered for her dedicated service to our
state over several
decades.
Salute:
Verona High School grads Brett DAlessandro and Kevin Clarke for
co-founding
Backpacks For Life , a non-profit
that aims to get homeless veterans some of the resources they need to
be as strong as they were on the battlefield.
Their non-profit
organization has stuffed hundreds of backpacks with blankets, hats,
gloves, thermal layers, handwarmers or other items to protect veterans
in need from winter weather.
Salute:
Eric Luker and
Woodland Park Legion
Post 238.
Thank you to Commander Luker and his
fellow Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for hosting a Veterans Day dinner to
bring members of the Woodland Park community together with veterans
from all conflicts.
