TRIPLE-MATCH CANCELLATION
The 3X MATCH EXPIRES at midnight. Our campaign is at stake. If you've been planning to chip in, time is running out to TRIPLE your impact.
David, exactly 336 donations for Cheri have been triple-matched today. But, according to our records, your name isn&rsquo;t associated with any of them.
Don&rsquo;t miss this chance:
The election is exactly 15 DAYS away.
A new poll showed our race within a SINGLE DIGIT.
And Karl Rove just launched a MASSIVE campaign to smear Cheri&rsquo;s record.
This is your
FINAL
