ICYMI: Rubio Marks 50
th
Anniversary Of
Reagans A Time For
Choosing
In
an
op-ed for
National Review Online , Marco
marked the 50
th
anniversary of President
Reagans A Time for
Choosing speech. An excerpt of the
op-ed is below:
In the half century since that
speech, some of the policy debates
Reagan discussed have changed while
others have not. But every single one
of the principles he outlined is just
as relevant today as in 1964. I believe
the modern conservative movement can
find its roots in that speech, but I
also believe it can find its blueprint
for the months and years ahead,
starting with the election next
week.
Republican candidates today have an
opportunity
and an obligation
to do what Reagan did in 1964:
explain exactly what makes America
exceptional and exactly what will be
required to keep her that way. First,
this requires defending the principles
of our founding, the same ones
supported in A Time for
Choosing. Second, it requires
policy ideas that apply these
principles to modern challenges.
Americas founding ideals can
be applied in the 21st century just as
easily as Reagan applied them in the
20th century, just not in the same way.
Today, we need modern reforms that
recognize modern realities: that our
country now faces global competition
for jobs, that technology has
transformed the very nature of our
economy, and that our policies and
institutions have failed to adapt
accordingly.

Rubio Marks International Religious
Freedom Day, Highlights Cases Of
Religious Persecution Around The
World
On Monday, Marco issued the following
statement marking International Religious
Freedom Day and condemning examples of
religious persecution around the
world:
Religious freedom is not just
an American ideal, but a human one. On
this International Religious Freedom
Day, I stand in solidarity with
everyone across the globe who is forced
to practice their chosen faithin
secret for fear of persecution,
including in some cases, the threat of
death.
In 2013, the world witnessed
the largest displacement of religious
communities in recent memory, and the
trend in 2014 has only gotten worse.
Today is a day to not only remember
international religious freedom, but a
time to renew Americas
commitment to advocating for religious
freedom abroad, and our moral
responsibility to speak out when it is
threatened anywhere.
Such is the case in China
where Alimujiang Yimiti, a Muslim
convert to Christianity, was sentenced
to 15 years in prison in 2009 and is
still being imprisoned solely
because of his faith. In
Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian woman,
was sentenced to death in 2010 for
blasphemy and has been languishing in a
jail ever since as her husband and five
children live under death threats and
have been forced into hiding. In Iran,
Saeed Abedini, a 32-year-old American
citizen with dual Iranian citizenship,
has been imprisoned since 2012, where
he has received regular beatings
resulting in severe internal bleeding,
for practicing his Christian
faith.In Burma, anti-Muslim
violence fueled by Buddhist intolerance
and xenophobia has provoked a
humanitarian and human rights disaster
with an estimated 900 Rohingyas fleeing
the country per day. As awful as these
examples of ruthless injustice are,
perhaps nowhere has intolerance and
evil combined to destroy people of
faith more than it has in Iraqand
Syria, where the Islamic State is
engaged in a systemic effort to wipe
out all religious minorities, including
Christians.
Protecting religious freedom
around the world must be a top priority
of our foreign-policy agenda. On this
International Religious Freedom Day, I
encourage all who love freedom to speak
out against these offenses and stand
tall for universal religious freedom. I
also pray that, every American finds
meaningful time to spend with family
and friends in prayer and devotion, and
in thanking God that we live in the
freest country in human
history.
Constituent Casework Corner
Beatrice, who lives in South Florida,
is a divorcee experiencing financial
hardship. Her ex-husband is a federal
retiree and although the retiree annuity
was processed in a timely manner by the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM), her
spousal benefits had been delayed since
March. She contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance. A
member of the staff contacted OPM and
requested an expedited processing due to
her financial hardship. OPM granted the
request and finalized her application
within 60 days. She recently received a
retroactive payment.
