Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
9/11 Memorial Dedication
On Thursday, the 9/11 Memorial Museum was dedicated in New York City,
bringing to mind the words of President George W. Bush in the days
after the tragic terrorist attacks: "We will not tire, we will not
falter, and we will not fail."
Water Resources Conference Report Has Metro-East Levees Funding
I was pleased to join U.S. Senators Mark Kirk (R, Illinois) and Dick
Durbin (D, Illinois), as well as fellow Congressmen Rodney Davis (R,
Illinois-13) and Bill Enyart (D, Illinois-12) in announcing that the
Conference Report of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of
2014
- released Thursday - includes
provisions to continue and streamline the Metro-East region's effort to
repair and recertify the levees that protect residents in southwest
Illinois from flooding and storm damage.
WRRDA is important to the Metro-East not only for the repairs to the
levees but also for the many jobs reliant on our river transportation
system. The local residents behind these levees as well as the
businesses that employee thousands will benefit from the continued
improvement of the levee system.
For his work as a conferee, I particularly salute Congressman Davis,
who noted, "This bipartisan Conference Report is how Congress is
supposed to work. As a conferee tasked with ironing out the final
details of the WRRDA legislation, I am pleased we were able to include
policies that would treat Metro-East levee projects as one system.
Flood prevention is a critical issue, and it is vital to get these
levees recertified. Our goal was to provide the Army Corps with more
flexibility to get the needed repairs done on Metro-East projects, and
we achieved that."
Visit To Flora Recycling Business: Where Need Meets Opportunity
Frequently, I am invited to tour businesses when I am home in the 15th
Congressional District.
They all have a unique story to tell, but few
are as compelling as Secure Processors.
On Wednesday, I visited the traditional and electronic recycler in
Flora (in photo above and with CEO Chris Dickey in photo at right). The
volume of material that is handled each year at Secure Processors - 696
tons of electronics in 2013, for example - is impressive. But perhaps
even more noteworthy is the vocational training and employment the
company provides to individuals with disabilities.
Secure Processors serves businesses and industries in Flora,
Louisville, Clay City, Olney, Salem, and surrounding areas.
Among my other stops last week were Fairfield, where I conducted Open
Office Hours, and Salem, where I spoke to the Chamber of Commerce at
its monthly luncheon.
Announcements
Text-to-911: On May 15, the four largest wireless carriers in the US -
Verizon, AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Sprint - officially began supporting
Text-to-911, a program that lets customers send text messages to
emergency services as an alternative to placing a phone call. In the
future, Text-to-911 will be widely available in the United States.
However, for now, the ability to contact 911 using text is available on
a limited basis in a few markets. In Illinois, it is offered only in
Cook County at this time. More details are at
http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911
.
Help Set Record: On Flag Day, June 14, the Smithsonian will celebrate
the 200th anniversary of the Star-Spangled Banner with a webcast
concert of patriotic music on the National Mall from 1:30-3 p.m.
Central time. The event will culminate at 3 p.m., when everyone is
invited to take part in what is hoped will be the largest mass singing
ever of our national anthem. Learn more at

Business:

perhaps
even
