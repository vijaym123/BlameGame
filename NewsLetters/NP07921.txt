Dear Friend:
Last week, five Republican-appointed men on the Supreme Court decided that bosses have total power to deny critical health care to their employees.
Yesterday, I joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Senator Mark Udall (D-CO) and a group of colleagues from the House and Senate to introduce legislation responding to this outrageous decision.
Under our bill, employers would not get to pick and choose which health benefits their employees will get and which they won't - because your boss should not get to decide what health care is right for you and your family.
