Dear Friend,
The week heading into the Memorial Day weekend featured a number of
issues of great importance to our national defense and to the men and
women who serve and have served our country.
Treatment of our veterans has been a top issue in the news with
allegations of wrongdoing at the VA Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona and
concerns about care being provided at VA facilities elsewhere. This
week the House approved the Department of Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act of 2014, H.R. 4031, to address these concerns and to
help ensure our veterans are receiving the benefits they have earned.
The bill, which I co-sponsor, authorizes the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to remove any individual from the Senior Executive Service upon
determining that his or her performance warrants removal. And it
requires the Secretary to notify the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs
Committees within 30 days of each removal.
If there is truth to allegations of delays in care, destruction of
property, "secret" waiting lists, and purposeful deceptive
record-keeping, it is essential that those involved in the wrong-doing
be removed as quickly as possible. Additionally, anyone accused of
criminal activity must be charged. Our veterans took the solemn pledge
to protect this country and its people. Many served our county in
combat zones, with some of them suffering either physical or emotional
wounds. All deserve the quality treatment befitting of those who stood
up for this country. It is the least we can do to say "thank you."
Mistreatment of our veterans is intolerable. I am committed to making
sure these allegations are addressed appropriately and that, if true,
these acts of mistreatment are not taking place at our VA medical
facilities in Missouri.
Still with military matters, the full House followed the lead of the
House Armed Services Committee in approving the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for the 2015 fiscal year. The bill we passed
takes steps to address limited funding while still making sure our men
and women in uniform have what they need to protect our country.
Some of the highlights of this bill include:
Full funding and maintenance, operation, and upgrading of the A-10
"Warthog" fleet, providing our troops with the close air support that
has saved numerous American lives; rejection for any new round of Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC; funding for the Growler - the nation's
only full spectrum tactical airborne electronic attack aircraft - that
will allow St. Louis-based Boeing to continue the F/A-18 production
line, which supports 60,000 jobs and accounts for $3 billion in
economic impact; it continues funding for long-range strike bomber
research and development; and it maintains TRICARE, military pay, and
benefits for our veterans and current men and women in uniform. For
details on the NDAA, please visit my
website:http://hartzler.house.gov/press-release/congresswoman-hartzler-a
nd-house-armed-services-committee-approve-fy15-national
The NDAA now moves to the Senate.
Still with defense matters, I was honored to host a reception for the
United States Service Academy appointees from Missouri's Fourth
Congressional District. Ten outstanding young people are scheduled to
report to the various service schools this summer to begin their
collegiate academic careers, followed by service to our country as
military officers.
This year's appointees (with his or her respective home town and
Service Academy) are: Simeon Brewster (Belton, U.S. Naval Academy);
Nick Forsythe (Warrensburg, U.S. Air Force Academy); Remington Hoyer
(Warrensburg, U.S. Air Force Academy); Katherine Mason (Waynesville,
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy); Elisha Phillips (Drexel, U.S. Air Force
Academy); Nick Piontek (Warrensburg, U.S. Air Force Academy);
Mason-Wade Reed (Waynesville, U.S. Military Academy); Adrian Shanahan
(Fort Leonard Wood, U.S. Military Academy); Abby Stone (Columbia, U.S.
Naval Academy); and Kimberley Wolfe (Waynesville, U.S. Military
Academy).

I offer them my best wishes and prayers as they begin an exciting new
time in their lives.
On another matter, the House took important action this week by passing
a series of bills aimed at combating the growing problem of human
trafficking in the United States.
Human trafficking is one of the most horrific crimes that exists in the
world today and we must do everything in our power to eliminate this
modern-day slavery. The FBI says that human trafficking is the fastest
growing business of organized crime and the third largest criminal
enterprise in the world. We must stop this heinous crime, and we have
now taken steps to do just that. I am very proud to have co-sponsored
many of the bills we passed and I encourage my colleagues in the Senate
to pass them quickly.
As a mother and strong supporter of adoption, I was especially proud to
co-sponsor and vote for the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving
Opportunities for Youth in Foster Care Act which requires states to
take steps to identify, prevent, and address sex trafficking of youth
in foster care. In 2013, the FBI conducted a human trafficking raid in
which 60 percent of the child sex trafficking victims recovered had
lived in foster care or group homes. This bill will improve the lives
of the over 400,000 youth currently in foster care and give them the
tools they need to become better integrated into society and become
successful adults.
How big a problem is this? The Department of Homeland Security
estimates that human trafficking is a $32 billion industry, as millions
of children, women, and men are trafficked every year around the world
and in the U.S. In the Department of Justice's Western District of
Missouri alone, 15 cases involving human trafficking are currently
being prosecuted. And since 2012, 45 defendants have been prosecuted. I
am pleased to see a bipartisan effort to help address this wrong.
On still another matter, the House this week approved a bipartisan
agreement to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) to
reform bureaucracy, speed up project delivery, and streamline
environmental reviews regarding our nation's water infrastructure.
This WRRDA bill limits most Corps of Engineers feasibility studies to
three years. Currently these studies have no time limit. It streamlines
environmental reviews by requiring the Secretary of the Army to
coordinate with all agencies involved in the environmental review
process, requiring concurrent environmental reviews, and setting
deadlines for the consultative process. And it consolidates and
eliminates duplicative analyses by creating an accelerated process to
allow non-federal project sponsors and the Corps of Engineers to
proceed directly to a feasibility study and repealing a requirement
that the Corps reevaluate cost estimates immediately after initial cost
estimates have been completed.
Waterways and ports help support nearly 25,000 jobs in Missouri. I am
pleased that these WRRDA improvements will provide the opportunity to
make major changes to management of the Missouri River.
I was honored last weekend to deliver the commencement to the graduates
of the University of Missouri's College of Agriculture, Food and
Natural Resources (CAFNR). My message to these young people as they go
forward is that they have been blessed with a world class education -
and the world is going to need them. According to the United Nations,
food production must double by 2050 to meet the demand of the world's
growing population. These University of Missouri graduates will advance
the cause of feeding the world while protecting our resources as they
work together and speak with one voice, advocating the positive message
of agriculture and embracing wise use of technology.

I am proud to represent these fine graduates and the University of
Missouri in Congress. And I was proud to be there on this historic day
in the lives of these young people.
Finally, Americans from coast to coast are beginning the Memorial Day
weekend, which marks the traditional start of the summer vacation
season. As we enjoy family and friends who join us for barbecues and
fun activities, let us not forget the true reason for Memorial Day, a
chance to honor America's fallen military heroes who died in defense of
our country. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to those brave Americans
who gave the last full measure of devotion to keep our country free.
And as we thank them and their families we ask God to continue to keep
watch over our servicemen and women who are protecting us today.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
The
week
heading
into
the
Memorial
Day
weekend
featured
a
number
of
issues
of
great
importance
to
our
national
defense
and
to
the
men
and
women
who
serve
and
have
served
our
country.
Treatment
of
our
veterans
has
been
a
top
issue
in
the
news
with
allegations
of
wrongdoing
at
the
VA
Hospital
in
Phoenix,
Arizona
and
concerns
about
care
being
provided
at
VA
facilities
elsewhere.
This
week
the
House
approved
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act
of
2014 ,
H.R.
4031,
to
address
these
concerns
and
to
help
ensure
our
veterans
are
receiving
the
benefits
they
have
earned.
The
bill,
which
I
co-sponsor,
authorizes
the
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
remove
any
individual
from
the
Senior
Executive
Service
upon
determining
that
his
or
her
performance
warrants
removal.
And
it
requires
the
Secretary
to
notify
the
House
and
Senate
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committees
within
30
days
of
each
removal.
If
there
is
truth
to
allegations
of
delays
in
care,
destruction
of
property,
&#8220;secret&#8221;
waiting
lists,
and
purposeful
deceptive
record-keeping,
it
is
essential
that
those
involved
in
the
wrong-doing
be
removed
as
quickly
as
possible.
Additionally,
anyone
accused
of
criminal
activity
must
be
charged.
Our
veterans
took
the
solemn
pledge
to
protect
this
country
and
its
people.
Many
served
our
county
in
combat
zones,
with
some
of
them
suffering
either
physical
or
emotional
wounds.
All
deserve
the
quality
treatment
befitting
of
those
who
stood
up
for
this
country.
It
is
the
least
we
can
do
to
say
&#8220;thank
you.&#8221;
Mistreatment
of
our
veterans
is
intolerable.
I
am
committed
to
making
sure
these
allegations
are
addressed
appropriately
and
that,
if
true,
these
acts
of
mistreatment
are
not
taking
place
at
our
VA
medical
facilities
in
Missouri.
Still
with
military
matters,
the
full
House
followed
the
lead
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
in
approving
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
for
the
2015
fiscal
year.
The
bill
we
passed
takes
steps
to
address
limited
funding
while
still
making
sure
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
what
they
need

protect
our
country.
Some
of
the
highlights
of
this
bill
include:
Full

and
maintenance,
operation,
and

of
the
A-10
&#8220;Warthog&#8221;

which
supports
60,000

and
accounts
for
$3

The

the
Senate.
Still
with
defense
matters,
I
was
honored
to
host
a
reception
for
the
United
States
Service
Academy
appointees
from
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional

begin
an
exciting
new
time
in
their
lives.
On
another
matter,
the
House
took
important
action
this
week
by
passing
a
series
of
bills
aimed
at
combating
the
growing
problem
of
human
trafficking
in
the
United
States.
Human
trafficking
is
one
of
the
most
horrific
crimes
that
exists
in
the
world
today
and
we
must
do
everything
in
our
power
to
eliminate
this
modern-day
slavery.
The
FBI
says
that
human
trafficking
is
the
fastest
growing
business
of
organized
crime
and
the
third
largest
criminal
enterprise
in
the
world.
We
must
stop
this
heinous
crime,
and
we
have
now
taken
steps
to
do
just
that.
I
am
very
proud
to
have
co-sponsored
many
of
the
bills
we
passed
and
I
encourage
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
to
pass
them
quickly.
As
a
mother
and
strong
supporter
of
adoption,
I
was
especially
proud
to
co-sponsor
and
vote
for
the
Preventing
Sex
Trafficking
and
Improving
Opportunities
for
Youth
in
Foster
Care
Act
which
requires
states
to
take
steps
to
identify,
prevent,
and
address
sex
trafficking
of
youth
in
foster
care.
In
2013,
the
FBI
conducted
a
human
trafficking
raid
in
which
60
percent
of
the
child
sex
trafficking
victims
recovered
had
lived
in
foster
care
or
group
homes.
This
bill
will
improve
the
lives
of
the
over
400,000
youth
currently
in
foster
care
and
give
them
the
tools
they
need
to
become
better
integrated
into
society
and
become
successful
adults.
How
big
a
problem
is
this?
The
Department
of
Homeland
Security
estimates
that
human
trafficking
is
a
$32
billion
industry,
as
millions
of
children,
women,
and
men
are
trafficked
every
year
around
the
world
and
in
the
U.S.
In
the
Department
of
Justice&#8217;s
Western
District
of
Missouri
alone,
15
cases
involving
human
trafficking
are
currently
being
prosecuted.
And
since
2012,
45
defendants
have
been
prosecuted.
I
am
pleased
to
see
a
bipartisan
effort
to
help
address
this
wrong.
On
still
another
matter,
the
House
this
week
approved
a
bipartisan
agreement
to
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA)
to
reform
bureaucracy,
speed
up
project
delivery,
and
streamline
environmental
reviews
regarding
our
nation&#8217;s
water
infrastructure.
This
WRRDA
bill
limits
most
Corps
of
Engineers
feasibility
studies
to
three
years.
Currently
these
studies
have
no
time
limit.
It
streamlines
environmental
reviews
by
requiring
the
Secretary
of
the
Army
to
coordinate
with
all
agencies
involved
in
the
environmental
review
process,
requiring
concurrent
environmental
reviews,
and
setting
deadlines
for
the
consultative
process.
And
it
consolidates
and
eliminates
duplicative
analyses
by
creating
an
accelerated
process
to
allow
non-federal
project
sponsors
and
the
Corps
of
Engineers
to
proceed
directly
to
a
feasibility
study
and
repealing
a
requirement
that
the
Corps
reevaluate
cost
estimates
immediately
after
initial
cost
estimates
have
been
completed.
Waterways
and
ports
help
support
nearly
25,000
jobs
in
Missouri.
I
am
pleased
that
these
WRRDA
improvements
will
provide
the
opportunity
to
make
major
changes
to
management
of
the
Missouri
River.
I
was
honored
last
weekend
to
deliver
the
commencement
to
the
graduates
of
the
University
of
Missouri&#8217;s
College
of
Agriculture,
Food
and
Natural
Resources
(CAFNR).
My
message
to
these
young
people
as
they
go
forward
is
that
they
have
been
blessed
with
a
world
class
education
&#8211;
and
the
world
is
going
to
need
them.
According
to
the
United
Nations,
food
production
must
double
by
2050
to
meet
the
demand
of
the
world&#8217;s
growing
population.
These
University
of
Missouri
graduates
will
advance
the
cause
of
feeding
the
world
while
protecting
our
resources
as
they
work
together
and
speak
with
one
voice,
advocating
the
positive
message
of
agriculture
and
embracing
wise
use
of
technology.

in
Congress.
And
I
was
proud
to
be

on
this
historic
day
in
the
lives
of
these
young
people.
Finally,
Americans
from
coast
to
coast
are
beginning
the
Memorial
Day
weekend,
which
marks
the
traditional
start
of
the
summer
vacation
season.
As
we
enjoy
family
and
friends
who
join
us
for
barbecues
and
fun
activities,
let
us
not
forget
the
true
reason
for
Memorial
Day,
a
chance
to
honor
America&#8217;s
fallen
military
heroes
who
died
in
defense
of
our
country.
We
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
those
brave
Americans
who
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
to
keep
our
country
free.
And
as
we
thank
them
and
their
families
we
ask
God
to
continue
to
keep
watch
over
our
servicemen
and
women
who
are
protecting
us
today.
Have
a
great
week.
