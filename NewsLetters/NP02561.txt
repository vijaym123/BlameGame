Dear Friend,
The FCC has voted to reclassify broadband and mobile networks under Title II of the Communications Act.
In plain English, that means we&rsquo;ve won the battle to protect net neutrality.
This has been a long road, and I want to thank you for walking it with me. Your steadfast support on net neutrality -- and the comments you submitted -- have helped us protect a free and open Internet.
I&rsquo;ve been advocating for net neutrality for years, but it&rsquo;s the work of grassroots supporters like you that really makes the difference. You&rsquo;re the ones who safeguarded the Internet as an engine of innovation and job creation, and a platform for free speech. For that, I want to say thank you.
We&rsquo;ll have other battles to fight soon, but for now, let&rsquo;s enjoy a victory for net neutrality.
Thanks,
Ed
