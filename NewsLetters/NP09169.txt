New Leadership for the Department of Veterans Affairs
Recently, we have heard more and more shocking accounts of
mismanagement, incompetence and corruption come to light that have
contributed to the deterioration in health or even death of some of our
brave veterans, which lead me to call for VA Secretary Shinseki's
resignation
earlier this week.
I am hopeful that his resignation yesterday will turn over a new page
in the care that American veterans are receiving, because they deserve
far better than what they have been getting.
President Obama must name a new Secretary to the Department of Veterans
Affairs who is a strong leader, a proven manager, and who will take
these issues head-on, because our veterans deserve nothing less than
the high quality, timely care they have earned.
Working for Our Veterans
While the resignation of Secretary Shinseki is the first step towards
fixing this broken system, much work remains to be done.
Those who
choose to put on our uniform and serve our country deserve the very
best medical care that we can give them.
Last week, I demanded a full Senatorial investigation of the shameful
treatment our veterans have gotten, and will work diligently to see it
through. Read my letter to the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigation here
.
If you or a loved one has been affected by the VA's failure, my office
wants to help.
My hardworking staff will do whatever they can to
assist you-please contact them here
, electronically or by
telephone.
My staff can also assist South Carolinians who are having
problems with other federal agencies, and are ready to assist you.
Saluting Those Who Served
My mother always says to "give them roses while they're living," and I
have had the privilege of honoring our veterans from WWII
and the Korean War era
for the
past two years in special South Carolina ceremonies.
This year, I am
excited to announce that we will be honoring those who served in the
Vietnam War era at a ceremony on Saturday, August 2, 2014 in Columbia.
All veterans and their families are invited to come and be recognized.
