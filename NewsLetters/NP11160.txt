Affordable Care Act Open Enrollment
Ends March 31
Dear Friend,
I want to take this opportunity to remind you that the deadline for
individuals to start the sign-up process for health insurance through
the Affordable Care Act's Marketplace remains next Monday, March 31.
The Obama Administration announced this week that people who start the
application process but are unable to finish their enrollment by the
deadline will be eligible for an extension. After March 31, you won't
be able to apply until the next open enrollment period begins on
November 15, 2014, unless you experience a qualifying life event
, like
changing jobs, getting married or having a baby.
To apply for health coverage through the Marketplace, compare plans and
enroll online, please visit healthcare.gov
. You can also call the toll-free ACA consumer helpline at
1-800-318-2596 to apply by phone or get answers to your Marketplace
questions.
The Marketplace can help if you do not have coverage now or if you have
it but want to consider other options. Before you shop in the
Marketplace, there are few important things to know:
*	Medicare is not part of the Marketplace. If you have Medicare,
you do not need to change to a Marketplace plan.
*	Children under 26 can stay on a parent's health insurance plan.
*	Some lower-income adults may qualify for coverage under
Pennsylvania's Medicaid plan
.
Since its enactment four years ago, the Affordable Care Act has helped
millions of Americans gain access to affordable, quality health care
and established important consumer protections. Because of the law, up
to 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions - including more
than 5 million Pennsylvanians - can no longer be subject to
discrimination by insurance companies. In addition, individuals and
families no longer have to worry about lifetime or annual limits, and
over 3 million Americans under age 26 - including 91,000 Pennsylvanians
- have gained coverage under their parents' plans.
I encourage you to share this information with your friends and family.
As always, if you require assistance with this or any other federal
issue, please do not hesitate to contact one of my local offices at
215-517-6572 (Abington) or 215-335-3355 (Philadelphia).
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
