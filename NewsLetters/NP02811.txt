Friend,
Childhood vaccination is not an issue that should be politicized- in fact, it endangers our children and communities.
Ultimately, we all want our communities to be safe and healthy, but we can&rsquo;t ignore the facts: vaccines are the most effective tool we have to prevent infectious disease.
Click here to sign your name and stand with Ami to keep our communities healthy.
Those who are in public positions, especially doctors, have a responsibility to share the facts and dispel the rumors.
Vaccines save lives and we all must do our part to educate those in our community.
Thanks for standing with us,
Team Bera
P.S. The American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization encourage vaccinations--
