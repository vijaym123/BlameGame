Friends,
As we gather with friends and family to celebrate
Memorial Day Weekend, we must not get caught up in the fun activities,
food, and yard games.
Instead, spend time with family and friends
reflecting on the sacrifices our nations heroes made for our
freedom. This is a weekend of patriotism and community, a time when our
country comes together to salute the fallen, pray for the standing, and
lift up the grieving.
In honor of Memorial Day, we put
together
video tribute
to
our local heroes and veterans. Thank you again to our veterans, we will
never forget your
service.

Have a good
(and safe!) Memorial Day Weekend,
