REVIEW
In case
you missed it, I gave last weeks Republican address to honor
Independence Day, reflect on the Declaration of Independence, and share our
ongoing mission to ensure Americans have a voice in their government and
their economy.

Bentonville Square,

On
Tuesday, I joined U.S. Senators Mark Pryor and John Boozman, along with
Congressmen Rick Crawford (AR-1), Tim Griffin (AR-2), and Tom Cotton
(AR-4), to send a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Secretary Tom Vilsack in support of Governor Mike Beebes request for federal
disaster assistance for Arkansas farmers and ranchers suffering from
losses caused by severe weather in the state.
Last week, east
Arkansas was hit with flash flooding, which devastated thousands of
acres of crops and pastures.
You can read the full letter
here.
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 803 , the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act.
H.R. 803 reauthorizes the Workforce Investment Act;
streamlines workforce development activities, eliminates 15 duplicative and
ineffective workforce programs, and strengthens the role of states and
local governments in directing workforce development programs.
Additionally, this legislation reauthorizes the Adult Education and
Family Literacy Act to require the integration of basic adult education and
occupational skills training and the use of career pathways.
On Thursday, the
House passed
H.R. 4923 , the Energy and Water
Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015. H.R. 4923
provides funding for the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of
Engineers, and vital national defense nuclear weapons activities. The
legislation provides a total of $34 billion in discretionary funding, which is
$50.5 million below the fiscal year 2014 enacted level and $326.9
million above the Presidents request. The bill prioritizes funding
for national security, providing increases for nuclear weapons
programs above fiscal year 2014, and protects funding for critical national
and regional waterways
like the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River
Navigation System.
On Friday,
the House passed
H.R. 4718 , a bill to amend the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify and make permanent bonus
depreciation. H.R. 4718 makes permanent the 50-percent additional first-year
depreciation deduction for qualified property. Additionally, the
provision expands the definition of qualified property to include
qualified retail improvement property, indexes to inflation the $8,000
increased deduction for certain passenger automobiles, makes permanent
the special rule for allocation of bonus depreciation to a long-term
contract and makes permanent and modifies the election to increase the
AMT credit limitation in lieu of bonus
depreciation.
Next week, in addition to suspensions, the House
will consider H.R. 5016, the Financial Services and General Government
Appropriations Act of 2015, and a package of tax bills from the House
Ways and Means Committee including: the Conservation Easement
Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 2807), the Permanent IRA Charitable Contribution
Act of 2014 (H.R. 4619), the Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014
(H.R. 4719), the Charitable Giving Extension Act (H.R. 3134), the Private
Foundation Excise Tax Simplification Act of 2014 (H.R. 4691), and the
Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (H.R. 5021).
