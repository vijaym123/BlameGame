Ros-Lehtinen: We Need More
Alzheimers Research To Improve The Lives Of Our Seniors, Their
Families
Statements &amp; Speeches
Concerned About Possible Fee Increases with Minimal Public
Input at Everglades National Park, Ros-Lehtinen and Diaz-Balart Send
Letter to Acting Superintendent
Krumenaker
It is concerning that Everglades National Park wants to hike
fees but fails to provide appropriate notice and opportunity for
meaningful public comment that ensures all local park users concerns are
heard and genuinely reviewed. Many of our constituents, and our own
families, enjoy visiting the park and these rate hikes could make regular
family outings to this South Florida treasure cost-prohibitive. We
urge Acting Superintendent Krumenaker to ensure local residents have
ample opportunities to comment on any changes that affect access to their
park.

Miami-Dade Schools
Hall of Fame welcomes seven
inductees
For Ros-Lehtinen, a former educator, the recognition has added
significance. She graduated from Southwest Miami High School and later
became a teacher and then principal of a private bilingual elementary
school in Hialeah.
For an educator, this
is the equivalent of an actress winning an Academy
Award,
Ros-Lehtinen said.
When Ros-Lehtinen was
in school, she never envisioned that her career would take her to
Washington, but she credits her education with giving her the tools to
succeed in a variety of fields.
You never
know where life is going to take you so the best thing you can have is
a solid education so you are in good position no matter where you end
up,"
Ros-Lehtinen said.

Helping Protect Families with Disabled Children,
Ros-Lehtinen Supports the ABLE Act
Many
families with disabled children discover how difficult it is to plan for
their childs adult years, especially when parents and other decision
makers are also grappling with their own health care needs later in
life. Allowing families to establish ABLE accounts will lead to peace of
mind for caregivers and allow disabled children to receive the care
they need in later years.
