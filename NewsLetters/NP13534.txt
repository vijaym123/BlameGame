Friends:
It's been a privilege to
represent Northeast Ohio during my first year in Congress, and I wanted to
share some ways I was able to serve you this year:
My staff and I were able to reach
out and help many through case work, letters, or
calls.

County.)
There's no doubt
that
Washington has plenty of work left to do, but here are a few things I was
able to accomplish my first
year.
One of the best parts
of this job is meeting with local businesses, schools, and families.
All in all, I traveled over 8,000 miles.

meeting with local students about the legislative
process.)
Thanks for taking
the time to read. It's important that I'm hearing from you, so feel
free to visit joyce.house.gov for questions or comments. I hope you and
your family have a safe, happy and healthy holiday. Hope to see you in
2014!
Humbly serving you,
Dave
