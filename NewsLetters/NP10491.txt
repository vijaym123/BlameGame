I wanted to share this press release from the House Judiciary Committee, discussing a letter I signed to Homeland Security Secretary Johnson, asking how many criminal illegal immigrants have been released back into our communities.
I will continue working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to hold the administration accountable and ensure that the law is being followed.
Yours in service,
Randy
House Judiciary Committee Asks DHS for Information on Criminal Aliens Released into Our Communities
Washington, D.C.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Congressman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), and several other members of the House Judiciary Committee today sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary (DHS) Jeh Johnson requesting additional information on criminal aliens identified by Secure Communities and released into communities across the United States, as well as the specific crimes committed by these individuals and the justification for their release. Following Secretary Johnsons testimony before Congress in February, Congressman Smith sent a letter requesting this information; however, almost two months later, the Department has failed to respond.
In the follow-up letter sent today, members of the House Judiciary Committee renewed this request for information and also asked that DHS provide further information on this issue, such as the number of criminal aliens released as a result of the Supreme Courts decision in
Zadvydas v. Davis . The members signing the letter also noted that if DHS does not comply with this request, the Committee will need to schedule a hearing or take other action in order to receive answers to the questions posed to the Department.
In addition to Chairman Goodlatte and Congressman Smith, the
letter was signed by Representatives Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), Howard Coble (R-N.C.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Randy Forbes (R-Va.), Steve King (R-Iowa), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Ted Poe (R-Texas), Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), George Holding (R-N.C.), Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), and Jason Smith (R-Mo.).
