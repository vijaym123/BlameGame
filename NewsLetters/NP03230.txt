Dear
Friend,
In what I call his "NASCAR Speech," his
State of the Union last night, President Obama only took left turns!
And is he honestly taking credit for an oil and gas boom that has
lowered energy prices and helped to grow our economy? He's fought our
energy independence every step of the way, and his executive actions and
veto threats are no call to national unity, which he hoped and prayed
for in his speech.
In my rebuttal, I
deliver a message from independent, hard-working Northeast Georgians.
Please
watch the video
below, describing my work for
independent and community pharmacies in the Ninth District, the
religious freedom of military chaplains and also spending and tax cuts that
empower every Georgian.

Rebuttal

homeowners association, civic group or community event in Northeast Georgia,
please visit

to schedule a time. I look forward to meeting you in
person!
