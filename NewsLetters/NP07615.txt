David, that&rsquo;s how much a minimum wage worker earns in Illinois.
Despite working backbreaking hours, many of our neighbors are struggling to keep their heads above water. And all the while, the income gap grows larger and larger. It&rsquo;s just not right.
That&rsquo;s why Cheri&rsquo;s fighting to raise the federal minimum wage. She knows the hardworking families of Illinois don&rsquo;t deserve to live in poverty while the rich just get richer. If you agree the system is rigged, we need to hear from you. Will you sign your name to Cheri&rsquo;s petition calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage?
Providing a fair, livable wage is just plain common sense. Not only would it benefit working families, it would stimulate the economy.
That&rsquo;s why the American people overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage.
