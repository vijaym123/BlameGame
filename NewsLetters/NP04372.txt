Dear Friends,
Congress is back in what is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Lame Duck Session&rsquo;. With less than ten legislative days before the New Year, a number of vital issues await action. From immigration, ISIL and the budget to the tax code and infrastructure,
you deserve to know the facts about what we will be debating over the next few weeks - and in the 114th Congress.
On Tuesday, November 25th, I will be hosting a community forum from 6PM-8PM at East Hartford High School
on both the Lame Duck Session and the new, incoming Congress. I look forward to providing you with the latest facts on major issues faced by Washington now and over the next two years,
as well as information on the makeup of our new Congress.
As always, you will also be provided an opportunity to ask questions throughout.
LAME DUCK &amp; THE 114th CONGRESS COMMUNITY FORUM
Tuesday, November 25, 6PM-8PM
East Hartford High School, East Lecture Hall
869 Forbes Street, East Hartford, CT 06118
Map it!
Please
RSVP online
or by calling my office at 860-278-8888. I look forward to speaking with you and bringing your thoughts back to Congress.
Sincerely,
