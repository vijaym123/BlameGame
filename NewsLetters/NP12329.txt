David --
I want to hear about what&rsquo;s important to you, David.
My job is to work hard and improve the lives of my neighbors here in Illinois -- but sometimes the gridlock in Washington can distract from what&rsquo;s most important.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going straight to the source: YOU. There is no one more qualified to tell me about the issues that are impacting your families than you. Will you click on the link below to take our survey and tell us what matters most to you? Click here to take our Illinois Issues Survey to let us know what matters most to you and your family &gt;&gt;
A true grassroots campaign is powered by the people. That&rsquo;s why I want to hear from you -- so that I can better serve my constituents in 2014 and beyond.
