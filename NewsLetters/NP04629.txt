Dear Friends,
November marks National Diabetes Month.
Many in our community are, unfortunately, all too familiar with
diabetes either because they suffer from it or know someone who does.
Today, nearly 30 million Americans are affected by diabetes, and
another 86 million are at risk for developing it.
This month provides
us all with a great opportunity to renew our dedication to the battle
against this life-threatening illness, one that impacts far too many
of our friends and neighbors.
Recently, I co-signed a
letter to the Department of Health and Human Services expressing my support
for updated diabetes screening guidelines.
These stronger guidelines would allow health professionals to improve their
screening for diabetes by targeting high risk populations that have
multiple risk factors for the disease.
However, action against
diabetes should always start at home.
There are things you can do
to reduce your risk of suffering from this disease.
According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, adding thirty
minutes of physical activity to your day and committing to a healthier
diet can drastically lower the risk of developing
diabetes.
I encourage you to play a part in combating diabetes by learning
the facts and risks associated with this disease. Adopting a healthy
diet and exercise regimen as part of your daily life will also ensure
you and your family lower your risk of diabetes.
