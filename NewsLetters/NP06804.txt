Dear
Friends,
There's a lot of work to
be done in Washington, but
since Congress has been back
in their home districts this
month, I've been able to
travel up and down Delaware
to see the incredible work
Delawareans have been
accomplishing in the First
State.
On August 5, I joined
officials from the Town of
Smyrna to kick-off the
expansion of the new Smyrna
police station. Funding for
this project was made
available through the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's
(USDA) Rural Development loan
program. We rely on our
police officers to keep us
safe - we owe it to them to
provide the facilities and
tools they need. The federal
support from USDA will bring
all the Smyrna police
officers under one roof and
help them serve the community
more efficiently.
Later that week, I visited
the NASA Wallops Flight
Facility in Virginia. Wallops
contractors and NASA have
partnered with numerous
Delaware companies and
universities to create
cutting-edge technology that
will keep our economy on the
move. It was a wonderful
opportunity to see the work
that the folks at Wallops are
doing and I'm excited for
their continued partnership
with Delaware in the
future.
On August 18, I joined
Senator Chris Coons and
Representative John Carney to
cut the ribbon and celebrate
the opening of the Westside
Family Dental Center in
Dover. Westside is a
federally qualified health
center serving all three
counties in Delaware. The
center received a federal
grant through the Affordable
Care Act and will provide
thousands of Delawareans with
the care they need.
On August 21, I had the
chance to tour the Sussex
County Airport. Through
federal, state and local
funding, the main runway was
expanded to 5,500 feet and
critical upgrades were made
around the facility. The
project will make the airport
accessible to larger
aircraft, improve safety and
accessibility and bolster the
Sussex County economy.
I have had the chance to
catch up with some impressive
Delawareans over the past few
weeks, but one of my most
memorable experiences has
been connecting with our
state's veterans. Earlier
this week, I teamed up with
the Delaware Delegation to
host a jobs fair for veterans
in Milford. Nearly 100
veterans came out to check
out the resources offered by
over 35 employers and
organizations, all hiring for
jobs in the public, private
and non-profit sector.
Our next
job
fair for veterans
will be
held on Monday, August 25,
2014 from 10:00 a.m. to 2
p.m. at the Middle Town
Volunteer Hose Company, 27 W.
Green St. in
Middletown.
If you
know someone who fought for
our country and is looking
for employment help us spread
the word!
