Statement Marking the
Anniversary of 9/11
9/11/14
No matter how many
anniversaries of remembrance come and go, each one must be a sacred
reminder of the heroism and valor displayed by so many on that fateful
day. 9/11 must also serve as a cautionary tale that illustrates for us
that there are real dangers and true evils in the world, ready,
willing, and able to strike at a moments notice. That is why we must remain
eternally vigilant and mindful of the realities of this world. Please
join me in a moment of prayer and mourning for the innocent lives lost
and also join me in a prayer of thanks for the brave men and women,
both seen and unseen, defending us
today.
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
