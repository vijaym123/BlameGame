Dear David,
Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a day when we remember a man dedicated to the ideals of justice, peace, and equal opportunity for all. Dr. King led a movement that has changed all of our lives for the better, for when oppression and hate exists anywhere in our communities, we all suffer.
But even more admirable than what Dr. King did was how he did it. Dr. King&rsquo;s insistence on a non-violent and peaceful revolution should act as an example to all of us who today find ourselves in political disagreements. Dr. King showed us how effective we can be when we push for change civilly, when we disagree with respect, and when we treat others how we would want to be treated.
Just this past year, we came together as a country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of The March on Washington. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Dr. King spoke of his dream of a better world for his children. When I go to work every day, I think about the world I&rsquo;m hoping to help shape for my kids and the kids of Hoosier parents everywhere across our state.
Let&rsquo;s start working today on improving how we work together as a country. When we disagree, we have to start doing so in a manner more worthy of the great leaders like Dr. King who have come before us.
We are a stronger nation when we work hand in hand.
Thank you for remembering the life of Martin Luther King Jr. today.
Sincerely,
Senator Joe Donnelly
