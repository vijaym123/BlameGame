Dear Friend:
Anyone who knows California knows that we have forever fought about water and it's time to change the story. That's why today, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congresswoman Grace Napolitano, Congressman Peter DeFazio and I introduced "W21: Water in the 21st Century," legislation which will help us prepare for the future by conserving, recycling and better managing our precious water supplies. To learn more about our legislation, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
