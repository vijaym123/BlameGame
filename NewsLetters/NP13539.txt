As a
father of four, I always look forward to the holiday season and
welcome this time to remember the importance of family and community and
celebrate what we are thankful
for.
As your Representative, I am committed to working for Montana families
and fighting for policies that encourage job creation and economic
growth so we can better provide for those we love. Unfortunately, more
than twenty million Americans are either unable to find any work or
have become so discouraged that they have quit
looking.
It is deeply troubling that our economic
challenges are hurting hardworking Montanans.
With the holiday season
underway, it is my hope to hear from you on how the economy has affected
you and your family during this special time of year. Please take a
moment to answer the question below so I can better serve
you.

economy affected the holiday season for you and your
