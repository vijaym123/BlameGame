Dear Friend,
The Affordable Care Act was a huge victory in the fight to expand reproductive health services for women. Health insurance companies are now required by law to provide reproductive health care -- like birth control -- at little to no out-of-pocket cost. But according to recent studies, some insurance companies are ignoring that requirement.
We cannot allow insurance companies to get away with flagrantly ignoring the Affordable Care Act. Women -- and the families they support -- deserve access to this critical care. I&rsquo;m working with my colleagues to correct this situation and we need your help. Demand that insurance companies follow the law and provide comprehensive healthcare for women.
The problem here runs even deeper than non-compliance. A recent survey showed that many women aren&rsquo;t even aware that they have the right to no-cost contraceptive care -- and they&rsquo;re being misinformed by certain health care providers, insurance companies, and pharmacies.
The Affordable Care Act laid out the requirements -- now we have to make sure those requirements are being enforced. That&rsquo;s why I, along with a few of my colleagues, sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, urging them to take action. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you to take action today. Add your name to mine and demand insurance companies provide the care women need.
Thank you for your help on this.
