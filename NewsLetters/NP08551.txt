Dear Friends,
I'd like to wish each and
every one of you a very happy West Virginia Day. I've recorded a
special video message I'd like to share with you about this important
holiday:

CHILDHOOD
CANCER RESEARCH
I've cosponsored legislation to
improve and expand federal research into childhood
cancers.
H.R. 2607, the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer
Reauthorization Act, would help expand the development of treatments and
potential cures for childhood cancer. Caroline Pryce Walker, daughter of
former Rep. Deborah Price (R-Ohio), died of neuroblastoma at age 9 in
1999.
As a member of the Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus,
I'm committed to helping improve the care and research of cancers
affecting children. Childhood cancer research has progressed in the last
five years, and this important reauthorization would allow federal
research efforts to expand and improve. Children with cancer need
specific treatments and approaches, and cancer and its treatments often
respond differently in children versus adults. This legislation would
expand opportunities for research and improve childrens lives, and I am
proud to support this important research.
CONGRESSIONAL AWARD GOLD MEDAL
Aarthy Shah (above, left) of
Vienna, West Virginia, has received the Congressional Award Gold Medal
for her volunteer work at a local hospital. I was pleased to
congratulate her and welcome her extended family to Washington on Wednesday.
Congratulations again, Aarthy.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation
on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
