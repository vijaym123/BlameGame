Local Construction Firm to Design New VA
Cemetery
3/4/15
The Department of Veterans
Affairs has achieved a critical milestone for the new Southern Colorado
National Cemetery with the award of the Architect Engineer Design
Contract to AES Group, Inc.
AES Group, Inc. is a service disabled
veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) based in Colorado that has been
providing quality engineering services since 1988.
Having a
veteran owned company that is a part of our local community will insure this
new cemetery properly meets the needs of our veterans.
This
design contract will develop the master plan for 125,000 grave sites
across a 375 acre site as well as schematic documents for approximately 45
acres of the property to support 10 year burial projects
(approximately 13,300 gravesites) for the Phase 1 build out.
The cemetery
will include a main entrance area, combined public information center
and administration building, memorial walls, honor guard building,
pre-placed crypts, columbarium niches and in-ground cremains vaults.
All facilities will be Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) silver certified which insures sustainability is factored into
every aspect of the design.
