South Florida advocate pushes Congress for action in
assisting poor, ailing Holocaust
survivors
U.S.
Rep.
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen , the Miami Republican who chairs one of the subcommittees,
said more can and must be
done.
With the
average age of Holocaust survivors estimated at 82, time is truly
running out for us to bring them some form of justice, some kind of
closure so that they can live out the rest of their days in dignity and
comfort, she said in her prepared
statement.

Survivors Continue to Endure Hardships Long After
the Atrocities of the Holocaust; Congress and the U.S. Government Must
Do More to Ensure They Receive Their Long Overdue Justice, Says
Ros-Lehtinen
September 18, 2014
"Struggling to make ends meet and still fighting to correct
the injustices of the past, it is important to hear from Holocaust
Survivors and their relatives as they share their stories and the daily
struggles that they face as they seek to live out the remainders of
their lives in security and dignity
is that too much to
ask?
ICHEIC has let Holocaust survivors down no matter how the members
of ICHEIC spin this, so it is up to us in Congress to step-up and help
the survivors."

Islamic State threat prompts effort to boost Middle East arms
deliveries
The chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs
panel on the Middle East will shortly be introducing legislation to
increase military aid while easing roadblocks to arms sales to the
Hashemite Kingdom, Al-Monitor has learned. Despite being introduced at the
tail end of the legislative session, the bill from Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., is seen as having a real chance of passing in December
as an amendment to the must-pass National Defense Authorization
Act.
"It should be the policy of the United
States to support the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its response to the
Syrian refugee crisis, provide necessary assistance to alleviate the
domestic burden to provide basic needs for the assimilated Syrian
refugees, cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat from the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or other terrorist
organizations, and help secure the border between Jordan and its neighbors Syria
and Iraq," the bill
states.

Ahead of Next Weeks United Nations General
Assembly, Ros-Lehtinen Introduces Two Bills Aimed at Inducing Reforms
Within Two of the UNs Most Broken
Bodies
September 18,
2014
"The fact that Hamas missiles were found under at least three
UNRWA run schools reaffirms a troubling pattern that shows that UNRWA has
been remarkably and dangerously inattentive to what is going on inside
its facilities, it was willing to turn a blind eye, or both. The
United States has been the largest contributor to UNRWA - with the
American taxpayers having been on the hook for nearly $300 million last year
alone - and therefore has a responsibility to ensure that our funds
are not aiding Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization. The
only way we can ensure we are not complicit in the aiding of Hamas
through UNRWA is to withhold our funds from that body until such a time in
which it severs all ties with Hamas, takes accountability for its
actions and is completely transparent and above water with all of its
operations in Gaza."
