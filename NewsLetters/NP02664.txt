WEEK IN
REVIEW
Last week, I
joined Senators Boozman and Cotton, along with Congressmen Crawford
(AR-1), Hill (AR-2), and Westerman (AR-4), to send a letter to President
Obama urging him to resolve contract negotiations between the dock
workers union and shipowners at West Coast ports because of the negative
economic consequences its having on Arkansas businesses. Over the
weekend, the President sent Labor Secretary Tom Perez to help the sides
reach an agreement.
Contract negotiations between the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), the union that represents
the dockworkers, and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) have been
ongoing since spring of 2014, a nd the ensuing
stalemate has been
causing disruptions in service
across the whole country. If an agreement is not reached between
the two parties, West Coast ports could shut down. The National Retail
Federation warns that this could cost the U.S. economy approximately $2
billion a day. The
full text of the letter can be found here .
This week, the House will
had its first district work period of the 114th Congress, and I spent
it traveling throughout the Third District.
On Wednesday, I headed to Springdale. I started
off my day with a complete tour of South Coast Baking Company's
modern facilities and saw how they produce frozen cookie dough! I also
visited the Cross Church Compassion Center and got to witness firsthand
the good work they do for the people of Northwest Arkansas. I wrapped up
the day at the Springdale School of Innovation, where I participated
in Real World Wednesday. Thanks to the extremely impressive students
for inviting me to come speak to you and for celebrating my birthday
with me!

visit to the School of Innovation

My Thursday was spent in the River Valley. My first top was
Gerdau in Fort Smith to see their steel mill, which operates 24-7 to
produce over 500,000 tons of steel billets every year. Afterwards, I
joined the Fort Smith Regional Chamber at their monthly board meeting. I
also visited Van Buren High School Freshman Academy, where I met with
the young men and women in the Army JROTC program and the student
council. Read more about my visit
in this Times Record article .
The highlight of my day in Fort
Smith was presenting the Congressional Gold Medal to Master Sergeant
Manford B. Redifer of Hackett, Arkansas, for his service in the
Civi l
Air Patrol (CAP) during World War
II. The CAP was founded six days before Pearl Harbor. Within three months
of the attack, CAP members were using their own planes to fly
anti-submarine missions and escort convoys to safety. Manny as he is known
to friends and family, volunteered with the South Bend CAP squadron in
1942. He and eight members of his unit purchased a J-3 Cub
on which
he learned to fly
to join in the CAPs voluntary efforts to
discourage and eventually stop U-boat attacks, patrol the U.S. border by air,
conduct search and rescue missions, and provide disaster relief and
emergency transport. In October 1943, Manny was drafted by the United
States Air Force and continued to serve our country with dignity until
1982, when MSG Redifer retired from the Air Force Reserves. Over his
many years of service, he was awarded the Philippine Liberation Medal,
along with numerous unit citation awards.
There is no more noble or honorable profession
than to serve your nation and the flag and to protect America and the
values for which she stands. But yesterday, we honored Manny for
his voluntary service before his military career
as a member of the
Civil Air Patrol. It was humbling to award him with this long-due
recognition and present him with the Congressional Gold Medal. You can
read more about Manny and yesterdays medal presentation
in
the
Democrat-Gazette
and
the Times Record .
Today, I hosted Coffee with the Congressman in
Bella Vista. THANK YOU to all those who came out! We had a great crowd
and great questions. I appreciate you taking time out of your morning
to share coffee with me.
Next week, its back to Washington. Until
then
From the
Front...
