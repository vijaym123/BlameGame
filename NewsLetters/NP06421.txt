Washington Should Promote Business-Friendly Reforms
Each year on Labor Day we honor the hardworking Americans who form the backbone of our economy. Last week at Milwaukees Laborfest, President Obama touted that over 200,000 new jobs have been created each month over the past six months. But it appears the President spoke too soon.
Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added only 142,000 jobs in August, significantly less than the 200,000 jobs the President flaunted days earlier. In fact, August marks the lowest level of jobs added this year.
It is time to pursue sustainable ways to boost our economy without deterring employers from hiring.
Burdening job creators with high taxes and red tape is not the solution. In an annual survey, Wisconsin business owners were asked what would improve Wisconsins business climate and 23 percent said tax cuts, while 18 percent said regulatory relief. In the same survey, 33 percent said economic slowdown was the top business concern facing their companies. To keep unelected bureaucrats from stalling economic growth, Washington should promote business-friendly reforms and get Americans back to work.
The Wisconsin economy relies heavily on the manufacturing and agriculture industries. The manufacturing industry currently accounts for one-fifth of Wisconsins economy. Its 9,400 manufacturers employ over 450,000 people, making up 17 percent of the states workforce. We were ranked fifth in the nation for manufacturing job creation from 2009-2012. We should support educating a skilled workforce to allow employees to expand their careers and climb the ladder while giving employers the flexibility to grow their businesses.
The agriculture industry generates another 10 percent of our states workforce. Over 354,000 Wisconsinites rely directly on agriculture for their jobs. Farming generates over $59 billion annually for our state and the Fifth District alone has over 3,400 farms that contribute over $600 million to Wisconsins economy. Most of Wisconsin farms are family-owned and the number of farms in Wisconsin decreased by more than 10 percent from 2007-2012. Washington should adopt pro-growth policies that expand export opportunities and allow farmers to keep more of their hard earned money so they are able to make critical investments in their operations to stay competitive.
Increasing costs and regulations for businesses is not the right solution for our economy. Despite the Presidents shortsighted fiscal strategy, we must protect incentives to work hard while creating solutions that create economic stability and reduce the tax burden on American businesses and families.
