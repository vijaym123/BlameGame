Dear friend,
Over the weekend, our nation took a
moment to celebrate Flag Day as well as the
U.S. Army's 240th birthday.It is very
appropriate these two holidays fall on the
same day
honoring the birthday of
the men and women who serve on behalf of
the Stars and Stripes. Those who
volunteer to protect us and the freedoms
that make America unique represent the
greatest this country has to offer.
It is because of their bravery and actions
that we are free and they deserve nothing
but the best. I will continue my
efforts to provide the best quality care
that our veterans deserve, which entails
cleaning up the VA. I invite you to
read my
weekly
column
on the reorganization (or lack
thereof) of the VA.
Medal of Honor Ceremony at Ohio
Veterans Memorial Park
To personally pay tribute to these two
national holidays, I took a moment to honor
a veteran very close to my heart, my father
Evo Renacci. While he was not a
member of the U.S. Army, he wore our
nations uniform in the Armed Forces
as a Navy man. I laid a brick etched
with his name and service to our country in
Clintons Ohio Veterans
Memorial Park (pictured below).
Afterwards, I had the privilege of
recognizing three Medal of Honor recipients
- Corporal Ronald Rosser, Staff Sergeant
Howard Woodford, and Corporal Hershel
Woody Williams (pictured
below) at the park. The Medal of
Honor is our countrys highest medal
for valor that can be awarded to members of
the Armed Forces, and Ohio has a proud
history of Medal of Honor recipients
the first six were awarded to
Ohioans. Thank you to all the men and
women who have shown extraordinary valor in
service to our nation.
Ohioans Need a Long-Term
Infrastructure Solution
It was great to see so many friendly
faces at Ohio Veterans' Memorial
Parkto kick off the week. It
helps to keep my to-do list fresh as I head
back to the nations capital, and
represent you in Congress. On
Wednesday, the Ways &amp; Means Committee
held a hearing on the Highway Trust Fund
an issue that is vital to
maintaining the infrastructure of our
nation. Without a strong
infrastructure
the lifeline to our
communities
our economy weakens
because people cannot travel to work and
our products fail to be transported.
This is why we need a long-term solution to
this issue. No more short-term
patches, but rather a solution that stops
putting the burden of paying for the roads
we use today on the backs of our children
and grandchildren. At the hearing I
discussed my long-term, bipartisan bill:
Bridge
to Sustainable Infrastructure Act
to
fix our deteriorating roads and bridges,
once and for all. We cannot afford to
kick the can down the road any longer for
the sake of Ohios roads,
communities, and welfare. It is
time
to save our infrastructure . Click

about the hearing and watch my strong
support for a long-term solution to
Ohios infrastructure.
Ohios History Day Teacher of
the Year
Congratulations to Ohios History
Day Teacher of the Year, Frank
OGrady (pictured below), from Rocky
River. National History Day (NHD) is
a nonprofit education organization that
engages over half of a million middle and
high school students around the world in
conducting history research
projects. Mr. OGrady
started Rocky Rivers National
History Day club in 2014, and in one short
year tripled its size from 40 students to
120. Colleagues of Frank say that
he is a devoted educator who has an
incredible ability to develop
students interest in history
and I witnessed this dedication when I had
the privilege of sitting down with him this
week. I am proud to say that you are
an Ohioan and are educating our future
leaders
thank you.
That is all for my
Renacci Report
this week. It
is an honor representing you in Congress
and I will continue my efforts working
towards a long-term solution to fix
Ohios infrastructure.
Have a great weekend,
