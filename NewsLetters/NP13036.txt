FROM THE DESK OF CONGRESSMAN YOHO
Friends,
Last week the House of Representatives voted on H.R. 3811, the Health
Exchange Security and Transparency Act, legislation to ensure that
victims of breaches of security as a result of the healthcare.gov
website are notified within 48 hours. It is astonishing to me that this
website would be built without proper security as the paramount
concern. I am not in favor of the Affordable Care Act, however, forcing
Americans to put their information on a website where their security
could be compromised is absolutely egregious.
To know of these concerns and to move forward with the website anyway
is the height of irresponsibility. For that reason, I have introduced
legislation that would hold the Secretary of Health and Human Services
accountable for breaching the public trust by moving forward with a
faulty website. The Government Lacks Insight To Choose Healthcare
(GLITCH) Act reduces the salary of the Secretary of HHS by a percentage
each month that the website is not operational. This bi-partisan bill
is a step in holding elected officials accountable for negligence under
their purview.
The creation of a website where Americans are expected to enter
personal information without security as a primary feature is
negligence pure and simple. For that reason, the Secretary of HHS
should be held accountable. Any other CEO or company president would be
under fire for such carelessness. Elected officials should be held to
the same regard, and they should be accountable to you. Identity theft
has lasting and far-reaching effects and to have your information
forcibly compromised by your government is an offense that should be
penalized. It is my hope that even proponents of this law can
understand the anger and concern many Americans have over putting their
personal information onto healthcare.gov or any of the exchanges. As
more legislation is introduced that will protect you from these ill
effects, rest assured I will keep you informed.
Take care,
Ted

FROM
THE
DESK
OF
CONGRESSMAN
YOHO
Friends,
Last
week
the
House
of
Representatives
voted
on
H.R.
3811,
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act,
legislation
to
ensure
that
victims
of
breaches
of
security
as
a
result
of
the
healthcare.gov
website
are
notified
within
48
hours.
It
is
astonishing
to
me
that
this
website
would
be
built
without
proper
security
as
the
paramount
concern.
I
am
not
in
favor
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
however,
forcing
Americans
to
put
their
information
on
a
website
where
their
security
could
be
compromised
is
absolutely
egregious.
To
know
of
these
concerns
and
to
move
forward
with
the
website
anyway
is
the
height
of
irresponsibility.
For
that
reason,
I
have
introduced
legislation
that
would
hold
the
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
accountable
for
breaching
the
public
trust
by
moving
forward
with
a
faulty
website.
The
Government
Lacks
Insight
To
Choose
Healthcare
(GLITCH)
Act
reduces
the
salary
of
the
Secretary
of
HHS
by
a
percentage
each
month
that
the
website
is
not
operational.
This
bi-partisan
bill
is
a
step
in
holding
elected
officials
accountable
for
negligence
under
their
purview.
The
creation
of
a
website
where
Americans
are
expected
to
enter
personal
information
without
security
as
a
primary
feature
is
negligence
pure
and
simple.
For
that
reason,
the
Secretary
of
HHS
should
be
held
accountable.
Any
other
CEO
or
company
president
would
be
under
fire
for
such
carelessness.
Elected
officials
should
be
held
to
the
same
regard,
and
they
should
be
accountable
to
you.
Identity
theft
has
lasting
and
far-reaching
effects
and
to
have
your
information
forcibly
compromised
by
your
government
is
an
offense
that
should
be
penalized.
It
is
my
hope
that
even
proponents
of
this
law
can
understand
the
anger
and
concern
many
Americans
have
over
putting
their
personal
information
onto
healthcare.gov
or
any
of
the
exchanges.
As
more
legislation
is
introduced
that
will
protect
you
from
these
ill
effects,
rest
assured
I
will
keep
you
informed.
