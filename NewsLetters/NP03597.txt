Thune Eager to Work with New South Dakota
Delegation
U.S. Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and
Representative Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) joined for the first photo in the
114 th
Congress of the new South Dakota delegation Wednesday
morning in Washington,
D.C.
The United States Senate is back in session in Washington for the
114th Congress, and on Tuesday the newest member of the South Dakota
delegation, Senator Mike Rounds, was sworn into office.
Senator
Thune is eager to get to work with Senator Rounds and Representative Noem
to advance a number of important South Dakota priorities during this
session of Congress.
South Dakota
hasnt had an all-Republican Congressional delegation since 1962.
Additionally, the last time Republicans held the majority in both chambers
of Congress and South Dakota had an all GOP delegation was 1953.
South Dakotans stand to
benefit from Republican policies that create jobs, reduce federal regulatory
overreach, stimulate the economy, and get Washingtons legislative
process working again.
Senator Thune is looking forward to
fighting for South Dakota priorities in a Senate that functions and having a
partner in Mike Rounds who will help chart a path forward for our
state in the Senate.
