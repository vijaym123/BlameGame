Dear friend,
Thanksgiving is a day reserved to gather with loved ones and give thanks for our many blessings. As we do, let us also remember the men and women serving our country overseas, who will be away from their families this holiday. Their service allows us to celebrate in peace.
From my family to yours, I wish you all the best this Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
Steve Chabot
Member of Congress
