Protecting our Pollinators
As National Pollinator Week comes to a close on Sunday, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is working to protect Ohio pollinators &mdash; from honey bees to monarch butterflies.
Pollinators play an essential role in productive farming &mdash; without pollinators much of our food supply would be at risk.
They help produce higher yields for all crops, from corn to cauliflower, but are increasingly at risk.
Colony collapse disorder has killed more than one billion honey bees in Ohio and has cost our state&rsquo;s specialty crop farmers more than $80 million in lost revenue a year.
While it is unclear what is causing colony collapse, we know that protecting honeybee populations is critically important.
This year, Sen. Brown served on the conference committee for the 2014 Farm Bill, which included important provisions to protect pollinator habitats as well as emergency assistance for honeybee producers.
Sen. Brown also supported U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s proposal for $25 million towards a pollinator health institute which would bring together the resources of the public and private sectors to examine the issue.
Sen. Brown has also applauded the Administration&rsquo;s new National Strategy to address pollinators.
The strategy is aimed at increasing research on pollinator health and enhancing habitats for pollinators, such as the migratory monarch butterfly.
Buzzing around from field to field, pollinators play a crucial, but overlooked, part in Ohio agriculture.
Sen. Brown is working to ensure we research ways to address colony collapse while continuing to support existing research and resources.
