URGENT: CONTROL OF CONGRESS IS AT STAKE Today's ad buy deadline may be our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
The election is in 7 days. That's just 7 days left to shock the world! NO ONE SAW THIS COMING:
Our latest polls show we can beat the Republicans -- even in blood-red states like Arkansas and West Virginia and Nebraska. And thanks to everyone who&rsquo;s pitched in, we&rsquo;re only 7,5OO donations from staging last-minute offensives in these too-close-to-call races!
But there&rsquo;s almost no time left. Our final week ad buy deadline is in 12 hours.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
