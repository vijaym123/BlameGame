Dear
Friends,
Another day, another confirmation that
Obamacare is a train wreck.
Late Friday afternoon, the non-partisan Chief Actuary of the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quietly released an explosive
report
that shows health care premiums will go up
for two-thirds of American small businesses as a result of
Obamacare.
The administration claimed
that that under Obamacare, Americans could expect premiums to go down by
as much as $2,500. The reality as confirmed by the report, is that at
least 11 million small businesses employees will see premiums go up
rather than see them go down under
Obamacare.
It is time for the administration to come to terms with
what you and I already know. What was termed the Affordable Care
Act has proven to be the exact opposite. Obamacare is causing increased
premiums and making it more difficult for our economy to create jobs.
This is not what the American people were
promised.
While the Obama administration may not be
listening, I am. Please see the survey to the right of this page to submit
your story on how Obamacare is affecting you or your
family.
