The gates of history turn on very small
hinges
On October 15, I was honored to present the family of
World War I veteran, Encarnacion Trujillo, with several high honor awards
for his service prior to September of 1939, during a ceremony at the
Salt Lake City Veteran's Cemetery.
Encarnacion's
daughter, Yvonne Shields, contacted my office with information proving
that he took shrapnel to the shoulder during his service, which she
believed earned him a Purple Heart. After submitting the documents to the
United States Army, we learned that in addition to the Purple Heart,
Trujillo had earned World War I Victory Medal with Muse-Argonne Battle
Clasp and France Service Clasp, the World War I Victory Button-Silver
and the Lapel Button.
While this remembering by our nation has been
slow in coming, As Encarnaction Trujillo would be 119 years old, I sense
that he would be pleased at recieving this Purple Heart Medal
today.
Like so many of his generation he didnt fight so his name would
appear in the newspaper or be recorded in a history book, he fought so
his children could pursue their dreams and write their own histories
in a land of freedom and opportunity.
Encarnaction
Trujillo was part of the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which was
fought from late September through November of 1918.
The battle is
largely a forgotten one though it was one of the largest in American
history.
Over 26,000 Americans were killed and 96,000 were injured
in the fierce and bloody battle that occurred there.
Mr.
Trujillo was wounded in his right shoulder during the fight when he was hit
by shrapnel.
Some might say he was just one man
among the legions who fought in that great battle
but I say - he was one
man.
The gates of history turn on very small hinges and those
hinges turn on the courage and commitment of inspired individuals like
Mr. Trujillo.
Submit a Photo for my #HonorUtahVeterans Photo
Gallery
As we approach Veterans Day on November 11, I am creating a
photo gallery display in my Senate office memorializing the service of
Utahs veterans.
If you are one of the brave Americans who has
served or is serving, or if you are the friend or family member of a
veteran - you are invited to share a photograph on Instagram that captures
their commitment to country and their willingness to sacrifice.
(Photos may be historical from their period of active duty or a present day
picture showcasing their spirit, pride, honor and
legacy.)
Please help me remember and honor those who have stood tall for
freedom and inspire the next generation of Americans to do the same.
