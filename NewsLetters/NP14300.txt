Dear Friends,
Did you know that a gun purchased by a woman for someone else is twice as likely to be involved in a crime?
This is known as a "straw purchase" and it's one of the most common ways guns are funneled to criminals through illegal gun pipelines. Too often, these women are bullied by their boyfriends, male friends or family members to buy guns for them because they have a criminal record and cannot pass a background check. Even if a woman doesn't pull the trigger, she could provide the gun that ends someone's life. In many cases, she has no idea that these transactions are illegal and have lethal consequences.
LIPSTICK is a new initiative to disrupt this cycle of violence in our communities. LIPSTICK stands for Ladies Involved in Putting a Stop to Inner-City Killing and was launched by a coalition of public health, law enforcement and social service organizations. I invite you to learn more about this serious public health issue at a forum, &ldquo;Empowering Women to Stop Illegal Gun Trafficking: A New Public Health Approach,&rdquo; on
Friday, November 22, 2013 from 3:00 &ndash; 4:30 pm at the San Mateo City Council Chambers.

I will be joined by David Hemenway, Director of the Harvard Injury Research Control Center, David Chipman, former ATF agent, Nancy Robinson, Executive Director of Citizens for Safety and ST Mayer, San Mateo County Health System Director of Policy and Planning. They will share the research that shows that women are disproportionately involved in the purchase of crime guns. Women are particularly vulnerable to manipulation from men they live with or depend on for money. LIPSTICK empowers them to say no to exploitation and yes to a brighter, safer future through educational workshops, leadership development and community organizing.
Women mobilized successfully to reduce drunk driving, they can do the same to reduce gun violence. Friends don&rsquo;t let friends buy guns illegally!
I hope you will join me and my special guests on Friday, November 22.
All the best,
