Dear
Friend,
Im working with Democrats and
Republicans to continue our focus on creating jobs and strengthening our
economy. Last week, the House passed several measures that will help put
Americans back to work and expand opportunities for small businesses in
our region.
Below is an overview of some of
the work Im doing on your behalf. To learn more about what I have been
working on, please visit
my
website ,

Sincerely,
Congressman Patrick
Meehan
Deepening the Delaware
River
Im proud to announce that a bipartisan infrastructure
bill passed by the House last week includes $35 million for the
continued deepening of the Delaware River shipping channel. Our regions ports
support thousands of jobs and contribute millions of dollars to our
local economy. Deepening the channel to 45 feet will ensure our ports
are able to accommodate newer and larger cargo vessels and remain
competitive with other seaports on the eastern seaboard. Ive long worked
closely with my friend Rep. Bob Brady (D-PA) from Philadelphia to
protect funding for this
project .
Focusing on Jobs
The Houses
focus on growing our economy continued last week with the passage of two
important measures that will strengthen our workforce and give small
and medium-sized businesses more flexibility to expand. Congress
passed a bipartisan compromise agreement on legislation that reforms our
job training programs. The bill eliminates redundant and ineffective
programs and helps families access the training services that best fit
their needs. Its the kind of bipartisan cooperation we need more of in
Washington.
The House also passed legislation
that will make it easier for small businesses to invest in new
facilities and equipment by allowing them to immediately deduct half the
cost of the investments from their taxable income. Non-partisan estimates
say this measure will create 212,000 new jobs and add $182 billion to
our economy.
Passing Bipartisan
Legislation
The House also passed two pieces of Homeland
Security legislation that I introduced, both with unanimous
bipartisan approval. Im proud that I was able to work with both Republicans
and Democrats to craft two pieces of legislation both parties could
support. To read more about these bills , please click
