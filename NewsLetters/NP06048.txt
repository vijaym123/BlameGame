Wisdom of the District: Dealing with ISIS
In the last month the world witnessed the brutality of ISIS, a radical Islamic group.
President Obama recently launched a military campaign aimed at ISIS and other Islamic terror groups inside Syria and Iraq and has sent more than 1,000 military advisers to the region.
Several Arab countries have publicly supported this effort.
However, the President says that the U.S. military will not have a combat role.
What do you believe is the most appropriate course of action in response to the threat caused by ISIS?
( )
Whatever it takes.
ISIS is a serious threat to the United States and must be destroyed completely and as soon as possible, even if it means committing U.S. troops to combat, and even if the U.S. has to act alone militarily.
( )
We should try military action and intelligence from afar for a period to see if it works.
Maintain President Obamas current strategy of working with Arab allies to conduct airstrikes and surveillance in support of regional forces and local ground forces fighting ISIS.
( )
Measured restraint. Scale back on military action and wait until a coalition of powerful allies
beyond the Arab nations involved in the latest military campaign
commits to helping the United States defeat ISIS militarily.
( )
Stay out of it.

I have another answer.
