We Must Never Forget
Dear Friend,
Yesterday we shared a Memorial Day message from Congressman Rigell
on Facebook and wanted to be sure you saw it too.
***
On Memorial Day, all across America, in our nations smallest towns and largest cities
we come together with grateful hearts to honor and remember those who gave what President Lincoln called the full measure of devotion in defense of our freedom.
We pause, and rightfully so, to pay tribute to the fallen, remember those still missing, and to honor and embrace their families.
I recently had the honor of sitting down with my friends, Gary and Terri Campbell, Gold Star parents who lost their son Lance Corporal Kielin Dunn in Afghanistan on February 18th, 2010, fighting for our nation in Operation Enduring Freedom. He was just 19 years old.
I would like for you to hear directly from them. You can do so by clicking
