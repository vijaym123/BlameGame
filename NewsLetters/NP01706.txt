Partnering with Israel to
Detect and Defeat Terrorist
Tunnels
3/30/15
Congressman
Doug Lamborn has introduced H.R. 1649, The Partnering to Detect
and Defeat Tunnels Act. This legislation is designed to bring
high-level leadership and resources to address a problem facing America and
Israel.
"We must be able to
defend against illicit tunnels, whether on our southern border today
or against terrorist attacks in the future. The terrorist group Hamas
used tunnels against Israel to devastating effect; we have already seen
rebels using tunnels against the Syrian regime. Sadly we know that
terrorists are quick to learn, so it is likely only a matter of time
before we see a terrorist group attack a U.S. or allied facility with
tunnels.
Detecting and
defeating tunnels is not an easy task. That's why the government has already
established an interagency tunnel working group and I am hopeful that
my bill will aid in their efforts to protect ourselves and our
allies."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
