Dear Friend,
Summer is a great time for Hoosier families.
Kids and parents have
more free time to enjoy the great outdoors at our local parks,
campgrounds and picnic spots.
Many parents are looking for resources
about how to stay safe and healthy during summer break.
If this is
you, I am pleased to direct you to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) website on summer safety.
I am impressed by the amount of helpful
information available on the site, and thought you might also find it
useful.
There is no time like the present to learn the steps we can
take to keep our families safe this season.
In particular, I found the Beat the heat and sun
section of the site
helpful. We have all heard how important it is to stay safe in the
summer sun, but did you know that melanoma, the form of skin cancer
that kills the most people, is twice as common now as it was 30 years
ago?
The CDC offers an official, unbiased site with information on
recommended ways to beat the heat and stay safe in the summer sun.
I hope you and your family have a safe and happy summer.
It is an
honor to serve in Congress on behalf of Hoosier families like yours. As
your representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current
topics and issues affecting you and our community. Please let me know
areas you find especially interesting or where I can provide you with
additional information. I value your ideas and look forward to hearing
from you.
Your Friend,
Andr
Last weekend I had a great time visiting with local families who
stopped by Center Township's annual Funfest.

Dear

Summer

If
this

you,
I

you

website
on
summer
safety.
I

We

but
did
