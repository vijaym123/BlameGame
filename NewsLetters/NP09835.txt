Twenty-two Northern Mariana Islands students saw their congressional office at work this week, as part of the Close Up program of civic and historical education. Tinian High School, Dr. Rita Hocog Inos High School, Kagman High School, Marianas High School, Saipan Southern High School, Grace Christian Academy and Mount Carmel School were all represented. We discussed how Congress works, my job as their Representative, and a host of various local and national issues. After lunch, they were taken on a staff-led tour of the U.S. Capitol. Close Up students: Alvin Arcega, Maria Dizon, Aurora David, Nathally San Nicolas, Gun Woo Shim, Mikayla Lopez, Eloise Lopez, Mary Urena, Daa Miyng Jeung, Ella Mae Dela Cruz, Jurinah Navarro, Rhea Banados, Joseph Lifoifoi Jr., Karee Lu Matagolai, Malaina Kileleman, Christian Punzalan, Neri Jingco, Shania Mesngon, Carl Dimitri Reyes, Darsha Camacho, William Camacho, and Richard Aldan. The students were accompanied by chaperones Elvira Mesngon, Vincente King, Josepha Kaipat, and Donald Cohen. Thank you for visiting and enjoy the rest of your trip.
DHS proposes grace period for CW renewals
Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has proposed allowing Commonwealth-only (CW) foreign workers to stay in their jobs for up to 240 days while their renewal is being processed. Many employers and workers come to the congressional office for help in this situation. The employer has applied for renewal, but DHS has not issued approval. Then, the current CW permit expires, making it illegal for the CW employee to keep working. Employers in this predicament have to limp along short-staffed. CW employees have to try to hang on without any income. Providing a 240-day grace period seems to make sense; but we will have to review the exact language, when it is published for public comment in the Federal Register. As always the bottom-line is: how does this affect local workers who are looking for jobs? The proposed rule should be available soon at www.regulations.gov .

FY15 CJS Appropriations bill funds Byrne JAG and STOP grants, but zeroes out Juvenile grants
The House Appropriations Committee approved this week the fiscal year 2015 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill that supports various public safety programs in the Northern Mariana Islands such as the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant at $376 million, same level as fiscal year 2014, and the STOP Violence Against Women Grant program at $195 million, a $2 million increase from fiscal year 2014. The bill also provides $45 million, a $10.5 million decrease, for the Juvenile Justice Part B program and zeroes out funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant and the Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Incentive Grants. On the natural resources side, the Committee approved $62.5 million for Coastal Zone Management Grants, a decrease of $3.6 million from fiscal year 2014, and level funding of $26 million for Coral Reef Conservation Grants. Most of these programs are formula grants or provide a set aside for the Northern Mariana Islands. The next step is for the bill to be considered on the House floor for approval by the Committee of the Whole.

The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus hosted the 2014 Congressional Symposium for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of CAPACs founding by former Congressman and Cabinet Member Norman Mineta. To celebrate this historic milestone, the symposium reflected on the achievements of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community over the past two decades and highlighted the issues still critical to our communities today. L-R: Scott Peters (D-CA), Jerry McNerney (D-CA), Al Green (D-TX), CAPAC Chair Judy Chu (D-CA), Madeleine Bordallo (D-GU), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Charlie Rangel (D-NY), Bobby Scott (D-VA), and Chair Emeritus Michael Honda (D-CA).
Resolution remembers the fallen, honors those who serve
I have introduced H.Res.578 , designating the week of May 11-17 as National Police Week, as a way to honor officers from the Northern Mariana Islands and throughout our nation, who have been killed or injured in the line of duty, and to recognize those who currently serve America's communities. Thanks to all our fine men and women in blue.

Public Law 113-34, enacted last September, conveyed submerged lands to the Commonwealth government. But President Obama withheld transfer of the lands around Uracas, Maug, and Asuncion, which are surrounded by the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument,
until the CNMI and the federal government agree on a management plan. Ms. Robyn Thorson, Pacific Region Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Mr. Mike Tosatto, Pacific Region Administrator of the National Marine Fisheries Service, briefed me this week on their planned trip to meet with Commonwealth officials. I am encouraging both sides to get to work on an agreement and set a timeframe for completion.
Public input sought on endangered species listing
The public has an opportunity to learn and comment on the possible listing of seventeen species in the Northern Mariana Islands for protection under the Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will hold a meeting at the American Memorial Park Visitor Center on May 14 from 6 to 8 p.m. to explain the listing process. We hope that people will come to these meetings, share their knowledge, learn, or suggest ways to protect some of the rarest plants and animals in the Mariana Islands, said Loyal Mehrhoff, the Services field supervisor for the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office. Eight animal and nine plant species endemic to the Northern Marianas are under consideration for protection. To learn more go to http://www.fws.gov/pacificislands/.

Ms. Claudia Fajardo Kaercher (far right) visited her congressional office while in Washington for the Asian and Pacific American Heritage month festivities. Traveling from Arizona with Claudia were Ms. Germaine Quitugua and Ms. Merci Hernandez, both from Guam. It was a pleasure meeting all of you. Thank you for coming by and spending some time with us.
Climate change already impacting the NMI
Coastal erosion and decreasing freshwater supplies are among the impacts to the Northern Marianas and other Pacific islands, according to this weeks White House report on global warming. The Third National Climate Assessment
looked at how climate change is affecting every region of our country. Chapter 23 summarizes impacts in the Pacific: Rising sea level, caused by melting polar ice and the expansion of warmer ocean water, is increasing coastal flooding and erosion and decreasing freshwater supplies. The warmer oceans are leading to increased coral bleaching. And increased levels of carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere are making the ocean more acidic, which causes coral to decay and costs fish their feeding and breeding grounds. The periodic National Climate Assessment was mandated by Congress in 1990 and is available at http://www.globalchange.gov/. And for an assessment of local impact by the CNMI Climate Change Working Group go to http://www.climatecnmi.net/p/vulnerability-assessment.html.
