News from Representative John Delaney
June 12, 2014
Dear Friend,
For over 1,000 days now, Warren Weinstein, a Rockville native and
grandfather of two, has been held captive by Al-Qaeda. This week, I
spoke out in support of Warren and introduced legislation encouraging
the Administration to secure his safe return
. As a community in Maryland and as a
country, our stance should be clear: it's time to bring Warren home.
Over the past month, news of the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has
captured the nation's attention. These stories should remind us of
those Americans still being held prisoner abroad, including Warren
Weinstein, a 72-year-old development expert from Rockville, MD who was
captured in Pakistan in 2011. To his family, friends and community,
Warren is known as a caring grandfather and also for his compassionate
work overseas, from his service in the Peace Corps through his time
with USAID.
This week, I brought our fight for Warren to the floor of the House of
Representatives, encouraging the Administration to take decisive action
to secure Warren's release. On Tuesday, I spoke on the House floor
reminding my colleagues that many Americans continue to be held
overseas
, and that
returning Warren home must remain a top priority. I was proud to act as
a voice for Warren and for all Americans being held abroad.
On Wednesday, I introduced H.Con.Res. 101
, a bill
urging the Administration to work towards Warren's safe release. My
bill also asks that the return of all United States citizens held
captive abroad, regardless of their different circumstances, be made a
top priority.
As a Freshman Class President, I've also spoken out for other captive
Americans, including Alan Gross
, a Montgomery County resident
being held in Cuba. Today, we have a responsibility to remember all
Americans held overseas and to maintain a sense of determination in our
work to bring them home.
I will continue my work to remind the Administration and my colleagues
in the House that a member of our community is still in Al-Qaeda's
hands. I welcome your feedback
on this important issue.
Sincerely,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney

Dear
Friend,
For
over
1,000
days
now,
Warren
Weinstein,
a
Rockville
native
and
grandfather
of
two,
has
been
held
captive
by
Al-Qaeda.
This
week,
I
spoke
out
in
support
of
Warren
and
introduced
legislation
encouraging
the
Administration
to
secure
his
safe
return .
As
a
community
in
Maryland
and
as
a
country,
our
stance
should
be
clear:
it&#8217;s
time
to
bring
Warren
home.
Over
the
past
month,
news
of
the
release
of
Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl
has
captured
the
nation&#8217;s
attention.
These
stories
should
remind
us
of
those
Americans
still
being
held
prisoner
abroad,
including
Warren
Weinstein,
a
72-year-old
development
expert
from
Rockville,
MD
who
was
captured
in
Pakistan
in
2011.
To
his
family,
friends
and
community,
Warren
is
known
as
a
caring
grandfather
and
also
for
his
compassionate
work
overseas,
from
his
service
in
the
Peace
Corps
through
his
time
with
USAID.
This
week,
I
brought
our
fight
for
Warren
to
the
floor
of
the
House
of
Representatives,
encouraging
the
Administration
to
take
decisive
action
to
secure
Warren&#8217;s
release.
On
Tuesday,
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
reminding
my
colleagues
that
many
Americans
continue
to
be
held
overseas ,
and
that
returning
Warren
home
must
remain
a
top
priority.
I
was
proud
to
act
as
a
voice
for
Warren
and
for
all
Americans
being
held
abroad.
On
Wednesday,
I
introduced
H.Con.Res.
101 ,
a
bill
urging
the
Administration
to
work
towards
Warren&#8217;s
safe
release.
My
bill
also
asks
that
the
return
of
all
United
States
citizens
held
captive
abroad,
regardless
of
their
different
circumstances,
be
made
a
top
priority.
As
a
Freshman
Class
President,
I've

all
Americans
held
overseas
and
to
maintain
a

of

in
our
work
to
bring
them
home.
I
will
continue
my
work
to
remind
the
Administration
and
my
colleagues
in
the
House
that
a
member
of
our
community
is
still
in
Al-Qaeda&#8217;s
hands.
I
welcome
your
feedback
on
this
important
issue.
