Wicker Gives Thanks for America's Enduring
Freedom
Threats to Liberty Remain in Eastern
Europe, Iraq
One of the
greatest blessings to remember this Thanksgiving is the gift of
freedom, which brave Americans have fought for throughout our history.
This year is an especially meaningful time to celebrate the enduring
strength of liberty in America.
Two hundred years ago, Francis
Scott Key penned the patriotic poem that would later become the lyrics
to our national anthem.
Defending the Land of the
Free
Often overlooked in U.S.
history, the War of 1812 proved the might of a young America, which was
once again engaged in war with Great Britain.
On the morning of
September 14, 1814, Francis Scott Key saw the U.S. flag raised above
Fort McHenry in Baltimore after a prolonged attack by the British.
He wrote the question, "Does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er
the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
American forces
had prevailed through the night amid "the rockets' red glare," but
the victory was hardly a guarantee of lasting freedom.
With this
question, our "Star-Spangled Banner" challenges each generation to
defend and protect the land of the free.
We are eternally grateful
for the service members and their families who have responded to this
call.
Remembering Vaclav
Havel
We should be proud that America's legacy of
freedom has become an example for countries around the world.
One of
the greatest defenders of democracy was Vaclav Havel, an outspoken
critic of communist rule in Czechoslovakia.
During the Cold War,
his message of hope, broadcast by uncensored outlets like Radio Free
Europe and Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), gave people under oppressive regimes
the belief that they could demand change.
Today, RFE/RL
broadcasts in 21 countries where a free press is still banned or
compromised.
Earlier this month, I was part of
an important tribute commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Velvet
Revolution, when Czechs and Slovaks peacefully overthrew the
communist government.
I was honored with the Vaclav Havel Defender of
Freedom Award for my longtime support of a free press, including the
continued broadcast of RFE/RL in the Balkans and
Iraq.
The award was presented to me by former
secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who fled Czechoslovakia with her
family as a child.
It celebrates the inspiring legacy of Vaclav
Havel as a playwright, activist, and first president of the Czech
Republic.
On November 19, he became the fourth international leader to
be honored with a bust in the U.S. Capitol's Freedom
Foyer.
Freedom's Current
Challenges
Despite the progress that has been made since the end of the Cold
War, freedom is still threatened in many places of the world, from
Ukraine to Hong Kong.
Particularly heartbreaking is the religious
persecution escalating in the Middle East.
Americans were
horrified to learn earlier this year that the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) was ruthlessly targeting Christians and other religious
minorities for their faith.
In an attempt to establish a
7th-century-style Islamic caliphate, ISIS has forced thousands of Christians to
flee, convert, or be killed.
I am
hopeful the pursuit of freedom will overcome these challenges and that
the will of the people can be heard.
As President Ronald Reagan
reminded us, "Freedom is never more than one generation away from
extinction.
We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream.
It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the
same."
