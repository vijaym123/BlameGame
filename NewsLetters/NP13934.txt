I wanted to keep you updated on the status of the farm bill.
Members of both the House and Senate
called a conference committee
were selected by their respective leadership to negotiate the differences between the farm bills passed in each chamber.
The conference committee has been meeting since October, and I am hopeful that they will reach an agreement quickly on reauthorization of the farm bill.
I have included a
report
detailing the differences between the bills passed in the House and Senate, some of which include:
The Senate passed one bill, while the House passed two separate bills (one on the agriculture provisions and one on the nutrition provisions);
Both the House and Senate bills reauthorize the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (the Senates reauthorization is for five years and the Houses is for three years); and
Both bills increase funding for crop insurance ($5 billion in the Senate bill and $8.9 billion in the House bill)
I would encourage you to read the full report to stay up-to-date on the latest versions of the bill.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - I will
continue
working for our nations farmers and remain committed to supporting agricultural producers.
