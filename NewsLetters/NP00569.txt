Friend,
Our deadline is in just 3 days and we are making progress towards our goal.
And yesterday, we received some exciting news-- a group of our supporters will match all donations up to $5,000 before Sunday.
Will you pitch in $5, $25 or whatever you can before our Sunday deadline and have your contribution doubled?
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate: $5
Donate: $25
Donate: $50
Donate: $100
Donate: $250
Donate: Other amount
This incredibly generous offer will open up so many new doors for us as we make budget decisions for 2016,
but first, we have to unlock the match and hit $5,000 before Sunday.
We are close to having a huge month and every dollar we raise now will move us one step closer to winning in 2016&mdash; click here to chip in.
Be well,
Ami
P.S. We&rsquo;ve been updating our finance plan today&mdash;we&rsquo;ll keep you posted on what we come up with.
