Rep. Miller Presents Medals to Family of Late WWII Veteran Clifford Greenslade
Harrison Township, MI
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) presented
World War II medals to the family of the late War veteran Clifford Greenslade in honor of his service to our nation.
&#8220;The attack on Pearl Harbor awakened this nation &#8211; a sleeping giant &#8211; with a reaffirmed, absolute commitment to victory, &#8221;
Miller noted during the presentation.
&#8220; Clifford Greenslade, who served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during the War, was committed to
defending the freedoms and liberties that we hold dear. I am Proud to present these medals, on behalf of a grateful nation, so bravely earned by a member of America&#8217;s greatest generation.&#8221;
The former Mr. Clifford Greenslade
(1918-1981) of Detroit proudly served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during WWII. During the War, Clifford was stationed in various locations including the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. After
the War, he returned to Michigan and worked at the Mayberry Sanitarium Hospital in Northville before being transferred to Herman Kiefer Hospital in Detroit during the 1967 riots, which was the headquarters for the 101 st
Airborne Division. Clifford
is survived by three sons, Reginald, Eric and David, and eight grandchildren.
Mr. Greenslade&#8217;s family was presented with the following service awards:
Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 2 bronze service stars and 1 silver service star, World War
II Victory Medal, and the WWII Honorable Lapel Button.
Mr. Greenslade&#8217;s family contacted Rep. Miller&#8217;s office to help advocate on their behalf to obtain the appropriate military medals recognizing his service.
