Securing Our Border - Calling on the President to Act
I'm proud America has an honorable history built on legal immigration.
But today we have a clear problem with illegal immigration.
Over
47,000 minors have illegally crossed the border into the U.S. in just
the past 5 months.
This number is up 815% from 2011.
And according to
the Obama Administration, the problem will just keep growing
.
This surge in illegal
activity isn't a coincidence.
It's the direct result of the
Administration's failure to enforce our immigration laws.
They've
insisted our border is secure - but if even children can find the
holes, are we really protected against drugs, criminals, disease, and
worse?
In Texas, we're seeing the effects of this border breach every day.
We're owed an explanation of exactly how the Administration is working
to address the growing risk in our backyard.
Last Friday, I sent a
letter to the White House
with my fellow Texan Reps. Conaway
and Thornberry, our neighbors to the north and south, urging the
Administration to address the influx of illegal immigrants into Texas.
Communities throughout Texas deserve a safe and secure border.
I hope
the Administration will begin to work with Congress to enforce the laws
on the books, and to secure our border once and for all.
Evidence of IRS' Lois Lerner Abusing Power Lost?
It's been over a year since we found out about IRS discrimination
against groups that don't share their political views, and I'm still
outraged at the Administration's abuse of power.
We've been doing
everything we can
in the House to get to the
bottom of this and restore fairness in our nation's tax system.
But as
you've probably heard, IRS officials aren't doing their part to comply.
They claim that because of a computer crash, the exact emails we need
to prove Lois Lerner's involvement in targeting conservative groups
have been lost.
But that doesn't add up.
Laws require all federal
agencies
to back up their emails.
And the IRS had a contract with a
file-storage company
for this very purpose.
So
why won't they turn over Lerner's emails?
And would the IRS allow us
taxpayers to use the same 'my dog ate my homework' excuse when tax
season rolls around?
I doubt it.
We're taking an aggressive approach to sort out the facts.
The House
is pressing
for interviews, briefings, and a Department of Justice
investigation.
The Oversight Committee will hold hearings tonight and
tomorrow to gather more information. Unfortunately, this is the
beginning of yet another investigation into foul play at the IRS.
We'll
continue to hold the Administration accountable, at the IRS and across
the federal government.
Action Item: Reducing Regulatory Burden on Farmers and Ranchers
To plan ahead in the uncertain world of farming and ranching, many rely
on the futures and commodities markets to protect against risk
associated with their business.
But Washington keeps making it harder
and harder for farmers and ranchers to get by.
This week, the House is
expected to vote on a bill to reauthorize and improve the Commodity
Future Trading Commission (CFTC).
The Customer Protection and End-User
Relief Act
will
reform the CFTC to make it more accountable to you.
It will give our
farmers and ranchers the freedom to hedge against risk, grow their
business, and create more jobs. I look forward to supporting this bill
when it comes up for a vote this week.

Securing
Our
Border
&#8211;
Calling
on
the
President
to
Act
I&#8217;m
proud
America
has
an
honorable
history
built
on
legal
immigration.
But
today
we
have
a
clear
problem
with
illegal
immigration.
Over
47,000
minors
have
illegally
crossed
the
border
into
the
U.S.
in
just
the
past
5
months.
This
number
is
up
815%
from
2011.
And
according
to
the
Obama
Administration,
the
problem
will
just
keep
growing .
This
surge
in
illegal
activity
isn&#8217;t
a
coincidence.
It&#8217;s
the
direct
result
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
failure
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws.
They&#8217;ve
insisted
our
border
is
secure
&#8211;
but
if
even
children
can
find
the
holes,
are
we
really
protected
against
drugs,
criminals,
disease,
and
worse?
In
Texas,
we&#8217;re
seeing
the
effects
of
this
border
breach
every
day.
We&#8217;re
owed
an
explanation
of
exactly
how
the
Administration
is
working
to
address
the
growing
risk
in
our
backyard.
Last
Friday,
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
White
House
with
my
fellow
Texan
Reps.
Conaway
and
Thornberry,
our
neighbors
to
the
north
and
south,
urging
the
Administration
to
address
the
influx
of
illegal
immigrants
into
Texas.
Communities
throughout
Texas
deserve
a
safe
and
secure
border.
I
hope
the
Administration
will
begin
to
work
with
Congress
to
enforce
the
laws
on
the
books,
and
to
secure
our
border
once
and
for
all.
Evidence
of
IRS&#8217;
Lois
Lerner
Abusing
Power
Lost? It&#8217;s
been
over
a
year
since
we
found
out
about
IRS
discrimination
against
groups
that
don&#8217;t
share
their
political
views,
and
I&#8217;m
still
outraged
at
the
Administration&#8217;s
abuse
of
power.
We&#8217;ve
been
doing
everything
we
can
in
the
House
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
and
restore
fairness
in
our
nation&#8217;s
tax
system.
But
as
you&#8217;ve
probably
heard,
IRS
officials
aren&#8217;t
doing
their
part
to
comply.
They
claim
that
because
of
a
computer
crash,
the
exact
emails
we
need
to
prove
Lois
Lerner&#8217;s
involvement
in
targeting
conservative
groups
have
been
lost.
But
that
doesn&#8217;t
add
up.
Laws
require
all
federal
agencies
to
back
up
their
emails.
And
the
IRS
had
a
contract
with
a
file-storage
company
for
this
very
purpose.
So
why
won&#8217;t
they
turn
over
Lerner&#8217;s
emails?
And
would
the
IRS
allow
us
taxpayers
to
use
the
same
&#8216;my
dog
ate
my
homework&#8217;
excuse
when
tax
season
rolls
around?
I
doubt
it.
We&#8217;re
taking
an
aggressive
approach
to
sort
out
the
facts.
The
House
is
pressing
for
interviews,
briefings,
and
a
Department
of
Justice
investigation.
The
Oversight
Committee
will
hold
hearings
tonight
and
tomorrow
to
gather
more
information.
Unfortunately,
this
is
the
beginning
of
yet
another
investigation
into
foul
play
at
the
IRS.
We&#8217;ll
continue
to
hold
the
Administration
accountable,
at
the
IRS
and
across
the
federal
government.
Action
Item:
Reducing
Regulatory
Burden
on
Farmers
and
Ranchers
To
plan
ahead
in
the
uncertain
world
of
farming
and
ranching,
many
rely
on
the
futures
and
commodities
markets
to
protect
against
risk
associated
with
their
business.
But
Washington
keeps
making
it
harder
and
harder
for
farmers
and
ranchers
to
get
by.
This
week,
the
House
is
expected
to
vote
on
a
bill
to
reauthorize
and
improve
the
Commodity
Future
Trading
Commission
(CFTC).
The
Customer
Protection
and
End-User
Relief
Act
will
reform
the
CFTC
to
make
it
more
accountable
to
you.
It
will
give
our
farmers
and
ranchers
the
freedom
to
hedge
against
risk,
grow
their
business,
and
create
more
jobs.
I
look
forward
to
supporting
this
bill
when
it
comes
up
for
a
vote
this
week.
