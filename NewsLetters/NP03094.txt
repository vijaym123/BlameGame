The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Each year since you elected me to Congress, I have rolled back my salary to the 2008 level. Last Monday, I once again hand delivered a personal check to the U.S. Treasury to help pay down our massive federal debt. If we are serious about fixing whats broken in Washington, then we must first get our own house in order. It starts with us. Real leadership is leading by example.
_____________ ______________________
On Thursday, I stopped in four locations throughout my Central Florida district to present a ceremonial check representing the significant savings from my office budget. For the fourth year in a row, I have cut wasteful spending and saved over 30% of the taxpayer dollars allotted to run my Congressional office. You can
see my full statement here.
This year, my office savings amounted to $382,391.83, bringing the cumulative sum for the past four years to a grand total of $1,638,580.18. Many of the changes and reforms I have implemented include simple business practices, yet these efforts represent what could happen if every government agency began simply looking for ways to cut waste.

The United States Military Academy notified me this week that two of the young people from our community which I had extended a congressional nomination for a service academy had been accepted by West Point. It was a great privilege to go to Olympia High School on Friday and officially inform Soumya Sreerama and her parents that her nomination had been accepted.
Later, at Dr. Phillips High School, Principal Suzanne Knight, teachers, counselors, coaches, and family members joined me in surprising Pierre Groenewald with his Congressional appointment to the United States Military Academy.

As a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I was honored that Chairman Shuster picked me to join the influential Subcommittee on Highways and Transit ahead of the much anticipated surface transportation reauthorization bill. Transportation is critical to our economy and job creation in Central Florida, and I will continue to work towards improving our transportation infrastructure while ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Winter Haven contacted my office regarding a reimbursement for medical care he had received outside of the VA system. Although the constituent had been awarded a medical settlement from the Board of Veteran Appeals and was eligible, he was still waiting for the reimbursement.
My office submitted a Congressional Inquiry on the constituents behalf, and were finally directed to the correct department. Shortly afterward, the constituent received his reimbursement and a letter of apology for the erroneous delay.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
During his State of the Union address, President Obama floated a proposal to mandate "free" community college for all. As details emerged, however, it was discovered that he planned to pay for his proposal by taxing a popular middle class college savings plan commonly known as 529 plans or 529 college funds. These tax free accounts are often opened soon after the birth of a child and allow parents to save money tax free over the years in preparation for our children's future, potential college expenses.
Should your efforts to responsibly save for your student's future be taxed to pay for more government programs?

Legislative Update:
Last week, I introduced H.R. 579, the
To Help Reduce Inefficient Government Tendencies (THRIFT) Act of 2015.
If enacted, this bill would provide an incentive to federal departments and agencies that evaluate their own spending and identify measures that reduce costs and improve efficiency.
If every area of the federal government began intentionally cutting waste, we could get a lot closer to balancing our budget and trimming the massive burden of debt that will be inherited by our children and grandchildren.

THRIFT Act of 2015 , here is a
