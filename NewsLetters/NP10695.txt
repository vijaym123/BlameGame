HOLDING LOIS LERNER IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS
When former IRS official Lois Lerner appeared before the House
Oversight Committee on May 22, 2013, she voluntarily gave an opening
statement and, as a result, waved her Fifth Amendment rights. Ms.
Lerner continues to refuse to answer the Committee's questions and
comply with a duly issued subpoena. Therefore, the Oversight Committee
had no option but to move forward on a contempt proceedings.
Watch here
and here
for my thoughts on the contempt charges.
KEEP CATTLE IN NEVADA
I joined four of my colleagues from the Utah delegation in sending a
letter to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) director regarding cattle
seized in Nevada. The letter
reads:
"We strongly support Governor Herbert and echo his concerns, expressed
in his April 2nd letter to you, that going forward with the plan to
transport the Nevada cattle to Utah may endanger the health of Utah
herds and place Utah state employees and other Utah residents in
danger. "

HOW ARE TAXPAYER DOLLARS BEING SPENT IN AFGHANISTAN?
Since 2002, the U.S. has directed $102 billion towards relief and
reconstruction in one of the most corrupt countries on the planet -
Afghanistan. The House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security, of
which I am chairman, recently held a hearing
that continued to
examine how the government is overseeing the billions of dollars being
spent.

ONGOING INVESTIGATION
When Attorney General Eric Holder came before the House Judiciary
Committee last week, I used my time to ask him
a series of questions regarding the investigation into former CIA
director, Gen. Petraeus - particularly why it remains open after two
years? Mr. Holder offered no answers, only saying that it is still an
"ongoing investigation," and he was "not in a position to say much more
about it."
