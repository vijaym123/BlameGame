A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
June 22, 2014
Dear friends,
There was a lot of headline making news in the House of Representatives
this week: from the IRS "losing" Lois Lerner's emails, to House
Republicans electing a new Majority Leader (Kevin McCarthy from
California) and Majority Whip (Steve Scalise from Louisiana). There
were also other newsworthy items that happened this week, on topics
about which many of you have reached out to me to discuss. Keep reading
for a wrap-up of the week that was.
Was Sgt. Bergdahl exchange worth it?
We heard captivating and at times
heartbreaking testimony from a soldier who served with Sgt. Bowe
Bergdahl and from the father of a soldier who gave his life while
searching for Sgt. Bergdahl. This is no doubt a complex situation, of
which clear-cut answers are not always easy to come by, but there is
little doubt that the testimony these gentlemen offered left us all
with heavy hearts and much more information to consider. Click on the
image below to watch my exchange from this week's hearing:
The Light Will Still Shine: My legislation to preserve and protect both
the day-to-day functions and history of the Ashland Breakwater Light
unanimously passed the House Natural Resources Committee this week. It
now has a clear path to come the House Floor for a vote.
In 2012, the Coast Guard announced its intent to give-up ownership of
the
Lighthouse. H.R. 4049 will
facilitate the transfer of responsibility for the iconic structure from
the Coast Guard to the National Park Service preserving it for public
education and access.
Next year will mark the 100th Anniversary of the Ashland Breakwater
Light, a lighthouse that has stood strong on Lake Superior's shores,
guiding ships through dark nights and storms and welcoming travelers
back home. I am grateful to the Natural Resources Committee for
considering the bill and to everyone in Wisconsin for your continued
support of this legislation and the lighthouse. I will continue to keep
you posted on its progress. For more information, click here

Wisconsinites in D.C.: One of the great privileges of working in the
"People's House" is the opportunity to show it to constituents during
their visits to D.C. Below are a few pictures from a visit with several
7th District families. I took the kids to the Floor to help me vote,
and then we all enjoyed an historic view of the city from the Speaker's
balcony. If you are planning a visit to our nation's capital, please
call my Washington D.C. office, (202) 225-3365; we would be happy to
help make it a more memorable trip.
That is a wrap-up of this week. Thank you for the continued privilege
of representing Wisconsin's 7th District. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean

Dear
friends,
There
was
a
lot
of
headline
making
news
in
the
House
of
Representatives
this
week:
from
the
IRS
&#8220;losing&#8221;
Lois
Lerner&#8217;s
emails,
to
House
Republicans
electing
a
new
Majority
Leader
(Kevin
McCarthy
from
California)
and
Majority
Whip
(Steve
Scalise
from
Louisiana).
There
were
also
other
newsworthy
items
that
happened
this
week,
on
topics
about
which
many
of
you
have
reached
out
to
me
to
discuss.
Keep

a

that
was&#8230;
Was
Sgt.

worth
it?
We
heard
captivating
and
at
times
heartbreaking
testimony
from
a

who

Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl
and
from
the
father

Sgt.
Bergdahl.
This
is
no

a
complex

of
which
clear-cut
answers
are
not
always
easy
to
come
by,
but
there
is
little

that
the

these

offered
left
us
all
with
heavy
hearts
and
