Repealing the SGR
Formula
Last week the House passed a historic bill to end the Sustainable
Growth Rate (SGR) formula, also known as the "doc fix." This is one of
the first positive entitlement reforms we've seen in a decade, and is
an important step forward in strengthening Medicare, improving health
care for our seniors, and saving taxpayer's
dollars.
The SGR formula was
created in 1997 when Congress attempted to cap Medicare costs by making
annual reductions to Medicare provider payments. Since that time,
Congress has intervened seventeen times to prevent these physician cuts
from going into effect. The price of putting off a permanent fix has
cost the taxpayers close to $170 billion, and has
simply masked the insolvency of
Medicare. These looming cuts have also served as a continuous threat to
physicians and their ability to see and treat Medicare
recipients.
The
legislation we passed would do away with this flawed formula, while also
putting forward patient-centered reforms, which would reward doctors for
quality, not quantity of care. Furthermore, according to the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), our legislation to repeal the
SGR would generate $900 million in savings for taxpayers over the next
decade, as opposed to continuing to implement the temporary "doc fix"
patches that Congress has been passing since
2003.
While I was disappointed
that provisions to repeal the medical device tax were not included in
the final bill, this legislation is a big win for the American people,
and I was pleased to support its passage. This bill currently awaits
consideration by the U.S. Senate.

A Balanced
Budget for a Stronger
America
Every day, American families across the
country make tough decisions to keep their own budgets balanced and
ensure they live within their means. Last week, House Republicans led
efforts to ensure Washington does the same. The House passed, with my
support, the House GOP Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Resolution,
A Balanced
Budget for a Stronger America.
The House GOP budget seeks to tackle our nation's
debt problem by cutting $5.5 trillion in federal spending and
balancing our budget in less than ten years. It also repeals Obamacare in
full, including the law's onerous taxes, mandates, and regulations. This
balanced budget is a positive step forward for our nation - it seeks to
address our nation's debt crisis while also supporting the programs
that are critical to our national and economic
security.
