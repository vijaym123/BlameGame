Stop Human Trafficking
Earlier this month, the House and Senate presented the President with
the
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015
(S. 178), bipartisan legislation which takes steps to address the serious human rights concerns of human trafficking. This legislation:
Imposes a $5,000 fine on convicted sex offenders, human smugglers, and human traffickers.
Uses fines collected from offenders to finance programs designed for victims of human trafficking.
Improves current training programs on human trafficking for law enforcement agencies.
Strengthens law enforcement's ability to identify and prosecute human trafficking offenses.
I was proud to support this legislation to put an end to modern-day slavery.

Recently, the House of Representatives passed my legislation, the
Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act (H.R. 474) , to better assist America's homeless veterans. This legislation ensures that veterans who are homeless, as well as those transitioning out of incarceration, are eligible for various services provided by the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program, including job training services, housing assistance, and substance abuse counseling.

2nd District Spotlight: Control Bionics
A local business right here in Ohio's Second District is developing life-changing, innovative technology to assist severely-disabled individuals, including some of our nation's veterans.
Last Thursday, I visited Control Bionics to learn more about the
NeuroSwitch , a device that harnesses the brain's electrical signals to enable individuals to communicate through computers.

An Overreaching EPA
This new rule would give the EPA unprecedented power.
Last week, the EPA released a new Waters of the United States rule, which would give the agency the power to regulate millions of acres of land across the United States. This new rule gives the EPA unprecedented power to police even the smallest areas with connections to navigable waters, like ditches and puddles. This is yet another example of the EPA and this administration's out-of-control bureaucracy.
Earlier this month, I supported
H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015 , which would have rejected this EPA ruling before it could take effect. H.R. 1732 passed the House, but the Senate failed to consider it. As your representative, I will continue the fight in Congress to rein in the EPA.
A Tribute to America's Fallen Heroes
Last week we celebrated Memorial Day, a day dedicated to the memory of those who gave the last full measure of devotion to defend the way of life we hold so dear. They paid the ultimate price so that the Star Spangled Banner continues to wave over the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.
On behalf of an ever-grateful nation, I thank these heroes and their families. May God bless them and the United States of America.
