7th DISTRICT
December 17, 2014
Dear
Friend,
As we begin
the 114th Congress in January, I wanted to inform you of my recent
selection as the Chairman of a new oversight and investigative
subcommittee.
In this new leadership position under the House Oversight
and Government Committee, I will chair the Transportation and Public
Assets panel. My jurisdiction will include oversight and investigation
of the transportation, TSA, GSA, HUD and FEMA.

My
investigations and oversight responsibility will be directed to areas in
which I have previously focused, including the review of operations and
administration for all modes of transportation. In addition, this new
subcommittee will examine idle public assets and agency waste at the
General Services Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency and
Housing and Urban Development.
In the 114 th
Congress, we will launch a full court press to ensure that the federal
government is not wasting taxpayers resources in any of these important
government programs.
Some of my previous leadership positions
include Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Chairman of
the House Aviation Subcommitteel; of the Government Operations
Subcommittee; of the House Civil Service Subcommittee and of the House Criminal
Justice Drug Policy Subcommittee.
I have made it a top
priority to go after idle federal assets, including publishing a report in
2012 entitled, Sitting on Our Assets: The Federal Governments Misuse
of Taxpayer-Owned Assets. The report highlighted billions of dollars
in federal waste and disclosed significant quantities of idle federal
assets.
Some of my most recent investigative work
includes:
Lead an investigation into wasteful conference spending
that resulted in criminal referrals, convictions and hundreds of
millions of dollars in reduced conference spending
Conducted
successful reform efforts on underutilized federal assets,
Transportation Security Administration and Amtrak
Chaired multiple
hearings investigating billions of dollars in duplicative waste in
Federal IT spending
Successfully tackled wasteful
conference spending, saving taxpayers nearly half a billion dollars in two
years
In the 114th Congress, I will continue to serve, not only
as the senior member of the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee, but also as the former Chairman and as a senior member of the
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
As the year
and the113th Congress come to a close,
I would like to wish you
and your family a Happy Holidays.
With my regards and best
wishes, I remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
Member
of Congress
