A Message from Congressman Paul Broun
Should IRS Employees Receive Bonuses?
This week the
Internal Revenue Service
announced
that it has reinstated employee bonuses for fiscal 2013.
That means an estimated $62.5 million of taxpayers hard-earned cash will go towards performance awards for IRS employees. After last year's scandal regarding the IRS's targeting of conservative groups, I believe that the organization needs to answer for any wrongdoings or illegal activity before doling out any bonuses. What do you think?

Broun Invites Georgian Affected by Obamacare &amp; IRS Targeting to State of the Union
" Like many Americans, Debbie wants answers from the President, and it is my hope that the President addresses these issues tonight and gives the American people the apology and explanation that they deserve.
Broun: Farm Bill Conference Report a Complete Disgrace
"The Farm bill brought before the House today is a complete disgrace. This bill fails to make any real reforms, re-joins the food stamp and farm programs which had been separated in the House bill, and somehow manages to exceed the spending levels of both chambers passed versions of this bill."
