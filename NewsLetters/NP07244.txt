The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
During the last few weeks of schools summer break, it has been a pleasure to welcome so many constituent groups, families, and individuals from the community to the Capitol. Last week, Eugene Dernbach and Nancy Christman from Dr. Phillips dropped by my office, and I was able to snap a picture with Adam Weinstein and his son, Robert, from Orlando. Last Friday, it was also great to spend some time with David Norris and two of his sons who live in Tavares.
Concerned citizens also visited who were representing an issue or cause that was of importance to them, including Kurt and Sybil Thompson representing the Professional Landscape Network, and others with the National Council of Chain Restaurants and Florida Bankers Association. It is always helpful to hear directly from business leaders who can explain firsthand the federal obstacles job creators are facing.

The Town of Oakland proclaimed last Saturday as Adrian Cowan Day, and celebrated the young mans dedication to serving his local community. While attending West Orange High School, Adrian held the record for the most points and most shots in one basketball game. Recently, Adrian founded AC Basketball Camp, and it was my pleasure to join Pat Burke and the Town of Oakland in recognizing the impact that Adrian Cowan has had in the community.

Last week, the House unanimously
passed a resolution
which calls on the international community to recognize Hamass terrorist actions and support Israels sovereign right to defend its territory and stop the rocket attacks on its citizens. The House also passed an emergency appropriations measure that provides immediate funding for the State of Israels Iron Dome defense system.
This assistance is needed to replenish stocks of interceptors used in protecting Israel from Hamas rocket attacks.
This is an important resolution and I am proud to stand with Israel.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
During the summer travel season, several constituents have contacted my office with questions or requests for assistance with renewing their passports. Recently, a constituent from Winter Garden called seeking assistance on expediting her passport application in order to travel with her husband because of his health needs. My office was able to coordinate with the Miami Passport Agency to ensure that she had an appointment and would receive her passport as quickly as possible.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

The
previous survey question,
"Do you believe the House of Representatives should defend its Constitutional responsibilities and the separation of powers by asking the federal courts to rule against President Obama for an overreach of his authority?"
Legislative Update:
Last week, I voted in favor of a resolution that authorized the Speaker to enter into litigation against the President for not respecting the constitutional separation of powers put in place by our Founders. This separation of powers was meant to defend liberty from the overreach of a zealous Executive Branch. However, this action is bigger than this President or this Speaker.
I took no joy in casting this vote, but in bypassing the American peoples elected legislative representatives, the President undermines the very Constitution he is sworn to uphold.
