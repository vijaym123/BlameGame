Republicans are spending $3.2 MILLION against Ami this week. To fight back, a group of Ami&rsquo;s supporters has agreed to MATCH ALL GIFTS.
## MIDNIGHT DEADLINE
##
Look, we&#39;re in the fight of our lives:
-- Republicans are spending $3.2 MILLION to defeat Ami at the last minute
-- Doug Ose himself loaned another $1 MILLION to his campaign to buy this election
--
And every piece of data says this race could go either way
More importantly:
Our FINAL ad buy deadline is tonight at midnight. We thought we were fine, but we just found out that we&rsquo;re coming up around $3,OOO short.
Listen, I know that&rsquo;s a flood of bad news. But here&rsquo;s some good news:
Any gift to Ami&rsquo;s campaign before midnight will be matched dollar-for-dollar!
There are just FOUR days left. The outcome of this race is at stake.
So please, whether you&rsquo;ve chipped in five times or haven&rsquo;t chipped in yet, we need your urgent support.
