In October, focus turns to bringing awareness to diseases like breast cancer and lupus.
I believe we must bring more than just awareness, we must prioritize medical research and find new ways to treat diseases.
Thats why I introduced legislation to find cures for diseases like heart disease, Alzheimers, and diabetes. The Patients First Act ( H.R. 1740 ) would intensify research and human clinical trials using stem cells that are ethically obtained and that show evidence of providing near-term clinical benefit for human patients.
With the research community on the verge of numerous medical advancements, it is imperative that we direct taxpayer dollars to medical research that will provide the most benefit to patients in the shortest amount of time.
I strongly believe that the federal government should do all it can to encourage the forms of medical research that show the most promise for curing and treating patients so we can combat these diseases.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - I also introduced the Independent Innovator and Repurposing Act,
H.R.4287 , which seeks to encourage the development of new medical treatments, by repurposing existing drugs to address new ailments, conditions, or diseases like epilepsy, cancer, and post-traumatic stress.
