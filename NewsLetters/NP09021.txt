Friend,
Late yesterday evening, a supporter told me the following:
&quot;A fellow Bera for Congress supporter just told me how excited she was by the matching program - she gave $100 and it turned into $200!
I know you&#39;re fighting to break through the gridlock in Washington, so this morning, my husband and I started talking and decided we&#39;re willing to invest the maximum amount for the primary - and match the contributions dollar for dollar up to $5000. Can you let the other supporters know?&quot;
I don&#39;t know what to say.
So far, our grassroots t eam has chipped in over $10,000 -- which turns into $20,000 with the matching program.
Now, we&#39;ve had this generous couple offer to extend the match another $5,000.
Can you click here to give $5 right now? If we can hit $15,000 (you can check out our progress here), that means $30,000 total for our campaign .
I know we can do this.
This dollar for dollar match means that your $5 becomes $10-- and your $25 turns into $50.
This is the largest donor match we&#39;ve ever done. Let&#39;s take full advantage of this opportunity.
I am humbled by how terrific this final pre-primary fundraising push has gone.
If we can hit this new goal -- $15,000 by
midnight tomorrow -- we will have shattered our online fundraising record.
We&#39;re already at $10,557 -- only a bit more to go.
If you can, give $5 before
midnight on June 3rd .
It means a lot.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
