Dear Fellow Nevadan,
More than 260,000
brave Filipino veterans made a great sacrifice and answered Americas
call to serve in World War II. These veterans were offered U.S.
citizenship in recognition of their service, but this hard-earned benefit did
not extend to their children. Thousands of families have been separated
for decades because of this injustice. No service member should be
prevented from reuniting with their families because of our antiquated
immigration system. It is time we properly thank these patriots for
their service.
Last week, I introduced the Filipino Veterans
Family Reunification Act with Senator Mazie Hirono to right that wrong
and provide for the reunification of aging Filipino WWII veterans and
their families. Currently, veterans must file for a family visa to be
reunited with their children in the United States. Because of our
antiquated immigration system, it can take more than 20 years for these
applications to be reviewed. The Filipino Veterans Family Reunification
Act exempts these veterans children, about 20,000 individuals in all,
from the numerical limitation on immigrant visas. This legislation
would ensure these brave veterans know how thankful we are for their
noble service.
I am proud to represent more than 100,000
Filipino-Americans in Nevada, and I know their contributions have
strengthened our great country. In 2009, I fought to pass legislation that
provided long-overdue recognition and repatriation for Filipino veterans
who served under the American flag during World War II. After reports
by Filipino veterans and their families about concerns they had with
the Department of Veterans Affairs, I urged President Obama to ensure
that these veterans received the a comprehensive and fair review
compensation of benefit eligibility that they deserve.
The
Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act is a common sense step forward. I
thank my colleagues Senators Hirono, Murkowski, Boxer, and Schatz for
their bipartisan support of this legislation. I look forward to future
cooperation with my colleagues to keep families together in Nevada
and throughout the country.
