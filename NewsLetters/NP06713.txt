. That's why I'm introducing a bipartisan bill called the "Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act of 2014" in September to reform the program before America's main streets and civilian police militarize any further.
The program currently lacks meaningful oversight and accountability. We need an honest debate on the type of surplus military-grade weaponry that is appropriate for transfer from war zones to our streets.
My legislation will ban the free transfer of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs), other armored personnel carriers, armored drones, assault weapons greater than .50 caliber, silencers and certain aircraft. The legislation will also ensure that the DOD undertakes an annual accounting of what's been transferred, by whom and to whom, to prevent military items from being auctioned on eBay or sold to the highest bidder.

VOTING RIGHTS ACT AMENDEMENT: This month, we marked the 49th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Although the Supreme Court took a step backwards last year by holding that the formula in Section 4 of the Act was unconstitutional and could no longer be used, I remain hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can come together to fix this mistake and pass the Voting Rights Act Amendment.
[cid:image013.jpg@01CFC2CD.472F4C40]AFRICAN SUMMIT: I was excited to participate in President Obama's U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit in the nation's capital -- the first such event of its kind. The Summit, the largest event any administration has held with African heads of state and government, built on the President's trip to Africa in the summer of 2013. It was encouraging to do my part to help strengthen ties between the United States and one of the world's most dynamic and fastest-growing regions. And I also got a chance to visit with some old friends from Georgia!
JUMPSTARTING THE MIDDLE CLASS: I published an op-ed in CrossRoadsNews this month outlining House Democrats' 100 Day Action Plan to help the middle class. The plan will grow the middle class by creating more jobs, provide support to women and give working-class families access to more affordable education. For more information on this initiative, click HERE . To see the op-ed in CrossRoads, click HERE .
MORE HELP FOR VETERANS: I'm pleased to announce four Atlanta-based groups will receive more than $4.6 million from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to fight veterans' homelessness.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I'm pleased to have voted on the VA health reform bill in July, and I'm committed to doing what I can to help our veterans get their lives back on track. For more, click HERE . To read about it in On Common Ground News, click HERE .
VA TOWN HALL: The Atlanta VA Regional Office is hosting a town hall for veterans, service members, their families and survivors to discuss non-medical VA benefits. Community members and organizations that assist veterans with their benefits as well as the general public are invited to attend. The town hall is being held Friday, August 29 from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Atlanta VA Regional Office, 1700 Clairmont Road, Decatur 30033.

HARP HELPING HOMEOWNERS: I was pleased to attend an important housing event this month hosted by former Congressman Mel Watt, now Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
The purpose of the meeting was to promote the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) and reach homeowners who could be eligible for this refinance program. The event highlighted the benefits of HARP and provided tools to help community leaders encourage the more than 34,000 Atlanta area residents who are still potentially eligible to participate and to take advantage of HARP. These eligible homeowners could save as much as $200 a month by refinancing their mortgage. For more, click HERE .
DISTRICT WORK PERIOD: It's been a busy but productive district work period. From visiting with folks at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport to discuss transportation issues; dropping in on a couple of farms in Newton County; speaking at the Norcross Progressive Development Committee's regular Wednesday breakfast meeting; honoring R.E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy hero Antoinette Tuff;
and visiting the Georgia Driving Academy in Conyers to discuss the trucking industry and issues that are important to hard-working truck drivers - it's been a great August District work period. For more, visit my Facebook page . Thank you!

Dear
F riends,
The overwhelming militarized response of local police forces to the protests over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri this month is an overdue wake-up call.
Americans saw firsthand what militarization of our police departments looks and feels like. With the streets of Ferguson looking like a war zone, police officers took on the look of soldiers clad in camouflage and riot gear as they aimed
their assault weapons at peaceful demonstrators from the turret of an armored personnel carrier.
Since the 1990s, the Department of Defense (DOD) has transferred $4.3 billion in military equipment to local police agencies under what&#8217;s called the 1033 Program.
I&#8217;ve
been calling for a review of this program since March . That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m introducing a bipartisan bill called the &#8220;Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act of 2014&#8221; in September to reform the program before America&#8217;s main streets and civilian police militarize
any further.
The program currently lacks meaningful oversight and accountability. We need an honest debate on the type of surplus military-grade weaponry that is appropriate for transfer from war zones to our streets.
My legislation will ban the free transfer of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs), other armored personnel carriers, armored drones, assault weapons greater than .50 caliber, silencers and certain aircraft. The legislation will
also ensure that the DOD undertakes an annual accounting of what&#8217;s been transferred, by whom and to whom, to prevent military items from being auctioned on eBay or sold to the highest bidder.
