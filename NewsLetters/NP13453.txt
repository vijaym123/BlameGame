Dear Friend,
It's hard to believe it's been nearly a year since I made my way to the
House floor to cast my very first vote as your Congressman. It was a
simple, procedural vote, but I will never forget what it felt like to
hold that new voting card in my hand and see my name projected on the
wall in the House Chamber for the first time.
Since that moment, I have cast 627 votes during my freshman year in
Congress. I've voted to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act and
against cutting billions from food stamps. I've co-sponsored 150 bills
and resolutions I believe are critically important, from raising the
minimum wage to improving the support system for our veterans. I've
introduced three pieces of my own legislation - most recently a bill to
improve access to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) education for women, minorities and economically disadvantaged
communities. I've testified twice before House Committees in support of
those bills, appearing before the Natural Resources Committee last
month to discuss my Peace Corps Commemoration Act and before the
Science & Technology Committee last week to promote a bipartisan
manufacturing bill I introduced with Republican Congressman Tom Reed.
Outside legislative chambers, we've signed onto over 200 letters with
fellow Members of Congress, seeking action on everything from local
fire department funding to trade policy to Massachusetts' cranberry
industry. We've also received invaluable input from all of you as I
navigate these policy decisions. To date, my office has responded to
69,181 letters sent by constituents inquiring about my positions and
voicing their opinions. We've consistently tried to engage with you in
new ways as well, building an ongoing conversation with our 18,824
Facebook and Twitter followers and even hosting our very first Twitter
Town Hall earlier this month!
Back home in the 4th District we've been just as busy. We've opened
three local offices, held public office hours in all 34 cities and
towns and attended 101 community events everywhere from Rehoboth to
Wrentham to Brookline. My district caseworkers have undertaken 633
constituent cases regarding everything from social security to student
loans and have managed to close 472 of them.
Between Washington and Massachusetts, we have 13 staff members, an
unfathomable number of old airline stubs with DCA?BOS stamped at the
top, and one very happy office dog. It's been memorable, challenging
and exciting - and we have you to thank for making it so special. More
than the briefings or the hearings, I always learn the most from the
folks back home, when you stopped by Tour 34 at Reese's Gas and Garage
in Dighton or took the time to come up and chat with me on the Taunton
Green. Those conversations and interactions have shaped my year.
I look forward to meeting even more of you over the next year and to
continuing what we started. Please don't hesitate to let us know how we
can better serve you. And as always, visit my website
or follow me on Facebook
and Twitter
to stay in the loop and learn about what we are up to on
any given day.
Here's wishing you and your family a very happy holiday season!
All my best,
Joe Kennedy

Dear
Friend,
It's
hard
to
believe
it's
been
nearly
a
year
since
I
made
my
way
to
the
House
floor
to
cast
my
very
first
vote
as
your
Congressman.
It
was
a
simple,
procedural
vote,
but
I
will
never
forget
what
it
felt
like
to
hold
that
new
voting
card
in
my
hand
and
see
my
name
projected
on
the

in
the
House
Chamber
for
the
first
time.
Since
that

I
have
cast
627
votes
during
my
freshman
year
in
Congress.
I've
voted
to
strengthen
the
Violence
Against
Women
Act

I've
