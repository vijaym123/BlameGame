IRS Commissioner Addresses Privacy
Concerns
During an
Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial
Services
hearing last week, I heard testimony from new IRS
Commissioner John Koskinen. I used my alotted time to ask Commissioner
Koskinen about the concerns millions of Americans have regarding actions
taken by the IRS to view private personal emails without first obtaining
a warrant or just cause. I am leading efforts to fix this breach of
4th Amendment rights with my bill, the Email Privacy Act. You can read
more by

From
the
Hill:
Legislation in the House
that would end the warrantless searches of email records is gaining
steam.
The Email Privacy Act from
Reps. Kevin
Yoder (R-Kans.) , Tom Graves (R-Ga.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.)
has 181 co-sponsors in the House, and the authors are still pushing to
get more, according to a Yoder
spokesman.
Privacy
advocates are increasingly optimistic that an update to the 1986
Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
which allows law enforcement
agencies to obtain things like emails without a warrant if they have
been stored electronically for more than 180 days
could see action
in the
House.
Commissioner Koskinen also gave us an
update on IRS efforts to reform their protocol to ensure tax-exempt
groups are no longer targeted by auditors based on political beliefs or
affiliation. Many Americans remember last year the IRS targeted mostly
conservative groups for increased scrutiny. This week Lois Lerner is to
being subpoenaed to testify on Capitol Hill as the investigation
continues. The House also voted last week and passed
H.R.
3865
- the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS by a vote
of
243-176 . I voted
" Yes ."

Also during the
hearing, I asked Commissioner Koskinen a question from John Martin, a CPA
in Overland Park, about how the IRS can be less adversarial towards
well-intentioned professional tax preparers and taxpayers who want to
navigate the IRS without fear of penalty from unintended mistakes or
misinterpretations of rules. You can watch our exchange on John's
question by

Health Premiums Rising For 2/3 of
American Small Businesses
A new Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) report released last week suggests more bad news
for America's already struggling small
businesses.
The report predicts "Obamacare could cause
premiums to increase for nearly two-thirds of small to mid-size
businesses . This results in roughly 11 million individuals whose
premiums are estimated to be higher as a result of the Affordable Care
Act."
The Affordable Care Act is
continuing to cause Americans stress and concern due to higher premium
costs and confusing deadlines and guidelines. The House will continue
to work to alleviate these complications, including by working to
delay penalties mandated on individuals. These penalties have already been
delayed for some businesses, unions and special interest groups. We
should have
fairness for all Americans under this flawed
law .

National Down Syndrome Society Congressional
Breakfast
I was honored to attend and speak at the
2014
National Down Syndrome Society Congressional Breakfast
last
week. Its important to me to energetically support legislation that
serves people with Down syndrome and their families
giving them all the
dignity they deserve.
Im a proud cosponsor of the
Achieving a Better Life Experience
(ABLE) Act
and will continue to do all I can to advance
this legislation in Congress. Thank you to Jawanda and Rachel Mast of
Olathe, as well as the
Down
Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City , for their work
and advocacy for Down syndrome
awareness.
Americans with Down syndrome live active and productive
lives with their families and communities, and doing what we can to
support these individuals will only enhance everyones life
experiences.
Working to Promote Opportunities for All
Americans
I spoke last week on the House floor after
returning to Washington following the District Work Period. I relayed how
Kansans continue to voice their frustration to me about a federal
government that creates more problems than it fixes and builds too many
barriers to success for those working to achieve the American
Dream.
The House must continue its work to pass legislation that increases
opportunities for all Americans and encourages the drive and
ingenuity that builds our great nation.

Telephone Town Hall
I held a telephone town
hall last week and appreciated the feedback I received from
constituents in the 3rd District who participated. I use telephone town halls as
one more avenue to connect with thousands of Kansans in addition to
regular town hall meetings in the
district.
Participants asked questions on a wide range of topics
during the call, including tax reform, immigration, the national debt and
federal budget, early childhood education, the President's proposed
cuts to the military and veterans and
more.
When holding a telephone town hall, we randomly
select household phone numbers within the 3rd District to call and
participate. However, if you want to be included in our next telephone town
hall, you can do so by
clicking here
and emailing me your phone number. We will then
include you during future telephone town
halls.

Kansas Wing Civil Air
Patrol
It was a pleasure to visit with members of the

Patrol . We discussed their role and courageous actions to protect our

also spoke about the Civil Air Patrol Cadets Program and the great young
men and women in their program. The three primary mission objectives
of the Civil Air Patrol are aerospace education, cadet programs and
training and emergency services.
Thank you for your work on behalf of Kansans and for your great service
to Americans.
