7th DISTRICT
August 10, 2014
Dear Friend,
With legislation
signed in to law this week significant progress has been made to ensure our
veterans receive the best medical care across the nation.
Locally, it will ensure that our success in keeping Baldwin Park VA clinic
open will be coupled with resources provided in the legislation.
With those successes, my major focus is to ensure that our returning
service men and women have access to education and employment
opportunities.
In the District
this week, I visited the
University of Central Floridas
Veterans Academic Resource Center .
This impressive program
is assisting more the 1,500 veterans with educational and career
enhancement opportunities.
I plan to work with UCF and other
institutions and employers in expanding veterans employment in our
region.
My efforts to expand Veteran's Preference in major legislation is
giving our veterans an improved opportunity at employment.
My
belief is that veterans should always be considered having been federal
employees.
The new law also expands post 9/11 GI education
benefits.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
