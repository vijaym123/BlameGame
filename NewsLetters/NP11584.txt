Join me on Friday, May 16, 2014, as I host the premier of the film,
Women Warriors: A Vision of Valor . My office helped students from Front Range Community College reach out to Colorado veterans to interview as part of a Library of Congress
Veterans History Project
film documenting the evolving role of women in war. The film follows the stories of 10 women veterans from WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, the Iraq War and Afghanistan War and compares their experiences and how they supported combat operations. This film and interview footage collected by the students will be submitted into the Library of Congress for future research and historical purposes. My staff will also be available if you have any questions about veterans or military issues. I hope to see you there!

This clinic provides primary care services for veterans in the Denver Metro, Front Range, and Mountain communities. For more information or health inquiries, please call the main clinic phone number at (303) 914-2680.
Last month, my office helped Paul set up set up an interview for his wife, Lin, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Lin began the process for obtaining a green card last year and had an interview set for August. When an urgent issue arose, Lin and Paul had to cancel the appointment. After multiple attempts to reschedule the interview but getting nowhere, Paul turned to my office for help.
&ldquo;After trying for several months, we finally have an interview scheduled. This is good news! Thanks for the help, Ed!&rdquo;
