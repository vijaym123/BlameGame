Dear Friend, I know, I know
-- another day, another email from me, asking you for money. You&rsquo;ve got to be thinking &ldquo;Every day? Really? Do we really need an email
every day? &rdquo;
Unfortunately, the short answer is yes -- this is the reality in the post- Citizens United
world. Grassroots organizations like ours are in constant danger of a well-funded super PAC jumping into our race, and since we can&rsquo;t raise millions of dollars overnight the way super PACs can, we have to steadily hit our goals. And right now, our goal is $145,OOO before the FEC filing deadline tomorrow at midnight. Get us $5 closer by making a contribution today.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
This year, with the Republicans just six seats away from taking over the Senate, we all need to step up to the plate.
The priorities we&rsquo;ve been working toward for years -- equal pay, climate change, strengthening Medicare -- are all in jeopardy if we lose the Senate. And to keep the Senate, we need to give our campaign the resources it needs to win. Getting to $145,OOO before midnight tomorrow will keep us on schedule for victory in November. By giving $5, you&rsquo;re helping to safeguard Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat, and to help prevent a Republican takeover.
Believe me when I say I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to send these emails -- that&rsquo;s part of why we&rsquo;re working to roll back
Citizens United . But until that happens, we need to stay strong, and we count on people like you to make that happen.
Thanks for your continued support.
