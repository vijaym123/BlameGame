Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
In November last year, President Obama
announced the Department of Homeland Security will expand eligibility for
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)which is scheduled to
begin February 18, 2015and create a new program for parents of U.S.
citizens and lawful permanent residents: Deferred Action for Parental
Accountability (DAPA). This is great news for families in Nevada and
across the country. Millions of families in our nation and thousands in
Nevada will no longer have to live in fear of losing a loved one to
deportation. The Presidents executive action will not only keep families
together, it will enforce our immigration laws in a way that protects
our national security and public safety. It will strengthen our economy
by creating new jobs and allowing these families to fully contribute
to the only country they call home.
I understand navigating
through application procedures can be difficult, and good help is
sometimes hard to find. That is why I worked with my staff and experts in
the field to create a number of informational resource guides, which
are available on
my website . With these resource
guides you can learn more about DAPA and DACA, learn how to file a
Freedom of Information (FOIA) request, and learn how to avoid scams and
find legitimate legal services in Nevada that can help you through
application processes.
You can view my informational
resource guides and more

While the Presidents executive action is a good first
step, it is only a temporary solution. I will continue to fight at until
we make comprehensive immigration reform a reality.
