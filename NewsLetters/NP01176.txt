David -- President Obama emailed. Vice President Biden emailed. Elizabeth Warren emailed.
But as of 9pm, we&rsquo;re still $9,764 short of our huge (but necessary) April goal -- and the FEC deadline is at midnight.
YOU could be the strong Democrat who puts us over the top!
YOU could make the difference between electing a great Democratic president and Senate that will pass progressive priorities&hellip; and suffering under years of Republican rule as all of our progress gets overturned.
Will you pitch in in the next 2 hours to help us meet our can&rsquo;t-miss April goal? Your gift will be triple-matched -- that&rsquo;s four times the impact!!
Let&#39;s do this!
