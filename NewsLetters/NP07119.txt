This week, thousands of residents across the district participated in "National Night Out," where they spent the evening with neighbors and local police to send a message to criminals that neighborhoods are organized and fighting back. Hundreds of neighborhoods held block parties, showcasing their police-community partnerships.
I'd like to give a
special thanks to Community Leaders and Local Law Enforcement personnel throughout the Fourth District for their dedication and commitment to the communities they serve.
Yours in service,
Randy
