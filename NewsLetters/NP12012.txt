Congressman Rice Returns $88,000 Back to the
Treasury
Washington, DC
Congressman
Tom Rice (SC-07) today released the following statement on returning
$88,000 of his operating budget to the
Treasury:
Every person, household, and business should operate on a
budget, including Congress, said Congressman Rice.
I am proud to
announce that my office will be returning more than $88,000 back to the
Treasury.
This number would have been well over $100,000;
however, I represent South Carolinas newly formed Seventh Congressional
District and did not inherit equipment and other office infrastructure
from a previous member.
Through careful budgeting and fiscally
responsible decisions, I was able to create and staff three fully
operating offices to serve my constituents and return thousands of left over
funds to the Treasury."
