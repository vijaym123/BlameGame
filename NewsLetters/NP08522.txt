Dear Friend,
Last week Republican Eric Cantor, the sitting House Majority Leader, lost his primary to a Tea Party candidate. This was a huge victory for the Tea Party --
and a warning that our grassroots organization needs to be ready for anything. I&rsquo;ve said that our campaign needs to be ready for the unthinkable. And we know extreme Republicans -- backed by folks like the billionaire Koch brothers -- will stop at nothing to win this November.
With control of the Senate on the line, we cannot take anything for granted. We need to raise $36,000 this month, and we need your help to get there. If you can, contribute $5 to help us stay strong against a reinvigorated Tea Party.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Eric Cantor lost because the Tea Party decided that his votes to shut down the government and end Medicare as we know it
weren&rsquo;t extreme enough . And if his positions aren&rsquo;t extreme enough for the Tea Party, you can probably imagine what they think of me --
and what they&rsquo;ll do if they take over Congress.
With this victory under their belt, the Tea Party just got one step closer to making their plans to take control of the Senate a reality. They only need six seats to take over, and we&rsquo;re not going to let Massachusetts be one of them. The Tea Party is flexing its muscles, and we need to hit our $36,000 goal to stay strong against them. Can you pitch in $5?
With your help, our campaign will be ready for whatever gets thrown our way. Thanks for all that you do.
