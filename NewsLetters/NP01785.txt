&ndash; During a visit to Iraq on Monday, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and senior lawmakers met with the country&rsquo;s leaders and our ambassador and commanders on the ground to assess efforts to defeat ISIL and combat Iran&rsquo;s rising influence.

Speaker Boehner, who last visited Iraq in 2011, issued the following statement on the delegation&rsquo;s visit to Iraq:
&ldquo;A stable, democratic, and independent Iraq remains vital to America&rsquo;s national security interests.
The United States must carefully manage the mission to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL to ensure it does not come at the expense of ceding Iraq&rsquo;s strategic independence to Iran, which does not seek to keep the country whole.
To that end, we appreciated the opportunity to have candid exchanges with Prime Minister al-Abadi and Speaker al-Jabouri.
We hope to see passage of legislation soon, especially in the areas of reconciliation, as a tangible step forward for the political solution needed in Iraq.
We also expressed strong support for increasing logistical and materiel support to the tribes in al Anbar province and hope to see additional deliveries as an immediate confidence-building move.
Iraq is a young democracy, but the United States was a young democracy once too, and we know that it takes vigilance and leadership to make it work and endure.&rdquo;

Speaker Boehner, who last met with King Abdullah at the U.S. Capitol in
December 2014 , issued the following statement on the delegation&rsquo;s visit to Jordan:

We share the belief that defeating ISIL and stopping the spread of the terrorist threat will require a comprehensive approach. That means, in addition to security responses to the instability and violence, we have to improve our strategies to counter the economic and social drivers of radicalization. King Abdullah is a good friend to the Congress and the American people, and we are grateful to him and his people for welcoming us at such a critical hour.&rdquo;
