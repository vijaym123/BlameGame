Tax Season Tips
Filing taxes can be a stressful and confusing endeavor, which is why it
is especially important in tax year 2014 to use all the resources at
your disposal. Below is information we hope will help you save time and
money this tax season. Don't forget to file your taxes by April 15th!
Free tax preparation help is available for many taxpayers
VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) trains IRS-certified volunteers
who provide free basic income tax return preparation with electronic
filing to individuals who generally earn about $53,000 or less. In
addition to VITA, the TCE (Tax Counseling for the Elderly) program
offers free tax help for senior taxpayers. To learn more, visit the
VITA/TCE page
on IRS.gov and the VITA Locator Tool
to locate the closest VITA or TCE site near

File online with Free File
To help taxpayers prepare and file their income tax returns
electronically, the IRS and the Free File Alliance have developed the
Free File program. This private-public partnership makes brand-name tax
software products available free of charge. You can prepare and e-file
your federal return for free by visiting http://www.irs.gov/freefile
. If you make less than $60,000, you will find a product
that meets your situation. Once you select the software, it does all
the work.
The ACA and Taxes
Thousands of people in Maine, and millions more around the country, are
able to afford high-quality healthcare because of the Affordable Care
Act. With the continued implementation of the new healthcare law, you
will notice some changes when you file your taxes. The individual
shared responsibility provision
of the health care law requires you and each
member of your family to have qualifying health care coverage, also
known as minimum essential coverage
. If you did not
have health insurance in 2014, you may qualify for an exemption
, or be required to make an
individual shared responsibility
payment
when filing your federal income tax return.
Taxpayer Advocate Service
The IRS has a Taxpayer Advocate Service that offers free, independent,
and confidential tax assistance to taxpayers unable to resolve their
tax problems through normal channels or individuals experiencing a
hardship. The service helps individual and business taxpayers resolve
problems with the IRS. Visit their website
for more information or call (207) 622-8528 in
the State of Maine or 1-877-777-4778 elsewhere.
