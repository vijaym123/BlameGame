News from Representative John Delaney
November 21, 2013
Dear Friend,
I write to you today to update you on my efforts to rebuild our nation's
infrastructure through the Partnership to Build America Act, H.R. 2084.
This major bipartisan legislation will finance $750 billion in needed
repairs to our nation's crumbling infrastructure, at no cost to the
taxpayer. This week, H.R. 2084 gained its 50th cosponsor in the House
of Representatives, bringing us one step closer to starting critical
work that will update our nation's infrastructure and keep our economy
competitive.
As you know, infrastructure plays a critical role in our country,
connecting millions of people with their jobs, families and more. My
bill would help to upgrade our country's aging infrastructure by
creating a $50 billion American Infrastructure Fund (AIF), leveraged to
$750 billion, through the sale of bonds offering a one percent interest
rate. Bonds sold to capitalize the AIF would not be guaranteed by the
government, ensuring that the fund does not put taxpayers at risk.
Since its introduction, H.R. 2084 has garnered substantial backing from
Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. This week, supporters
of infrastructure development won a major victory when my bill received
its 50th cosponsor in the House of Representatives, with 25 Republican
and 25 Democratic backers. While this progress is encouraging, our
focus has now shifted to the introduction of a Senate companion bill
that will continue to build on the momentum we have seen in this
Congress.
You sent me to Washington to break the partisan gridlock and rebuild
our economy, and that spirit has motivated this legislation. As the
113th Congress moves forward, I will continue to support smart,
bipartisan efforts to put our economy back on track.
I welcome your feedback on how we can achieve this goal,
John
