The water crisis will be the topic of a House Natural Resources Committee field hearing
in Fresno on Wednesday, March 19. At 9:00 a.m., just before the hearing, I will join other Members of Congress for a water rally at the Fresno City Council Chambers at 2600 Fresno Street. If you want to show your support for more water for the Central Valley, come to the rally with signs, friends, and family.
Sincerely,

Dear Friends,
Yesterday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld restrictions on water allocations meant
to protect the Delta smelt. I comment on this obnoxious

here , and I discuss it with John Batchelor
here .
