Friends,
Happy 4th of July! I hope you are able to celebrate America's
Independence Day with friends and family.
Our nation is an amazing place, and it was built on principles that
still ring true today: the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.
The freedom we enjoy today is hard-won-from the Declaration of
Independence on, we have been fighting to maintain and protect our
American way of life.
We are blessed with a country like no other in
the world, and the freedom to pursue our own dreams is an incredible
part of that life.
Continuing to Push for Answers from the VA
Several weeks ago, I wrote Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson
demanding
answers about all 13 South Carolina VA facilities. As the Obama
Administration has failed to provide answers to my questions regarding
secret waiting lists, employee bonuses and other important parts of
this scandal, I went straight to our South Carolina facilities, and am
beginning to get results.
Here's an update:

Honoring Our Veterans
America's service men and women paid a heavy price in the Vietnam War,
and we can never thank them enough.
I have had the privilege of honoring our WWII
and Korean War era veterans
for the
past two years, and this year we will have a very special ceremony
honoring all of those who served during the Vietnam War era.
On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at 10 AM at the First Baptist Church in
Columbia, all Vietnam War era veterans and their families are invited
to come and be recognized, and our doors are open to all who would like
to come and thank them for their service. More information can be found
at www.scott.senate.gov/veterans
or by calling toll-free (844) 820-0146.
Thank you for subscribing to my weekly updates-this is the best way for
me to share news and updates from Washington and at home with you.
