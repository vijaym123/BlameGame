In just 7 days, funding runs out for Homeland Security -- but Congress refuses to pass a clean funding bill. That&rsquo;s not just wrong, it&rsquo;s downright reckless.
Sign your name to tell Congress to stop threatening another shutdown:

David -- this is urgent:
There are only SEVEN days until the Department of Homeland Security shuts down, but House Republicans still refuse to pass a clean funding bill.
While the U.S. is dealing with threats both at home and abroad, this is the worst possible time to be playing political games with our security.
Join Cheri and House Democrats in demanding Congress pass a clean bill to keep Homeland Security open &gt;&gt;
A partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security would not only be a national security disaster, it would also hurt our economy.
If funding runs out, 30,000 workers would be furloughed and other critical employees would be forced to work without pay. That&rsquo;s unacceptable.
Tell Congress: NO MORE SHUTDOWNS
