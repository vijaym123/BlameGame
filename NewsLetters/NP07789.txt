The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Americas transportation and infrastructure system is the backbone of our economy. Growth and job creation all across the country depend on strategic placement and quality upkeep of our massive transportation infrastructure. This week, I managed the Rule on the House Floor for a funding extension to the Highway Trust Fund, to ensure that projects currently being implemented by the states are not delayed or interrupted. You can
watch my comments from the House Floor
to find out some of the reasons that I supported the bipartisan legislation to extend funding for federal transportation programs.
_____________ ______________________
In an era of bloated government spending, wise and calculated investments are crucial. I recently introduced a piece of transportation legislation called
TIFIA 2.0
that would offer an innovative way to increase funding availability, efficiency, and profitability without raising taxes. I recently did an interview with Cygnus Business Media regarding the bill that you can watch in their
transportation update .

Last year, I had several opportunities to partner with both corporations and community organizations in donating school supplies for students in Central Florida. This year, I kicked off these efforts again by taking two backpacks filled with school supplies to the South Lake Chamber of Commerce breakfast to assist in their Red for Ed Community School Supply Drive.

This weekend, Sandy and I are visiting our daughters family in Chicago and I am looking forward to spending time with them and our granddaughters before returning back to Washington on Tuesday.

Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Last year, a family from Orlando contacted my office after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reclaimed benefit money dating back to the passing of their father in 2003. Although the family had made numerous attempts to stop their monthly benefit check, the VA continued sending the payments. Now, the VA was reclaiming 10 years worth of payments, totaling more than $14,000.
My office submitted documentation of the attempts made by the family to notify the VA, and began working with different departments regarding the situation. Over the next nine months, my inquiries extended into ten offices and agencies within the Department of Veterans Affairs as we attempted to assist our constituents with this situation.
Finally, after countless communications, a letter was received from the VA stating, The remaining debt has been internally cleared and the family will not be held accountable to repay any additional monies toward this debt.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Continuing conflict between Israel and the U.S. Department of State-designated terrorist organization Hamas has dominated global news this week. While the violence briefly subsided during the temporary cease-fire that Israel called to allow food and humanitarian aid to reach the civilians in Gaza, Hamas-launched rockets continue to be fired into Israel.
Do you believe that Israel has a right to defend itself against these attacks?

Legislative Update:
Over the past couple of years, it has been a privilege to visit countless charitable organizations and volunteer initiatives throughout our district. On Thursday, I voted for the bipartisan
America Gives More Act of 2014,
which would ensure the tax code is not a deterrent to charitable giving and the magnanimous organizations who serve our communitys least fortunate. Central Florida is one of our nations most charitable regions, and I am honored to represent it in Congress.
