MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now before the critical FEC deadline at midnight, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
David -- We just got a look at the latest poll -- and we have some great news:
DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD!
All of our hard work is paying off! Together, we can deliver a crushing blow to Boehner in this election!!! But first, we HAVE to close this budget gap.
One Republican billionaire just gave $1O,OOO,OOO to a Karl Rove front group. We&rsquo;re trying to play catch-up -- but the federal fundraising deadline is TOMORROW.
That means we HAVE to hit 1OO,OOO donations to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline.
David -- this race is too close to let a last-minute billionaire-backed ad blitz cost us the election. Can you chip in whatever you can today? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts
Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
It&rsquo;s great to have a lead (finally!) but we should be clear-eyed about this. The race for Congress is still a complete toss-up. Today&rsquo;s poll shows us up by 1-point, 4O% to 39%. But after the beating we&rsquo;ve taken from the Republicans and the Super PACs, we&rsquo;ll take good news wherever we can get it!
Now, it&rsquo;s up to us to take advantage of this opportunity. And that means falling short on tomorrow&rsquo;s fundraising deadline is NOT an option.
Please -- stop what you&rsquo;re doing, answer President Obama&rsquo;s request, and help us stop Republicans from buying this election with their secret right-wing money.
We need 6 donors from 60659 by tonight&rsquo;s midnight fundraising deadline to close the gap.
