CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
November 22, 2013
This was an historic and unfortunate week for the
United States Senate.
The President and Harry Reids decision to
use the nuclear option to change the longstanding rules of the Senate
was a blatant attempt to change the debate about the Democrats
health care plan as the consequences of this disastrous law are felt around
the country.
The American people know what they get when the
minority party is stripped of its filibuster rights: they get unchecked
power by the Executive Branch.
The President and Harry Reid
might not like the fact that the Framers intentionally designed the Senate
to be a deliberative body, but this check on a tyrannical majority
has worked well for our nation for over 200 years.
If sweeping
legislation and lifetime appointments cannot muster 60 votes in the
United States Senate, then it probably is not a good idea to force either
on the American people.
Just this week, weve seen
what can happen when the minority and the majority work together.
On Monday, the Senate passed the
Drug Quality and Security
Act , culminating a two and half year effort led by Senator Michael Bennet
(D-CO) and myself to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to
work with stakeholders to determine how we can create a system that
will restore confidence in the safety and security of our supply
chain.
Our bipartisan bill will provide the tools to appropriately
respond to crises like the meningitis outbreak last year and give
Americans the peace of mind to know that the medicines they take are safe and
effective.
This bill is a model of what can be
accomplished through hard work and pragmatism in Congress.
The bipartisan
effort earned the support of consumer groups, business groups, and many
others.
In direct contrast, the actions taken by the
Democrats will pave the way for more unpopular laws like Obamacare and will
do lasting damage to bipartisanship, the Senate, and the
nation.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
