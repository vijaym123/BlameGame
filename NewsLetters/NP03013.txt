In a meeting this week with House Republicans, Speaker Boehner told Members that he is working on a plan
to authorize a lawsuit against President Obama , challenging Obama's executive action on immigration.
In November of last year, President Obama announced his plans to use executive action to change the immigration laws of this country and exempt from deportation millions of undocumented immigrants currently living here illegally. In January, the House
passed legislation
halting the President's executive action, including deferred action for childhood arrivals .
That legislation, however, faces challenge in the Senate where the measure may have difficulty garnering enough Democratic support for the three-fifths majority vote needed to overcome a filibuster.
Question of the Week:
Do you support a House-led lawsuit designed to curtail the use of executive amnesty?
(
) Yes.
(
) No.
(
) I am unsure.
(
) Other.
