Friends,
I wanted to remind you about our Seventh
District
Telephone Town Hall Meeting tonight at 5:35
p.m.
We
will discuss the Presidents Fiscal Year 2015 budget plan he unveiled
today, so I can express your concerns tomorrow during my House
Budget Committee hearing.
The Presidents Office of Management and Budget Director, Sylvia
Burwell is scheduled to testify tomorrow and I look forward to asking
her your questions.
As you know, the crisis in Ukraine is getting hostile. We will
also discuss the situation in Ukraine, Chairman Camp's tax reform
discussion draft, and I will answer any other questions you may have.
