Dear David,
On Veterans Day, we come together to honor the brave men and women who have served our nation valiantly. As we mark Veterans Day, it is not only a time to thank our Veterans for their service, but to also acknowledge the debt we owe them for protecting us and preserving our freedom. We must also recognize the sacrifices of the families of veterans &ndash; by the mothers and fathers and especially the spouses and children.
While today highlights the heroic service of our Veterans, we must honor their sacrifices every day of the year. Serving our veterans requires actions not just words. As Americans we must ensure that all veterans have what they need when they return home, especially healthcare, education and employment opportunities.
I look forward to continue working in a bipartisan way to ensure our veterans and their families receive a level of care and service worthy of their sacrifice.
Sincerely,
