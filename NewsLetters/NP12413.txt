Dear
Friends,
As you may know, the U.S.
Postal Service has been
experiencing hard times
recently.Due to
Congressional inaction, the
Postal Service has been
forced to implement draconian
cuts over the past few years,
reducing its workforce and
even closing or consolidating
its mail facilities.
Thats why Ive
been working for years with
members on both sides of the
aisle to pass legislation
that will help save the
Postal Service and ensure
that facilities, like Hares
Corner here in Delaware,
remain open and able to serve
the public for the
foreseeable future. Last
week, I was proud to help
lead the effort to pass
bipartisan, comprehensive
postal reform legislation
that I co-authored with
Republican Senator Dr. Tom
Coburn (R-OK) through the
Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs
Committee, which I chair. Our
legislation will help the
Postal Service modernize,
right-size and innovate.
As the bill moves to the
Senate floor, I thought it
would be useful to create a
website to explain the
challenges facing
thePostal Service and
how our legislation will make
the necessary changes to help
fix its problems for the long
haul.
You
can check out my new
website here.
As always, I welcome
hearing from all of you on
this topic, or any
other. Please continue
to let me know what issues
are important to you by
