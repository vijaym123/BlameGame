Today, on the
70 th
anniversary of D-Day, we honor the brave men who stormed the
beaches of Normandy, turning the tide of World War II.
Over
150,000 Allied forces landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944, and over 16
million Americans fought in World War II. We will always be grateful for the
service and sacrifice of our World War II vets.
We owe them
everything, and we must never forget them.
While reflecting on
Americas heroes, I was reminded of an amazing experience I had just
seven days ago: Last Friday, my wife Becca and I had the opportunity to
watch the historic
Evening Parade
at the Marine
Barracks in Washington, D.C.
This parade
which is open to the
public every Friday between now and August 29
is a wonderful
patriotic event featuring incredible music and precision marching from the
Oldest Post of the Corps (it was founded in 1801).
According to the Marine
Barracks website, the Evening Parade was conceived as a balanced pageant
that would perfectly match the splendor of its old fashioned
settingUsing the resplendent setting of the Barracks, wistful imagination and
the Marines' flare for showmanship, the parades were to be a showcase
for the ceremonial prowess of Marines and the musical eminence of the
U.S. Marine.
As someone who watched the 75-minute
performance first-hand, I can tell you that the Evening Parade lives up to its
promise to be a universal symbol of the professionalism, discipline,
and Esprit de Corps of the United States Marines.
I was
genuinely moved by the beauty of their art and the pride they showed in
sharing it with us.
Indeed, the professionalism and hospitality of
everyone there
from our host to the performers to the generals
was
first-rate and exemplified the best of America.
I cant imagine
that Ill ever forget it.
At the parade, I was able to
speak with General James F. Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps.
While many people dont realize it, General Amos
Americas
highest-ranking Marine
is a native of Idaho.
He was born in Wendell,
Idaho and is a University of Idaho graduate.
A man of tremendous
achievement
hes held command at all levels from Lieutenant Colonel
to Lieutenant General
hes one of many reasons to be proud of the Gem
State.
If you have a chance to visit Washington, D.C. this
summer
and youre interested in attending the Evening Parade
please
be sure to
contact my office
in advance.
Were available to help you get tickets (and I should mention that
admission is free).
The memories youll experience will last a
lifetime.
And your connection to Americas greatness will reach new
heights.
