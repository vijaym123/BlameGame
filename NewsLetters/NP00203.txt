June 2015
Dear Friend,
I begin this month's newsletter with some exciting news from my home in
Richland Parish.
Last month, the Richardson Medical Center in Rayville was facing
closure after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said it was no
longer going to reimburse it for service to patients who use those
programs.
I wrote a letter to CMS asking for a review of the hospital's case. CMS
agreed and discovered it had made an error. The hospital will remain
open.
I was happy to intervene on behalf of the hospital because I believe
that our rural neighbors deserve the same access to health care that
those in cities enjoy. That's why I opened my medical clinic in
Mangham. I embraced the role of a country doctor because it's a role
that needed to be filled.
Listed in this newsletter is a summary of some of the other things I've
been up to over the past month.
Recent Legislation
Congressman Ralph Abraham speaks to the American Legion in Monroe at a
Memorial Day event about his efforts to protect veterans' access to
their benefits and health care.
Veterans Bills:
I helped pass seven bills to help our veterans.
The Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act requires the Department of
Veterans Affairs to retain a copy of any reprimand received by an
employee of the department in his or her permanent record. VA employees
simply need to be more accountable to the heroes they are supposed to
serve. As the chairman of the VA Subcommittee on Disability and
Memorial Affairs, bringing real reform to the VA is one of my top
legislative priorities.
The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of
2015 makes sure our veterans who need assistance have access to
affordable housing.
The Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015 excludes Veterans
Affairs aid from being considered as family income for the purposes of
HUD housing assistance programs.
The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015 reauthorizes the U.S. Coast
Guard and Federal Maritime Commission through the end of Fiscal Year
2017 and authorizes $8.7 billion for the Coast guard for fiscal 2016
and 2017.
The Veterans I.D. Card Act requires the VA to issue an identification
card to any covered veteran who request such a card and who was
discharged from the armed forces under honorable conditions.
The Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act will allow
a surviving spouse of a veteran who has a service-connected disability
rating of less than 100 percent and who has not died because of the
service-connected disability to retain the veterans small business
preferred status for up to three years after the veterans death.
The Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act gives preference
to private contractors that employ veterans.
Regulatory Integrity Protection Act:
I cosponsored a bill that stops
the federal overreach of the Environmental Protection Agency and
protects the rights of farmers and landowners. This bill withdraws the
proposed Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) ruling. It requires the EPA and the
Army Corps of Engineers to develop a new rule to define navigable
waters of the U.S. Under this act, the EPA must act in accordance with
the limits set by Congress and the Supreme Court to ensure that the
rights of landowners are not violated. This bill also requires that the
new rule be constructed with consultation from local officials,
stakeholders and other interested parties. Those who will be most
affected by any new rules will have the largest hand in crafting any
new policy, and the EPA will have to publish a public report to prove
it is working with locals throughout the process.
You can read more about my position on WOTUS by reading my column from
last month here
USA Freedom Act:
This bill ends the NSA's bulk collection of data
while still keeping intact key provisions of former laws that aid our
law enforcement agencies in monitoring terrorist activities. This bill
will add provisions to the USA Patriot Act by limiting government
surveillance opportunities, keep the NSA accountable for its actions
and protect privacy rights guaranteed to American citizens under the
Constitution.
Financial Transparency Act of 2015: I cosponsored this bill with
Congressman Darrell Issa in efforts to amend securities, commodities
and banking laws to make the information reported to financial
regulatory agencies electronically searchable. The bill is a bipartisan
effort that would apply modern data standards to financial regulatory
information. This bill will make financial regulatory agencies more
transparent while reducing reliance on outdated paper disclosures.
Social Media
I try to provide updates daily on how I'm representing you both in
Washington and at home in Louisiana. So much of the world is driven by
social media these days, and that's why it's important that you make
sure that you're subscribed to my pages. Please check to see that
you've "liked" us on Facebook
and followed us on Twitter
. You can do so by clicking the links.
In the District
I met with Kentwood Mayor Irma Gordon, Village of Tangipahoa Mayor
Brenda Nevels, Tangipahoa Parish President Gordon Burgess and
Tangipahoa Parish Councilman Trent Forrest and constituents at the
Kentwood Cafe.
I had the privilege of meeting with Frank and Georgia Williams
following a Traveling Vietnam Wall ceremony in Vidalia. Frank is an
89-year-old veteran of World War II, and chatting with him was an honor
for me.
I addressed the Alexandria Rotary Club and spoke with constituents
about the issues facing our nation.
I was the keynote speaker at the Ruston Kiwanis Club meeting.
Congressman Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, joined me for a great
discussion about the Waters of the U.S. rule that we both oppose.
I met with the Jackson Parish Police Jurors Todd Culpepper, Maxie
Monroe, Lynn Treadway and Eddie Langston as well as Jury attorney
Darrell Avery and secretary Kenneth Pardue at the courthouse in
Jonesboro. We had a great discussion about how my office is available
to assist the people of Jackson Parish.

About
June
2015
Dear
Friend,
I
begin
this
month's
newsletter
with
some
exciting
news
from
my
home
in
Richland
Parish.
Last
month,
the
Richardson
Medical
Center
in
Rayville
was
facing
closure
after
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
said
it
was
no
longer
going
to
reimburse
it
for
service
to
patients
who
use
those
programs.
I
wrote
a
letter
to
CMS
asking
for
a
review
of
the
hospital's
case.
CMS
agreed
and
discovered
it
had
made
an
error.
The
hospital
will
remain
open.
I
was
happy
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
the
hospital
because
I
believe
that
our
rural
neighbors
deserve
the
same
access
to
health
care
that
those
in
cities
enjoy.
That's
why
I
opened
my
medical
clinic
in
Mangham.
I
embraced
the
role
of
a
country
doctor
because
it's
a
role
that
needed
to
be
filled.
Listed
in
this
newsletter
is
a
summary
of
some
of
the
other
things
I've
been
up
to
over
the
past
month.
Recent
Legislation
Congressman
Ralph
Abraham
speaks
to
the
American
Legion
in
Monroe
at
a
Memorial
Day
event
about
his
efforts
to
protect
veterans'
access
to
their
benefits
and
health
care.
Veterans
Bills:
I
helped
pass
seven
bills
to
help
our
veterans.
The
Ensuring
VA
Employee
Accountability
Act
requires
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
retain
a
copy
of
any
reprimand
received
by
an
employee
of
the
department
in
his
or
her
permanent
record.
VA
employees
simply
need
to
be
more
accountable
to
the
heroes
they
are
supposed
to
serve.
As
the
chairman
of
the
VA
Subcommittee
on
Disability
and
Memorial
Affairs,
bringing
real
reform
to
the
VA
is
one
of
my
top
legislative
priorities.
The
Homeless
Veterans&#146;
Reintegration
Programs
Reauthorization
Act
of
2015
makes
sure
our
veterans
who
need
assistance
have
access
to
affordable
housing.
The
Vulnerable
Veterans
Housing
Reform
Act
of
2015
excludes
Veterans
Affairs
aid
from
being
considered
as
family
income
for
the
purposes
of
HUD
housing
assistance
programs.
The
Coast
Guard
Authorization
Act
of
2015
reauthorizes
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
and
Federal
Maritime
Commission
through
the
end
of
Fiscal
Year
2017
and
authorizes
$8.7
billion
for
the
Coast
guard
for
fiscal
2016
and
2017.
The
Veteran&#146;s
I.D.
Card
Act
requires
the
VA
to
issue
an
identification
card
to
any
covered
veteran
who
request
such
a
card
and
who
was
discharged
from
the
armed
forces
under
honorable
conditions.
The
Service
Disabled
Veteran
Owned
Small
Business
Relief
Act
will
allow
a
surviving
spouse
of
a
veteran
who
has
a
service-connected
disability
rating
of
less
than
100
percent
and
who
has
not
died
because
of
the
service-connected
disability
to
retain
the
veteran&#146;s
small
business
&#147;preferred
status&#148;
for
up
to
three
years
after
the
veteran&#146;s
death.
The
Boosting
Rates
of
American
Veteran
Employment
Act
gives
preference
to
private
contractors
that
employ
veterans.
Regulatory
Integrity
Protection
Act:
I
cosponsored
a
bill
that
stops
the
federal
overreach
of
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
and
protects
the
rights
of
farmers
and
landowners.
This
bill
withdraws
the
proposed
Waters
of
the
U.S.
(WOTUS)
ruling.
It
requires
the
EPA
and
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
to
develop
a
new
rule
to
define
navigable
waters
of
the
U.S.
Under
this
act,
the
EPA
must
act
in
accordance
with
the
limits
set
by
Congress
and
the
Supreme
Court
to
ensure
that
the
rights
of
landowners
are
not
violated.
This
bill
also
requires
that
the
new
rule
be
constructed
with
consultation
from
local
officials,
stakeholders
and
other
interested
parties.
Those
who
will
be
most
affected
by
any
new
rules
will
have
the
largest
hand
in
crafting
any
new
policy,
and
the
EPA
will
have
to
publish
a
public
report
to
prove
it
is
working
with
locals
throughout
the
process.
You
can
read
more
about
my
position
on
WOTUS
by
reading
my
column
from
last
month
here .
USA
Freedom
Act:
This
bill
ends
the
NSA's
bulk
collection
of
data
while
still
keeping
intact
key
provisions
of
former
laws
that
aid
our
law
enforcement
agencies
in
monitoring
terrorist
activities.
This
bill
will
add
provisions
to
the
USA
Patriot
Act
by
limiting
government
surveillance
opportunities,
keep
the
NSA
accountable
for
its
actions
and
protect
privacy
rights
guaranteed
to
American
citizens
under
the
Constitution.
Financial
Transparency
Act
of
2015:
I
cosponsored
this
bill
with
Congressman
Darrell
Issa
in
efforts
to
amend
securities,
commodities
and
banking
laws
to
make
the
information
reported
to
financial
regulatory
agencies
electronically
searchable.
The
bill
is
a
bipartisan
effort
that
would
apply
modern
data
standards
to
financial
regulatory
information.
This
bill
will
make
financial
regulatory
agencies
more
transparent
while
reducing
reliance
on
outdated
paper
disclosures.
