Dear
Friend,
The Hudson Valley lost two
of its neighbors in Sundays tragic accident. Our hearts are breaking
for those who lost loves ones and for every New Yorker impacted by
Sundays Metro-North
derailment.
Metro-North is an integral part of life for all of us in the Hudson
Valley. We must do everything in our power to ensure that such a tragedy
never happens again. Ive been working closely with the National
Transportation Safety Board and MTA as they continue to investigate this
accident and issue their safety recommendations.
After visiting the site of the derailment with NTSB
officials, I announced legislation, the Commuter Rail Passenger Safety
Act, to help commuter rail lines like Metro-North fund and implement
positive train control (PTC) systems. PTC is proven technology that
can prevent collisions, switching mistakes and derailments caused by
excessive speed. In 2008, Congress passed a law mandating PTC systems for
commuter and freight railroads, however there have been difficulties
meeting this deadline due to bureaucratic inefficiency and lack of
funding.
The NTSB has said that PTC
would have prevented Sundays derailment. We must not let red tape get
in the way of averting a similar tragedy.
My legislation
ensures commuter rail lines can invest in this technology through a series
of existing loan programs and a new grant program. Installing positive
train control systems in our commuter rail systems is the single most
important step towards reducing human error and saving
lives.
I continue my focus on fighting for the
safety of commuters in the Hudson Valley. If I can ever be of
assistance, please contact my office in Newburgh at
845-561-1259.
Sincerely,
Sean Patrick
