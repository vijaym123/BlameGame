Blaine's Bulletin
Many of us have a mother, sister, daughter, or another loved one who has been diagnosed, suffered, and fought breast cancer. And with Americans across the country observing Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I wanted to continue my ongoing effort to raise awareness about the critical need to prevent and cure this cancer.
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, nearly one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and there are an estimated 4,610 new cases of breast cancer that will be diagnosed in Missouri this year.
One of the best ways to fight breast cancer is with early detection. Theres a straight-forward, three-step approach to breast cancer screening: getting an annual mammograms beginning at age 40; clinical breast exams at least every three years beginning at age 20, and annually from age 40; and monthly breast self-exam beginning at age 20.
A mammogram remains the gold standard for the early detection of breast cancer. A mammogram can detect breast cancer early before the tumor has grown large enough to be felt or to result in other symptoms. Fortunately, significant improvements have been made in adherence to routine mammograms after reaching 40 years of age. The percentage of women receiving a mammogram increased from 29 percent in 1987 to 70 percent in 2000.
However, many do not have access to mammograms which is why I am proud to be the sponsor of the Mobile Mammography Promotion Act which would increase access to breast cancer screening by providing relief from the federal fuel excise tax for mammovans, vehicles designed exclusively to provide mobile mammography services that travel to underserved areas. Such relief already exists within the tax code for blood collection and this bill would simply add vehicles primarily providing mammography services to the list. My bill would make regular mammography screenings a reality for those many underserved individuals.
It is important that we remember the importance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and encourage our loved ones to take an active role in helping to protect their health through early detection and screening.
