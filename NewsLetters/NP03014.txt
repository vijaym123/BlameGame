Friends,
On Wednesday, I voted for the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, which would streamline the permitting process for exporting liquefied natural gas. First and foremost, this common-sense legislation is a jobs bill. By simplifying the complicated permitting process to export liquefied natural gas, we can put as many as 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work. And by increasing exports, the bill also provides security for us at home and for our allies abroad by creating another counter weight to hostile nations that gain influence through energy production. I hope the Senate and President will move quickly to turn this bipartisan legislation into law.
Ending Human Trafficking
This week, the House agreed to 12 bills that combat human trafficking nationally and internationally. America should be a place of freedom and opportunity for all. Tragically, for human trafficking victims, its a place of oppression and despair. This horrific industry traps young people in a darkness that is often described as modern day slavery. As the father of three teenagers, including two daughters, Im especially proud to cast these votes. We must do everything possible to end human trafficking.
One Step Closer
Just yesterday, the Senate passed legislation to authorize construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline by a bipartisan vote of 62-36, moving it one step closer to approval. I applaud my colleagues in the Senate for passing this common-sense jobs bill. The Keystone XL Pipeline will create more than 40,000 jobs and add billions of dollars to our economy. Even though the president has threatened to veto legislation approving this pipeline, I truly hope that, once a bill is sitting on his desk, he will not turn his back on all of the Americans who would have the opportunity to work as a result of this pipeline.
Looking Ahead
I was pleased to learn from House leaders yesterday that well be voting on a bill to repeal Obamacare in its entirety next week. We need real health care reform that puts patients first and expands choice, not Obamacares top-down mandates that have resulted in higher premiums, limited choice and the cancellation of millions of health care plans.

Freedom first,
Graves says Obama free college plan too costly, might interfere with HOPE grant
I know that many of our constituents wisely work hard, keep up good grades and earn those [HOPE] grants and scholarships. The last thing Id want is the federal government creating a different program that discounts and devalues all the work others have done...I dont want to see the federal government getting in the middle and messing it up.
