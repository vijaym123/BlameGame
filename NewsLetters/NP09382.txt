Dear David,
As families across
the Capital Region celebrate Memorial Day, please join me in taking a
moment to remember the many soldiers and their loved ones who have
sacrificed so much for our nation. While we can never repay the debt of
gratitude we owe to these brave men and women, we pay tribute to them
today by remembering all that they do for the freedoms we
enjoy.
For veterans and active duty service members, we
must work every day to make good on promises they receive the day they
entered service. That means providing quality health care, housing,
and job opportunities as they return home and take the next step in
their lives in New York. Thank you to those who have served and those who
continue to serve today. Happy Memorial
Day.
Thank you, as always for reading. If my office can be of
assistance to you in any way, please do not hesitate to call. My door is
always open.
