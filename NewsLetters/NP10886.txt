This year's winner will be chosen by the public through an online vote and will join past winners from schools such as Iowa City High School and Central Lee High School in Donnellson. The winning student will be invited to Washington, D.C. to attend a reception held in their honor and will have his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year.
