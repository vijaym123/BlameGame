Click here to denounce Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s frivolous lawsuit against President Obama &gt;&gt;
Boehner&rsquo;s using taxpayer dollars to file a baseless lawsuit against President Obama. Instead of focusing on issues that matter to everyday Americans, House Republicans are trying to score political points. David, sign our petition to denounce Boehner&rsquo;s baseless lawsuit.
David, let&rsquo;s be clear about something:
The GOP&rsquo;s lawsuit against President Obama is a sham.
It&rsquo;s nothing but a theatrical, taxpayer-funded attempt to distract voters from the true obstructionists: Speaker Boehner and his right-wing majority.
For too long, Boehner and the Tea Party have blocked just about every solution Democrats have put forward.
Now, when the President takes executive action on the most pressing issues to our nation, Republicans throw up their hands and announce a lawsuit. David, enough is enough. Will you stand with Brad and leaders across the country to denounce the House Republican&rsquo;s taxpayer-funded lawsuit?
