Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last weekend, I joined fellow members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure at a field hearing in my hometown of Charleston, West Virginia, to conduct oversight regarding the recent chemical spill into the Elk River. We heard from local residents concerned about the safety and quality of water being piped into their homes, farms and small businesses, and from national, state, and county environmental and homeland security officials. You can watch highlights from the Committee by

The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee also met this week to discuss the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014, which funds the U.S. Coast Guards mission to ensure our continued maritime safety and security. I am grateful for the members of our Coast Guard who work to keep America safe and strong.

As you know, on September 11, 2012, the United States experienced a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that included an invasion of our consulate and claimed the life of four Americans, including the first U.S. Ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979. Earlier this week, the House Armed Services Committee released their report on Benghazi, which is
now available online . While this report tells part of the story, America deserves a full accounting of this tragedy so that we may ensure it never happens again. I have co-sponsored legislation calling for a Select Committee on Benghazi to conduct an exhaustive investigation, and to seek justice for the four Americans killed in the terrorist attacks in Libya.

Despite the winter storm that blanketed the East Coast this week, municipal leaders from Polk County came to my office to discuss local issues and represent the Florida League of Cities. I was glad to welcome Winter Haven Commissioners Mayor J.P. Powell, Commissioners Peter Chichetto, Brad Dantzler, and City Manager Deric Feacher, as well as several other local leaders from around the State, into my office and hear their thoughts and updates regarding the City of Winter Haven.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
When a constituent was re-deploying to the United States from Afghanistan, one of the large parcels that he shipped home ended up in another state. After tracking it down, the constituent was told he would have to pay to have it shipped to Orlando. Because the shipment weighed approximately 150 pounds and he had been working on retrieving his cargo for a year, he asked our office for assistance in getting this resolved. My office contacted the Army Liaison, and after many follow up phone calls and emails, we were able to arrange for the veteran to finally receive his shipment free of charge.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Once again, pressure on the White House triggered another Obamacare delay for businesses, but not individuals and families who continue to be the biggest losers in the White Houses delay sweepstakes.
Do you believe the President is overextending his executive powers by continuing to unilaterally modify Obamacare?

Legislative Update:
Several weeks ago, I voted against a bill that cut the cost of living adjustments promised to military personnel in order to save money. Regrettably, that bill passed and those cuts went into effect. This week, I was pleased that my colleagues joined me in overwhelmingly supporting legislation that restores these benefits to our veterans. Through the years, the men and women of our Armed Forces have selflessly served our country, and they deserve the compensation that the United States government has pledged to provide. We owe our veterans a debt that we can never repay, and must honor their service by keeping the commitments that we promised.
