This week, the Secretaries and Chiefs of our military services appeared before the House Armed Services Committee to testify on the annual national defense budget proposal, addressing whether it adequately meets the needs of each of the services. Congressman Forbes questioned each of the Chiefs on whether they will be able to provide for todays national security and prepare for tomorrows threats under the current defense budget. The Chiefs testified that budget constraints are jeopardizing both current capabilities and future readiness. Watch the testimony,

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter also testified before the Committee in a separate hearing, defending the Presidents budget proposal. Congressman Forbes questioned the Secretary about the impacts of sequestration to Americas national security. Even though Secretary Carter acknowledged that sequestration would be devastating for the military and cause a crisis in national defense, he stated his support of the Administrations determination to veto any bill that lifts sequestration from defense, if it does not also lift it from the IRS, EPA, and other federal agencies that are not related to national security.

Over the past six years, the U.S. military has faced a series of significant cuts, resulting in the reality that America now has the smallest Army since before World War II, a Navy among the smallest since World War I, and an Air Force whose top general says it may not be able to control the skies in a future conflict. Congressman Forbes has been a leading voice in the House of Representatives on the importance of investing in tomorrows military and a strong national defense.
