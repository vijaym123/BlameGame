The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
This week, veteran leaders from all parts of our district joined me as I hosted a Veterans Roundtable with Congressman Jeff Miller, Chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs. Chairman Miller and I shared an update on the current situation within the VA, as well as legislative progress we have made to enhance quality and timely care for veteran medical services. It was an honor to facilitate this discussion with some of our local veterans in order to express our gratitude for their sacrifices, hear their experiences with the VA, and keep them up to date on the work we are doing to serve them.

On Monday, I spent the day in Umatilla, starting off with the Breakfast for Educators at Umatilla Elementary School. It was a pleasure to join the Umatilla Chamber, Mayor Laura Wright, and Principal Debra Rogers to honor these dedicated teachers, thank them for their faithful work to educate our children, and celebrate the upcoming school year.
Some of the other stops I made in Umatilla included:
-	Shananne Cain Florist, where I received a fresh boutonnire
-	North Lake Outpost to hear comments and concerns they receive from the community
-	Lucs Fish n Chix, a favorite local diner
-	Bagels, Breads &amp; More where I bought samples of fresh baked goods
-	A&amp;M Auto Parts, who had three generations of Merrill family owners present
-	The Umatilla Women's Club, where I proudly sported my Umatilla t-shirt
-	Central Avenue Treat Market, owned by Cathy Hanstein
-	Umatilla Kiwanis Club, where I provided a Congressional update

I also spent a day on International Drive with Lex Veech, who heads up the Government Affairs for the Orange County Convention Center, and Maria Triscari, president of the International Drive Resort Area Chamber of Commerce. Both have been heavily involved in the development and economic growth of the I-Drive region, and it was great to hear their thoughts and perspectives. Some of the stops along our driving tour included:
-	Wyndham Orlando Resort recent renovations
-	Orlando Eye construction site with Chuck Whittall
-	Hyatt Regency and their plans for a pedestrian bridge
-	International Drive Resort Area Chambers, where I spoke at their monthly luncheon

Yesterday, I was privileged to participate in Florida Polytechnic Universitys launch celebration. As an engineer, I enjoyed receiving a tour of the impressive new facility and being updated on the programs and educational training that they will be offering in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
This week, I was able to spend quite a bit of time in Polk County, and visited many different locations, including:
-	Visit Central Floridas Polk Outpost 27 in Davenport
-	The new Parent Resource Center in Winter Haven
-	First United Methodist Churchs thrift shop in Lake Alfred
-	Dropping off school supplies to the Lake Alfred Chamber
-	Speaking to students at the Congressional Classroom Orientation
-	Visiting small businesses on Main Street in Winter Haven
-	Speaking at the Auburndale Vietnam Veterans Meeting
-	First Presbyterian Churchs Soup Kitchen in Winter Haven
These visits are just a sample of the many opportunities I had to interact with and hear from constituents this week. For more pictures and information on these and additional stops that I made in the district, you can follow me on Twitter

Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Umatilla contacted my office regarding an overpayment notice from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Although the constituent had only started receiving benefits last year, he was informed that a substantial overpayment had accrued on his record.
Confused on how this could have happened, the constituent reached out to my office. We submitted a Congressional Inquiry on his behalf, and received word from SSA that they had recalculated his benefits and determined that not only was there no overpayment on this record, but that the constituent had actually been underpaid. A retro check was issued, and the constituent expressed his appreciation of the assistance we provided.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
President Obama has authorized air strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) terrorist group in Iraq. Although they began as a small terrorist cell birthed by al-Qaeda, the ISIS militants have grown and expanded into performing operations that threaten the security and safety of Americans and our allies.
Do you believe the threat of ISIS should have been extinguished before it ballooned into its current strength, which threatens to further erode the stability of the region and endanger religious minorities, including Christians?
Yes
No
I don't know

Legislative Update:
Over the past couple of months, I have visited VA clinics, waiting rooms, vet centers, and veteran organizations all around our Central Florida community. Although all indications are that Central Florida has not faced problems of the same magnitude as other areas of the country, I want to know if any of our local veterans are experiencing an issue with the VA.
In Washington, I voted in favor of legislation which will empower the VA Secretary to fire staffers who underperform or are guilty of malfeasance. Those responsible for this catastrophe are being held accountable, but my primary, ongoing focus is to make this right for veterans who have served our country.
While the VA undergoes systemic changes to its health care delivery and scheduling processes, it is critical that we ensure our vets have access to the care they were promised. The legislation I supported also funds the hiring of additional doctors and medical staff to treat vets at VA facilities and opens up additional avenues for vets to receive the timely, quality medical care they deserve.
Veterans deserve our deepest respect and it is unconscionable and completely unacceptable that the brave men and women who have put on the uniform and faithfully served our country would be denied the timely, critical care and services we have promised to provide.
