Update from Senator Bob Corker
July 12,
2014
Honoring the Life of Howard Baker
In remarks on the
U.S. Senate floor Monday, Senator Corker joined Senator Lamar Alexander
(R-Tenn.) in honoring the life of former Senate Majority Leader Howard
H. Baker, Jr. (R-Tenn.). Last week, Corker attended the funeral
service of Senator Baker in Huntsville, Tennessee, where Alexander gave the
eulogy .
He [Howard Baker] was an
inspiration to all of us. When we were around him, his graciousness
and humility caused all of us, I think, to be much better people, said
Corker. He had an impact on this nation. And I just feel it is a
great privilege and honor to stand with you [Sen. Alexander] today to
acknowledge his greatness as a person and his greatness as a
senator.
Corker added, I know that each of us strive to carry
out those characteristics that Howard Baker so wisely showed us the
United States Senate would be a much better place if all of us could
embody those characteristics...

Long-Term
Highway Funding Solution Needed
On Thursday,
Senator Corker called on the Senate to address a long-term,
sustainable solution to the Highway Trust Fund shortfall by the year-end rather
than continue temporary patches put forth by the Senate Finance
Committee and House Ways and Means Committee. Late Wednesday, the Senate
Finance Committee announced legislation to temporarily patch the Highway
Trust Fund by transferring nearly $10 billion from the general fund
to be spent over the next few months and pay for it over 10 years using
budget gimmicks. Earlier this week, Corker
blaste d
a similar bill in the House Ways and Means
Committee.
Republicans and Democrats need to stop
this ongoing practice of generational theft
spending money over a few
months and paying for it over a decade, said Corker. I urge my
Senate colleagues to commit to passing a long-term solution by year-end so
we can fund our nations transportation projects responsibly by
paying for them in the same timeframe the money is spent.
The
federal Highway Trust Fund provides half of the countrys spending on
transportation projects and will run dry in August, likely halting
the construction of any new transportation projects without action from
Congress. This will result in a 50 percent reduction in Tennessees
transportation budget in 2015 and create a $160 billion hole in state
budgets nationwide over the next decade at a time when they can least
afford it.
Last month, Corker and Senator Chris Murphy
(D-Conn.) announced a bipartisan proposal that would create a long-term,
stable funding mechanism for the Highway Trust Fund. For more

Hollow Threats of Tougher U.S.
Sanctions on Russia Resemble Administrations Red Line in
Syria
At a hearing to examine developments in Ukraine,
Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on
Wednesday said the hollow threats of tougher U.S. sanctions against
Russia resemble the Obama administrations decision not to enforce a
red line in Syria after the Assad regime used chemical
weapons.
I really feel like the sanctions threats have been very
hollow.[and] have some of the same characteristics of the red
linein Syria, and I certainly hope that changes soon, said Corker. I
worry thatwere going to have a bitter peace with Russiawhere, in
essence, we sweep under the rug the actions that have taken place in Crimea
and continue to take place in Eastern Ukraine, and we basically get
back to business as usualwhich over time could lead to some more major
consequences in eastern Europe and the world, added
Corker.
He also warned of the damage to U.S. credibility when the
administration is unwilling to back up its words with action, not only in
Ukraine, but throughout the world.
I think our country
acting like such a paper tiger to the world on this and so many other
fronts is doing incredible long-term damage to our nation, and I do hope
at some point the administration will actually follow through on the
things it continues to tout publicly, said Corker.
Senator
Corker
introduced
legislation in April as a
strategic response to Russian aggression in Europe that would strengthen
the NATO alliance, impose tough sanctions to deter further Russian
aggression, and provide support to non-NATO partners of Ukraine, Moldova
and Georgia.
Hobby Lobby Ruling
Senator Corker
recently issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Courts
decision in the Hobby Lobby case:
This Supreme Court ruling
affirms the government cannot disregard the freedom of religion and force
private business owners to ignore the core tenets of their beliefs,
said Corker.
In 2012, Corker cosponsored The Respect for
Rights of Conscience Act, legislation introduced by Senator Roy Blunt
(R-Mo.) that would ensure no mandate in the health care law would
force anyone to violate their religious beliefs.
