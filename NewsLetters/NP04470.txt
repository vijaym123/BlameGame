Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Veterans are our heroes. As Americans, we will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude we owe to the men and women who have selflessly risked their lives to protect our heritage and liberty. This week, it was my privilege to participate in several local Veterans Day ceremonies, parades, and patriotic events. I was grateful to publically thank those who have served our country in the Armed Forces and honor them for their sacrifices.
Some of the Veterans Day events I participated in this week included:
-	Grande Lakes Orlandos 4th Annual Veterans Day Event
-	Mt. Dora Christian Home and Bible Parade and Veterans Day Celebration
-	Coachwood Colony Mobile Home Park Veterans Day Celebration in Leesburg
-	Veterans Club of Pennbrooke Fairways Memorial Dedication in Leesburg
-	Sea of Flags Dedication at the First Presbyterian Church of Haines City
-	Trilogy Orlando Veterans Association neighborhood event in Groveland

On Monday morning, it was my pleasure to read children's books at UCP's Book Buds program in Winter Garden. It was great to visit several of the classrooms, meet the teachers and read to the students as they learn about fall and the changing seasons. UCP (United Cerebral Palsy) classrooms integrate students with physical and learning disabilities into their teaching programs in order to help cultivate independence and provide them with full life and learning experiences.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Winter Haven contacted my office regarding a lapse in his Social Security Insurance (SSI) benefits. Although the constituent had been receiving his monthly SSI benefits by direct deposit, one month it failed to come through to his account. The constituent contacted the Social Security Administration (SSA) and was informed that an error had occurred and that his check would be resent in 10 days. When the payment failed to show up, he contacted my office. My staff reached out to SSA, who took additional action to replace the missing payment, and a direct deposit was processed to his account.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
In 2008, TransCanada, a North American energy infrastructure company, filed an application to the U.S. Department of State, submitting a permit request to build the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport a daily supply of thousands of barrels of North American oil from across the Canadian border down to Gulf Coast refineries.
Despite the potential for immense economic benefits, thousands of new jobs, increased availability of local energy reserves, and multiple assurances of a limited environmental impact, President Obama has refused to sign off on this critical infrastructure project. It has been a frustrating six years.
This week, I voted for H.R. 5682, which passed with bipartisan support, and authorizes the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline. It is past time to stop the excuses, delays, and denials, and approve the pipeline.
