David --
Last week, Speaker Boehner dispatched his TOP deputy to Illinois.
His goal? Raise big bucks for ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling, running against my good friend, Cheri Bustos.
David, if you thought Cheri had this election in the bag, think again.
Speaker Boehner won&rsquo;t give up without a fight -- and if we&rsquo;re going to protect Illinois&rsquo; 17th district, we&rsquo;ve got to be prepared. So I&rsquo;m asking a quick favor:
Can you chip in $5 or more to Cheri&rsquo;s Democratic campaign before tonight&rsquo;s midnight deadline? I&rsquo;d really appreciate it. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I&rsquo;m proud to work alongside Cheri in Congress, fighting each and every day for the hardworking people of Illinois.
But Boehner&rsquo;s just getting started, and we have to be ready.
Will you donate to Cheri&rsquo;s campaign to help her fight back? http://action.cheribustos.com/Fight-For-Cheri
