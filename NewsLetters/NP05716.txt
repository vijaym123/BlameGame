Tropical Storm 19W is making a beeline for the populated areas of the Northern Mariana Islands and is expected to intensify and become a typhoon. As always when a storm threatens, your congressional office has made direct contact with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure that everything is in readiness to respond. We can report that FEMA Region 9 personnel has deployed to the Marianas and will be on site on Saturday. The FEMA warehouse on Guam, where emergency supplies are stored, is ready and FEMAs logistics sections in Region 9 and in Washington, DC are prepared to send additional resources from Hawaii or California warehouses, if needed. In the meantime, we should all monitor the storm closely. Please be prepared, listen to local advisories, and stay out of harms way.
Improved screening is a first-line defense against diabetes
Diabetes care has improved steadily over the years, but so has evidence that intensive care has its own health risks. This points to the need for more effective screening so that persons in a pre-diabetic condition can make lifestyle changes or receive drugs that prevent or delay the full blown disease. For that reason, as a member of the House Diabetes Caucus I joined with 61 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sally Burwell, calling for broader screening guidelines . Right now, screening is only recommended for persons with hypertension. We think the federal guidelines should recommend screening for other risk factors, including age, being a member of a high-risk ethnic population, or having a first-degree relative with diabetes. This would be consistent with the recommendation of the American Diabetes Association. According to the CNMI Department of Public Health, one out of every two children born in the our islands after the year 2000 is at risk of developing type II diabetes. We must do everything we can to help head off this disease.

Rotas 300 recipients of federal food assistance got a 62 percent increase in benefits in May. A family of four went from $444 per month to $719, a significant change. Getting increased benefits for Rota, Tinian, and the Northern Islands earlier this year was the result of repeatedly explaining to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that food costs more on those islands. We are still working for a Saipan increase. I spoke with recipients on Rota this week about these issues and about the additional $30.5 million in benefit money from the Agricultural Act of 2014, Public Law 113-79, that becomes available one year from now. That new money will lift benefits to the U.S. level
one of my long-standing goals.
How much Social Security do you have to look forward to?
Not everyone in the Northern Mariana Islands
or elsewhere in America
has access to the internet. So the Social Security Administration has decided to begin mailing hard-copies of Social Security Statements to those who do not have an online Social Security account. If you are reading the e-kilili, you obviously have an internet connection, but you may not have set up a secure my Social Security account that allows you to look at your statement online whenever you want. The statement is a valuable financial planning tool that gives you a record of your tax contributions and yearly earnings and estimates your future benefit. You can set up a my Social Security account here. myaccount> And, if you decide not to, Social Security will be mailing you a hard-copy statement every five years, when you reach age 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60. After age 60, you will receive a statement every year.

FWS seeks public comment to protect 17 species in the NMI
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is inviting the public to submit comments on its proposal
to protect 17 new plant and animal species in the Northern Mariana Islands under the Endangered Species Act. Currently, our islands are home to 15 endangered or threatened species, including the Mariana crow, the Nightingale Reed Warbler, and the Mariana Fruit Bat. Comments can be submitted electronically at http://www.regulations.gov . Or you can submit comments in writing to: Public Comments Processing, Attn: FWS-R1-ES-2014-0038; Division of Policy and Directives Management; U.S. Fish & Wildlife Headquarters, MS: BPHC, 5275 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3803. Comments are being accepted until December 1.

President announces climate change competition
Climate change is a real threat for those of us living in the Pacific Islands. Rising sea levels that erode beaches, ocean acidification that eats away coral reefs, and changes in rainfall and storm intensity all endanger our island way of life. To combat these and other results of climate change, President Obama announced a new Climate Action Champions competition
this week. As many as 15 local or tribal governments will be recognized for their efforts to cut carbon pollution or prepare for the impacts of a changing climate. In addition, the designated Champions will receive technical assistance from the federal government to bolster their work. The deadline to apply is October 27.

Your DC congressional office is participating in the 2014 Fall Semester of the Congressional Internship Program for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (CIPIID). A part of the George Mason University curriculum, the Mason Life Program is an innovative post-secondary program for young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who desire a university experience in a supportive academic environment. The House of Representatives partners with Mason Life to give George Mason students with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to intern in a real-work environment.
Our intern, Adrienne Neher started with us in August and comes in every Monday until the program ends December 5th. She has a great sense of humor, is a fast learner and is always eager to tackle any assignment given her. She comes to us with a long list of volunteer experience and we are so pleased to have her with us this Fall.
We asked Adrienne to work on a write-up describing herself. Here she is, in her own words:
Hi my name Adrienne!
I go to George Mason University. I am a second year student. I live on campus but I am from Bethesda, MD. I have 2 parents, 2 sisters, 2 cats, and 1 fish. I love cats and 2 types of dogs. I like Pugs and Golden Retrievers. After college I want to get a job as a vets assistant. I am so much fun and I am crazy like a monkey!!
Welcome aboard, Adrienne.
