Economy Still Sputters Along
The
Commerce Departments
report
that retail sales in
July were flat is further evidence of the ongoing weakness in the
economy.
The House has passed 40 bills that would create jobs and
opportunities for Americans
and would get the economy moving
again.
Those bills continue to sit in the Senates in box, gathering
dust. It is long past time for the Senate to act on these bills and get
America moving again.
Back in
Iraq
After removing all U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, President Obama
has reintroduced the American military into Iraq in an effort to prevent
genocide against Christians, Kurds, and other Iraqis who refuse to
bow to the demands of ISIL
the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant.
Speaker Boehners
statement
is
well worth a read, as is this
piece
in the
Wall Street Journal ,
The Third Iraq
War.
America Needs a Coherent Foreign
Policy
American leadership is indispensible to peace and stability
around the world. The lack of a clear,
coherent
American foreign policy is encouraging the violence and volatility that
is breaking out across the globe.
The Kurds
Need Our Help
The Kurds have long been strong
allies of the United States. That friendship is making them a prime target
of ISIL, which is seeking to eliminate anyone who does not recognize
ISILs control and its efforts to create a caliphate in the region.
This excellent
Washington Post
editorial
explains why the Kurds deserve Americas
help.
Lament of a Legal Alien
Wall Street
Journal
As the discussion about illegal immigration
continues, it is worth remembering that every year one million people
come to the United States legally, as this compelling
article
by Dr. Manmeet Singh reminds
us.
Libya: The Next Terrorist Stronghold?
Three
years after U.S. and NATO forces helped liberate Libya from the
dictatorship of Moammar Gaddafi, the country is beginning to look a lot like
another nation where an abrupt U.S. disengagement following a civil war
led to chaos: Afghanistan in the 1990s. Those sobering words open a
Washington Post
editorial
that criticizes that the Obama Administrations decision to
walk away from Libya after helping to overthrow Gaddafi.
We
all know what happened after Afghanistan fell apart in the 1990s: al
Qaeda used it as the base from which it organized and launched the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We need to ensure that history
does not repeat itself.
What Really Happened in
Iran:
Foreign Affairs
This fascinating
essay
debunks the long-held myth that the CIA was
responsible for overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran
in 1953 and installing the Shah back on the Peacock Throne.
Understanding this history is important to understand current events in Iran.
Its a lengthy piece, but well worth the time
invested.
Salute: Jon R. Cavaiani, Medal of Honor
Recipient
Jon R. Cavaiani, who
received
the highest
military order for valor, the Medal of Honor, died recently in
California. A Vietnam combat veteran, the story of his extraordinary bravery is
both inspiring and a reminder of the debt we owe each man and woman,
all volunteers, who serve our country in the Armed Forces of the
United States, protecting our country and our freedom.
