Friends,
As you know, taxes were due this week. If you're like me, you were reminded that hard-working Americans are overtaxed to pay for non-essential and wasteful government programs.
We need a simpler, flatter and fairer tax code.
That's what I co-sponsored legislation to replace our current tax system with the FairTax.
Under that plan, the income tax, employment tax and the estate tax would be repealed and replaced by a simple, national sales tax. This system means
you get your whole paycheck , rather than the government raiding it first.
Death and Taxes
While we work on moving a comprehensive tax reform bill through Congress, House Republicans are also working to do away with some of the worst elements of our current tax code. Accordingly, I voted this week to repeal the estate tax, as known as the death tax.
Liberals in Washington want to tax every event in life, including death. They view the death of certain people as a pay day for their big government programs. But make no mistake: the death tax is unfair, insensitive to grieving families and punishes hard work. Its also particularly brutal for families that own farms, as the land and equipment necessary for farming can quickly exceed the exempted amount, causing this devastating tax to be levied on the next generation. Its past time to repeal this unacceptable tax. Every American deserves the ability to pass their lifes savings to their kids.

U.S. House passes estate tax repeal despite veto threat
Conservatives, who refer to the estate tax as the "death tax," have long railed against it, arguing it hurts the families of small business owners and farmers.
"Its past time to repeal this unacceptable tax. Every American deserves the ability to pass their lifes savings to their kids," said Representative Tom Graves, a conservative Republican from Georgia.
