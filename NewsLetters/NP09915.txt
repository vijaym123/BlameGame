Dear David,
In order to kickstart our slow-but-steady
economic recovery, we must attack on multiple fronts. We know that
America must create quality jobs while protecting the ones we already
have. A third part of this strategy that is not talked about or focused on
nearly enough must be to bring back those jobs
specifically in the
manufacturing sector
that we lost during the Great
Recession.
The 2000s were a lost decade for American
manufacturing. We lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs during this
time period, accounting for nearly six million jobs.
Instead of
shipping quality American goods overseas, we rewarded companies that
shipped jobs overseas by offering them a tax break. In addition, foreign
governments offered these same companies tax breaks and cheap labor. It
is critical, now more than ever, that we work together to reverse
that trend by investing in public private partnerships.
It is
time to once again Make It In
America.
Promoting American goods takes more than looking for labels that
say Made in America. It takes a commitment from our leaders;
commitments that show the world we are serious about once again harnessing
that uniquely American ingenuity and innovative spirit. That means
working
with
our manufacturers instead of merely getting out of
their way.
At a time when our global
competitors are investing more and more, we cannot cut support of the
manufacturing sector and still reap rewards. Offshoring jobs at the level we
saw in recent years hurts supplier networks and makes us less
competitive as a nation. A poor supply chain hurts the next generation and
stifles future efforts to boost American
manufacturing.
A comprehensive Make It In America agenda is the
foundation for ensuring a strong middle class and offering opportunities for
those seeking to enter it. A strong middle-class is critical to ensuring
we become the kingpin in the global economic race. That is why I am
pushing an aggressive agenda to support American manufacturing, bring
back those jobs we lost, and put New Yorkers back to
work.
You can read more about our
Make It In America agenda here . If you have any questions
or comments
or if my office can be of assistance in any way
please dont hesitate to call. My door is always open.
