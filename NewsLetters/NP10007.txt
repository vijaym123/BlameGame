Dear Friend,
In my fifteen months in Congress, if there's
been one word I've heard with notable frequency, it's been
"Benghazi."
Not from TV news. Not from other Members of
Congress.
I've heard it from you, your neighbors--my
constituents.
This evening, I want to make sure you're up to speed on
two very important developments in the investigation into what really
happened on September 11, 2012.
Earlier today,
the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena to Secretary of State John
Kerry
to testify
before the committee about e-mails that have been witheld from our
investigation for more than 19 months. This subpoena comes just a day
after Brigadier General Robert Lovell testified that the State Department
never asked the military to assist the Americans who ultimately died
in the attack in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.
With
these developments, House Republican leadership announced that
the House will vote to
form a select committee
whose purpose will be to
dedicate all of its efforts to this investigation.
I'm a cosponsor
of the resolution seeking this committee, and I look forward to the
coming vote to make the Select Committee on Benghazi a
reality.
I share your questions and your concerns over how 4 brave Americans
could die in such a brutal way. I want today's developments to assure
you that we're holding the Administration accountable for what
happened in every possible way.
I continue to welcome
your thoughts
on
this.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
