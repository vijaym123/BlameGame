Omnibus Delivers Responsible IRS Policy to Taxpayers
As Chairman of the House Financial Services and General Government
Appropriations Subcommittee, I helped draft the fiscal year 2014
Omnibus Appropriations Act
- legislation that delivers responsible
Internal Revenue Service policy to American taxpayers.
This week, I was asked by USA Today to defend Congress's approach
regarding funding the IRS in the Omnibus. I thought you would be
interested in reading the article I wrote for the paper's Thursday
editorial page. The full text printed is below.
Rep. Crenshaw: Hold IRS accountable
Americans need a tax administration free of ideological or political
bias.
Story Highlights
After more than a decade of steady increases, IRS appropriations
peaked in 2010.
The same year it began targeting non-profits based on name, not
activity.
And the same year it held lavish conferences and made expensive
videos.
Given the IRS' recent history of targeting Americans who hold certain
political beliefs and wasting millions of dollars on lavish conferences
and videos, we can all agree this agency needs to be held accountable
for its treatment of taxpayers and the money they send to Washington.
The 2014 Omnibus Appropriations Act takes a long stride toward this
goal by requiring numerous, frequent and extensive reports from the IRS
about its spending on training, bonuses, information technology and
operations. It also expressly prohibits the IRS from targeting persons
for their ideological beliefs and from interfering with First Amendment
rights.
The IRS can repair its breach of public trust by devotion to a mission
of tax administration free of ideological or political bias. Keeping
the agency's budget nearly flat will make it think twice before
straying off course. There's not a penny to spare.
After more than a decade of steady increases, IRS appropriations peaked
in 2010 - the same year it began targeting non-profits based on name,
not activity, and the same year it held lavish conferences and made
expensive videos. When awash in money, the IRS has moved toward
harassment and horseplay, not responsible customer service.
Critics of the omnibus bill argue that increasing the IRS' funding
boosts revenue and decreases the deficit. Yet, facts do not bear this
out. In 2013, while the IRS was living with sequestration reductions,
total collections reached an all-time high.
Nonetheless, we need the IRS to enforce tax laws, stop and prevent
fraud, prepare forms and instructions, process refunds, collect revenue
and assist taxpayers in complying with tax obligations. The omnibus
bill provides an additional $92 million to improve taxpayer service,
address identity theft and combat fraud.
The appropriations process is about making choices when funding is
limited. As chairman of the subcommittee that oversees IRS funding, I
am proud of my panel's work. We are now pointed in a direction that
respects American taxpayers. They deserve responsible fiscal policy
from Washington. The omnibus delivers it, and not a moment too soon.

As
Chairman
of
the
House
Financial
Services
and
General
Government
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
helped
draft the
fiscal
year
2014
Omnibus
Appropriations
Act
-
legislation that
delivers
responsible
Internal
Revenue
Service
policy
to
American
taxpayers.
This
week,
I
was
asked
by
USA
Today
to
defend
Congress&#8217;s
approach
regarding
funding
the
IRS
in
the
Omnibus.
I
thought
you
would
be
interested
in
reading
the
article
I
wrote
for the

The
full
text
printed is

Rep.

&#8226; After

Given
the

recent
history
of
targeting
Americans
who
hold
certain
political

and
wasting
millions
of
dollars
on
lavish

we
can
all
agree
this
agency
needs
to
be
held
accountable
for
