This past election, Republican outside groups spent hundreds-of-millions of dollars to silence our voices and bring their hand-picked candidates to Congress.
In a post- Citizens United
era, outside groups can pour virtually unfettered cash into elections -- damaging our democracy as we know it.
David, we can&rsquo;t sit by and watch this continue to happen. So if you&rsquo;re with us, we need to hear from you right now.
Please sign our petition to end
Citizens United. Supporter: David Johnson
