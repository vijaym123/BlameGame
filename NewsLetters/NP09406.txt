Wanted to share with you a
recent article
in the Washington Post, acknowledging the difficulty in determining whether or not plans sold on health insurance marketplaces cover abortion. For people of faith, this lack of clarity poses the grave problem of potentially being forced to violate their religious convictions.
While Virginia has prohibited abortion coverage in the state exchange, the issue is both real and relevant across our nation, and should deeply concern all of us who believe life is precious and deserves to be protected. That is why I supported the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, ( H.R. 7 ),
which makes permanent restrictions on the federal funding of abortions.
It also incorporates provisions of the Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act ( H.R. 3279 ), which I cosponsored, to provide full disclosure and transparency of abortion coverage to consumers who are shopping for health insurance plans on the exchanges. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 227 to 188.
Yours in service,
Randy
