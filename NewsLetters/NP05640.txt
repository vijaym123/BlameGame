Last week the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee held a hearing with now-former Secret Service Director Julia Pierson
about recent lapses in security at the White House.

to watch questioning of Ms. Pierson.
Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned shortly after
the hearing, but these security breaches need to be addressed and deserve
further investigation. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have
called for a comprehensive and independent review of the Secret Service.
With the news of confirmed cases in the Upstate of
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a
virus
that has sickened children around the country,
we wanted to pass along some information to help
keep your family safe.
This information is courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
What are the symptoms of EV-D68 infection?
EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness.
Mild
symptoms may include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, and body and muscle
aches.
Severe symptoms may include wheezing and
difficulty breathing. See
EV-D68
in the U.S., 2014
for details about infections occurring this
year.
How does the
virus spread?
Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the
virus can be found in an infected persons respiratory secretions, such as
saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum. EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person when
an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface that is then touched
by others.
Who is at risk?
In
general, infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with
enteroviruses and become ill. That's because they do not yet have immunity
(protection) from previous exposures to these viruses. We believe this is also
true for EV-D68. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more
likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms.
Children with asthma may have a higher risk for
severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection.
What should I do if I think my child has EV-D68 ?
If you suspect your
child has EV-D68 you should seek the help of your primary care provider. For
