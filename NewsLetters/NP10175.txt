WASHINGTON, DC -
House Speaker John Boehner
(R-OH) announced today that the House will move forward with plans to vote
on creating a select committee to investigate the attacks in Benghazi
on September 11, 2012. These terrorist attacks in Libya killed four
Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens.Congressman Doug Lamborn
released the following statement:
"It
is
outrageous
that the Administration
has
been
deliberately
withholding
documents that were subpoenaed by the House
and has not
taken this investigation
or the death of four
Americans
seriously. Recent documents show an egregious
cover-up of the Benghazi attacks
going
all
the way to top officials at the White House. I join many of my
colleagues in thanking Speaker Boehner for moving forward with this
investigation
and have long supported
the
creation of a
select committee. I hope that this select
committee will bring necessary closure to those impacted by these Islamist
extremists
and finally provide answers
to
the American people.
Congressman
Lamborn is a cosponsor of H.Res. 36, the resolution to establish a select
committee on Benghazi, which will be voted on in the near
future.
