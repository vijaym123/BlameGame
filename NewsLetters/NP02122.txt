face to face at community coffees
Since taking office, I've hosted meetings throughout Southwest Washington for residents to come and speak their mind, ask questions and share ideas.
This week, I hosted three public meetings in Vancouver, Camas, and Longview. Thank you to the many folks who took the time to come out. There were great questions, comments, and lively discussions.
Would you like to join me at my next "community coffee"?
These events are free and open to the public and more information is available
on my website.

Oscar B. Ferry, Welcome!
I'm thrilled to be in Wahkiakum County this afternoon to help celebrate the arrival of the Oscar B. Ferry. The operation of commencement ceremony will be at the ferry landing in Cathlamet.
It was my honor to work with Senator Patty Murray, Wahkiakum County, and the Army Corps of Engineers to help navigate the complex permitting process and make sure it was completed before the deadline.
