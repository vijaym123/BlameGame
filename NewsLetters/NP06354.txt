Dear Friend, All the polls and all the models give the GOP better-than-even odds of taking over the Senate this November.
The
New York Times &rsquo; Upshot is predicting that on November 5, the makeup of the Senate will look like this:
Republicans - 52; Democrats - 48 . Also known as a GOP majority. If that happens, they&rsquo;ll control both houses of Congress. And if they can take both houses of Congress, they&rsquo;ve already promised us more government shutdowns, more inaction on climate change, and an end to Medicare as we know it. If the Republicans think they can pick up a Senate seat in Massachusetts, they&rsquo;ll have to go through me first. Give $5 before the FEC deadline to help me keep fighting.

I&rsquo;ve spent my entire career building up and protecting the programs that Republicans want to slash or eliminate altogether. And we cannot let all of that hard work get tossed aside by the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party that is more focused on ending government than having it work for the American people.
Only a few short years ago -- before the rise of the Tea Party -- there were reasonable Republicans. People who knew the value of compromise. People who put the interests of others ahead of their own political careers. But this batch of Tea Party Republicans wants to undo all the hard work we&rsquo;ve done. We can&rsquo;t let that happen -- contribute $5 today, and help us reach our $145,000 goal.
Thank you.
