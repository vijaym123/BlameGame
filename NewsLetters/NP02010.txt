Standing up for American Manufacturing Jobs in Trade Policy
Jeff believes that our test for trade policy should be whether a trade
deal creates good-paying American jobs, or destroys them.
Too many of our past trade deals cost American jobs and held down
American wages. That's why Jeff recently introduced legislation that
would require any new trade deals to take on the hidden, unfair
subsidies - like sub-standard worker safety, wage, and environmental
standards - that tilt the playing field against American manufacturing
and cost American jobs.
On Friday, he visited the shuttered Blue Heron paper mill in Oregon
City with workers who lost their jobs to highlight the real-life
impacts of trade policy gone wrong - and the critical importance of
getting it right.

A Big Victory for Consumers on Medical Debt
Last week brought good news for consumers, with the three big
credit-reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, agreeing
to major changes in how medical debt is counted on your credit score.
Jeff has been a champion of changing this broken system, which has led
to many Americans being denied credit or charged subprime interest
rates on home loans, car loans, or credit cards due to medical debt -
often small debts they didn't even know they had until they went to
apply for credit.
Medical debt is different from other types of debt. No one makes a
choice to incur debt from being in an accident or suddenly falling ill.
Moreover, complicated billing systems and insurance company
bureaucracies mean that consumers often don't learn they owe money
until after a debt has already been sent to collections. Now,
credit-reporting agencies will have to wait 180 days before medical
debt is added to a credit report - and to take it off promptly once it
has been paid. These changes will make the system more accurate for
creditors and fairer for consumers: a win- win.
Welcome Home, Stacey!
In September, Oregonian veterinarian Stacey Addison was traveling the
world when she was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Another
passenger in a shared cab stopped to pick up a package that turned out
to be drugs, and Stacey soon found herself in a prison in East Timor.
Jeff brought the case to the attention of the State Department and
worked with American diplomats and the East Timorese government to get
Stacey out of prison and safely home. The United States' ability to
represent Stacey in East Timor was hampered by not having an
ambassador, so he worked in the Senate to get an ambassador confirmed.
Working with the new ambassador, Jeff was able to help secure Stacey's
release from prison on Christmas Day, and then earlier this month to
get her passport returned so she could come home. He was thrilled that
on March 2, she was finally able to leave East Timor and come home
safely to Oregon.

A Budget that Works for Working Americans?
Or a Budget for the Best
Off?
This week, Senate Republicans will reveal their proposed budget for
2016. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, Jeff will evaluate
their budget proposal with a very simple question: Is it a budget that
works for working Americans? Or is it a budget for the best off?
Jeff's number one priority is pushing for policies that will grow and
support America's middle class, and that means a budget that matches
our values and priorities. A successful budget should invest in good
jobs, in repairing our roads and bridges, and in making education
higher quality and more affordable from pre-K through college and
beyond. It should invest in fiscal responsibility by closing wasteful
tax loopholes and requiring the wealthiest to pay their fair share. And
it should champion middle- class retirement security, protecting Social
Security and Medicare from the harmful impacts of privatization,
"voucher-ization," or cuts to the benefits Oregonians have earned
through their hard work.
As the budget debate moves forward, Jeff will keep pushing for
responsible budget policies that stand up for our middle class.
