About Tim

Dear Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter! It's a privilege to serve
you and all of South Carolina. Here are some of the issues I've been
working on this week:
Obamacare Train wreck
It's clear by now that Obamacare is a disaster that is resulting in
cancelled insurance plans and higher premiums for people across South
Carolina and the United States. I spoke on the Senate floor this week
about the Geigers, a family from Charleston who may have to decide
between saving for their childrens' education and paying double-digit
increases in their healthcare premiums thanks to Obamacare. We simply
shouldn't be asking our families to make that choice.

We've also learned that 150,000 people
in South
Carolina alone have had their health insurance cancelled because of
Obamacare. Yesterday, the president announced a "fix" that hardly fixes
the problem at all - it merely delays the train wreck that's coming.
The president's repeated promises that "if you like your plan, you can
keep your plan" simply weren't true, and there's no way for him to get
around it.
It's time to repeal Obamacare and replace it with healthcare reform
that lowers costs, increases access to quality care, and doesn't harm
our economy and our families.
Standing Up for Innocent Lives
I recently signed on to co-sponsor legislation that stands up for those
who can't stand up for themselves - unborn children.
The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act restricts abortion at 20
weeks - the point at which scientific evidence shows an unborn child
can experience pain and suffering.
Life is the most precious gift one can receive. I strongly support this
legislation.
Flood Insurance
I have also joined a bipartisan effort to delay flood insurance premium
hikes until we reform our flood insurance system in a way that makes it
more affordable and more sustainable. The Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act will require FEMA to complete an affordability study,
propose solutions to address affordability issues, and certify that
their mapping process is accurate before any flood insurance premiums
can be raised in the future.
Unfortunately, our current system makes it harder for folks to play by
the rules. A temporary delay will allow for a halt in burdensome rate
increases while the problem is addressed.
Accepting Internship Applications
My offices are looking for interns for the spring and summer! We are
accepting applications from South Carolinians interested in serving in
our Upstate, Midlands, Lowcountry, and Washington, D.C. offices.
These internships will provide an educational opportunity for college
students who would like to learn first-hand about our government, the
legislative process, and what it's like to work in a fast-paced Senate
office.
Internships are open primarily to college juniors and seniors. If you'd
like to join our team and serve our state and our country, contact the
internship coordinator at internships@scott.senate.gov
or (202) 224-6121).
God Bless,
Tim

Dear
Friends,
Thank
you
for
subscribing
to
my
e-newsletter!
It&#8217;s
a
privilege
to
serve
you
and
all
of
South
Carolina.
Here
are
some
of
the
issues
I&#8217;ve
been
working
on
this
week:
Obamacare
Train
wreck
It&#8217;s
clear
by
now
that
Obamacare
is
a
disaster
that
is
resulting
in
cancelled
insurance
plans
and
higher
premiums
for
people
across
South
Carolina
and
the
United
States.
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
floor
this
week
about
the
Geigers,
a
family
from
Charleston
who
may
have
to
decide
between
saving
for
their
childrens&#8217;
education
and
paying
double-digit
increases
in
their
healthcare
premiums
thanks
to
Obamacare.
We
simply
shouldn&#8217;t
be
asking
our
families

We&#8217;ve
also

that
150,000
people
in
South
Carolina
alone
have
had
their
health
insurance
cancelled
because
of
Obamacare.
Yesterday,
the
president
announced
a
&#8220;fix&#8221;
that
hardly
fixes
the
problem
at
all
&#8211;
it
merely
delays
the
train
wreck
that&#8217;s
coming.
The
president&#8217;s
repeated
promises
that
&#8220;if
you
like
your
plan,
you
can
keep
your
plan&#8221;
simply
weren&#8217;t
true,
and
there&#8217;s
no
way
for
him
to
get
around
it.
It&#8217;s
time
to
repeal
Obamacare
and
replace
it
with
healthcare
reform
that
lowers
costs,
increases
access
to
quality
care,
and
doesn&#8217;t

economy
and
our
families.
Standing
Up
for
Innocent
Lives
I
recently
signed
on
to
co-sponsor
legislation
that
stands
up
for
those
who
can&#8217;t
stand
up
for
themselves
&#8211;
unborn
children.
The
Pain
Capable
Unborn
Child
Protection
Act
restricts
abortion
at
20
weeks
&#8211;
the
point
at
which
scientific
evidence
shows
an
unborn
child
can
experience
pain
and
suffering.
Life
is
the
most
precious
gift
one
can
receive.
I
strongly
support
this
legislation.
Flood
Insurance
I
have
also
joined
a
bipartisan
effort
to
delay
flood
insurance
premium
hikes
until
we
reform
our
flood
insurance
system
in
a
way
that
makes
it
more
affordable
and
more
sustainable.
The
Homeowner
Flood
Insurance
Affordability
Act
will
require
FEMA
to
complete
an
affordability
study,
propose
solutions
to
address
affordability
issues,
and
certify
that
their
mapping
process
is
accurate
before
any
flood
insurance
premiums
can
be
raised
in
the
future.
Unfortunately,
our
current
system
makes
it
harder
for
folks
to
play
by
the
rules.
A
temporary
delay
will
allow
for
a
halt
in
burdensome
rate
increases
while
the
problem
is
addressed.
