Dear David,
As a Member of Congress, one of my most important duties is keeping
my constituents informed about my work on behalf of the residents of
California's 26th Congressional District. However, we are soon
entering the pre-primary "blackout period" between March 5, 2014 and June 3,
2014. During these three months, House rules only allow me to send
these updates to constituents who have "opted in."
"Opting in"
is easy! Simply visit
my website
or click the
link below. I hope to be able to continue to update you on legislation
pending before Congress and issues that are important to Ventura
County. It is with your thoughts and comments that I can continue to best
advocate for our community.
Click

and enter your email address to receive periodic email updates about
how I am working to move Ventura County forward.
It is
an honor to serve as your voice in Congress.
Sincerely,
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of
Congress
