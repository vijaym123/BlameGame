Dear Neighbors,
Here is an update on some items I am working on in Congress. From
Benghazi to the IRS and Russia's invasion into Crimea, here's the
latest:
Benghazi
Last week, Speaker of the House, John Boehner, announced that a special
committee to further investigate Benghazi will be created. This came
after newly discovered emails from top White House officials explicitly
illustrated the Administration's plan to carefully control the message
in the days after the Benghazi attack-whether or not it was the truth.
The talking points crafted a story that the Benghazi attack was the
result of a protest stemming from an obscure Youtube video rather than
administration error. We now know that was not the truth.
Administration officials did not want to project weakness in the war on
terror with the Presidential election just weeks away. Since then, this
Administration has withheld the facts from Congress at every turn.
The
questions is WHY?
There has been no accountability in this Administration, often blaming
lower level operatives. This stonewalling of getting all the evidence
to the American public has gone on for too long. I applaud Speaker
Boehner's decision to create a Special Committee to investigate
Benghazi. Finally, we are taking the necessary steps to figure out
exactly what happened on September 11, 2012, bringing justice to the
victims' families, holding the killers accountable and providing
answers for the American people.
IRS's Unlawful Targeting
On the House floor this week, the House voted in support of 2 measures
that will help bring accountability to IRS's unlawful targeting of
conservative and other organizations:
(1) The House voted to hold Lois Lerner, a former IRS official, in
contempt of Congress after she repeatedly refused to answer questions
regarding the IRS's targeting of conservative and other organizations.
(2) The House voted to call upon Attorney General Eric Holder to
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS's actions.
In 2012, several groups from Houston contacted me, letting me know they
received invasive and expansive requests from the IRS. To initiate
investigations, I brought their allegations to three Congressional
Committees. We later learned that their allegations were proven true
after the IRS admitted to its unlawful actions. There is yet another
example of this Administration blaming lower level operatives and no
one being held accountable. These two bills will help move the
investigations forward. Private citizens should never be punished for
questioning the government; this is America, not a third world
dictatorship.
Ukraine
Two weeks ago, I traveled to Ukraine. It was a sobering experience as I
saw firsthand the situation on the ground. Our country must do more to
let our friends in the Ukraine know that we support them and want to
help protect their democratic freedoms. I met with Ukrainian officials
and presidential candidates to discuss the unrest in the region,
Russia's propaganda campaign and the citizens' fears their safety.

Putin is on a mission to restore the former Soviet Union. He is even
called parts of Ukraine the "New Russia." The U.S. must ratchet up its
sanctions against Russia to hurt it economically while expediting U.S.
natural gas exports to Ukraine and other former Soviet territories. I
have introduced legislation to do just that. The Fight Russian Energy
Exploitation (FREE) Act would require the Department of Energy to
expedite and approve any permits for natural gas exports to Ukraine,
all former Soviet nations and all members of the European Union. I also
introduced the Russia Visa Sanctions Act, which would withhold all
visas -both official and tourist- for all Russian government officials
until the Secretary of State certifies that all Russian military
activity has ceased in Ukraine. If there is one thing we know for sure
about Putin, it's that he only responds to strength. The U.S. must
project strength and leadership through economic sanctions and energy
exports to combat Putin's aggressive imperialist behavior.

Dear
Neighbors,
Here
is
an
update
on
some
items
I
am
working
on
in
Congress.
From
Benghazi
to
the
IRS
and
Russia&#8217;s
invasion
into
Crimea,
here&#8217;s
the
latest:
Benghazi
Last
week,
Speaker
of
the
House,
John
Boehner,
announced
that
a
special
committee
to
further
investigate
Benghazi
will
be
created.

Benghazi
attack-whether
or

it
was

The
talking
points
crafted
a
story
that
the
Benghazi
attack
was
the
result
of
a
protest
stemming
from
an
obscure
Youtube
video
rather
than
administration
error.
We
now
know
that
was
not
the
truth.
Administration
officials
did
not
want
to
project
weakness
in
the
war
on
terror
with
the
Presidential
election
just
weeks
away.
Since
then,
this
Administration
has
withheld
the
facts from
Congress
at
every
turn.
The
questions
is
WHY?
There
has
been
no
accountability
in
this
Administration,
often
blaming
lower
level
operatives.
This
stonewalling

IRS&#8217;s
Unlawful
Targeting
On
the
House
floor
this
week,
the
House
voted
in
support
of
2
measures
that
will
help
bring
accountability
to
IRS&#8217;s
unlawful
targeting
of
conservative
and
other
organizations:
(1)
The
House
voted
to
hold
Lois
Lerner,
a
former
IRS
official,
in
contempt
of
Congress
after
she
repeatedly
refused
to
answer
questions
regarding
the
IRS&#8217;s
targeting
of
conservative
and
other
organizations.
(2)
The
House
voted
to
call
upon
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
to
appoint
a
special
prosecutor
to
investigate
the
IRS&#8217;s
actions.
In
2012,
several
groups
from
Houston
contacted
me,
letting
me
know
they
received
invasive
and
expansive
requests
from
the
IRS.
To
initiate
investigations, I
brought
their
allegations
to
three
Congressional
Committees.
We
later
learned
that
their
allegations
were
proven
true
after
the
IRS
admitted
to
its
unlawful
actions.
There
is
yet
another
example
of
this
Administration
blaming
lower
level
operatives
and
no
one
being
held
accountable.
These
two
bills
will
help
move
the
investigations
forward.
Private
citizens
should
never
be
punished
for
questioning
the
government;
this
is
America,
not
a
third
world
dictatorship.
Ukraine
Two
weeks
ago,
I
traveled
to Ukraine.
It
was
a
sobering
experience
as
I
saw firsthand
the
situation
on
the
ground. Our
country
must
do
more
to let
our
friends
in
the
Ukraine
know
that
we
support
them
and
want
to
help protect
their
democratic
freedoms. I
met
with
Ukrainian
officials and
presidential
candidates
to
discuss
the
unrest
in
the
region,
Russia's
propaganda
campaign
and
the
citizens'
fears
their
safety.

is

The
U.S.
must
ratchet
up
its sanctions
against
Russia
to
hurt
it
economically while
expediting
U.S. natural
gas exports
to
Ukraine
and
other
former
Soviet
territories.
I
have
introduced
legislation
to
do
just
that.
The

Ac t
would
require
the
Department
of
Energy
to
expedite
and
approve
any
permits
for
natural
gas
exports to
Ukraine,
all
former
Soviet
nations
and
all
members
of
the
European
Union.
I
also
introduced
the
Russia
Visa
Sanctions
Act,
which
would
withhold
all
visas
&#8212; both
official
and
tourist &#8212;
for
all
Russian
government
officials
until
the
Secretary
of State
certifies
that
all
Russian
military
activity
has
ceased
in
Ukraine.
If
there
is
one
thing
we
know
for
sure
about
Putin,
it's
that
he
only
responds
to
strength.
The
U.S.
must
project
strength
and
leadership
through
economic
sanctions
and
energy exports
to combat
Putin's
aggressive
imperialist
behavior.
