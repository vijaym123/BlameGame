Simpler, Flatter,
Fairer
The past thirty days have
certainly been busy. In late February, the Ways and Means Committee I
sit on released a
pro-growth tax reform
draft
which focuses on making the U.S. tax code,
simpler, flatter and
fairer.
Many of you filled out my
survey
and let me know what you think about the
draft. Thank you taking the time to do that. If you haven't yet chimed in,
I encourage you to visit my
website
to learn more about the draft and then
let me know what
you think
by taking my
survey .
Stopping the
IRS
The House also passed
legislation
at the end of February which will
stop the IRS
from implementing new rules which will
stifle the voices of conservative
501(c)(4)
organizations. No matter what your political beliefs are,
no
one should be silenced by their government
and I am determined
to stop the IRS from continuing this practice.
Rein in the Red Tape
We
also passed
legislation
that will
rein in the red tape
that
threatens to drown many of our small businesses, keeping them from expanding
and hiring new workers. The bill contained an amendment I introduced
which will
force regulators
to tell us what the
objectives are of any new regulations, how they're going to measure it and
then if they actually reached those objectives. It's just plain
common-sense
to know what kind of impact red tape is
going to have
before
it's
passed.
Big Government Wish
List
In early March, the President also released his
budget
(late again...)
that I believe is really just a
" Big Government Wish Li st "
-
more taxes, more spending and more
government.
In my opinion, this kind of thinking will not put our country
back on the road to recovery.
Individual liberty, limited
government and a strong national defense
is what made this
country great in the first place, but unfortunately, the White House
budget points towards less opportunity and more power for
Washington.
Fixing
Medicare
And exciting news on the Medicare front! The way
Washington pays Medicare doctors to care for our Seniors is
so
broken
that it's pushing doctors to stop
accepting Medicare patients, making it more difficult for Seniors to find a
doctor they
know and trust.
The House
passed a
bi-partisan
bill
which is a great first step to fixing this broken system. There is
still more to be done, but I'm confident
we can finish the
job . In the meantime House Republicans are
also
fighting to stop
the additional cuts
to
Medicare Advantage , which so many seniors depend upon. Stay tuned
for more information on that.
Imperial Presidency
In mid-March, the
House acted to
stop the administration
from being
able to unilaterally decide which sections of laws he enforces and
which sections he doesn't. Expecting him to faithfully enforce the
laws of the land shouldn't be a far-fetched idea -
it should
be the norm.
The
bills
we passed will give Congress the ability to hold him
accountable.
Let's Be
Fair
After another announcement
from
the White House that they were
once
again
delaying the Affordable Care Act
business mandate, requiring
businesses to provide health care for their workers, the House voted
to pass the
SIMPLE Fairness
Act . This bill will suspend the
penalty
tax
that individuals will have to pay if they choose not to, or can't
afford to buy government approved health care insurance. It just doesn't
make sense for big businesses to get a break
when
families and workers
are stuck holding the bag.
