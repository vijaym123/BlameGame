David, we were going to give it a whole day off... but this is too important:
We just learned Chris Christie is coming to Illinois to host a mega-dollar fundraiser for Bob Dold -- in SIX days.
Every dollar he raises for Dold will go directly towards viciously attacking Brad on Illinois T.V.
And with Illinois voters ALREADY casting ballots, we can&rsquo;t afford to fall behind.
There&rsquo;s 24 days left and time is running out. Rush $5 or more to help us get out the facts to voters.
David Johnson DEADLINE:
11:59 PM
