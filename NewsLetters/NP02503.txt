WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE
CONSTITUTION, AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND BY THE
CONSTITUTION
Just moments ago, I joined the U.S. House of
Representatives in approving a one-week extension for Homeland
Security funding, allowing time for House and Senate negotiators to reach
agreement on a longer-term spending plan.
The truth is, we are
committed to the Constitution, and we are going to stand by the
Constitution.

speech.
Prior to the
vote,
I helped lead the fight against a House Democrat effort to
secure funding for President Obama's unconstitutional amnesty
plan , urging my colleagues to uphold the
Constitution.
Why?
This is an issue of our Liberties and
the Balance of Power in the United States.
Even President
Obama has stated 22 times that he does not have the right to declare
amnesty.
The courts have ruled against President
Obama's amnesty plan.
The truth is,
we are
committed to the Constitution, and we are going to stand by the
Constitution .
We're not going to allow the edict of one person to
commit this country to a direction unchallenged.
We are committed
to that principle.
We believe that the rights of the American
people are founded in this Constitution, and we will submit ourselves
to that.
If you have questions about this or any other
legislation, or if you need assistance with an issue involving a federal
agency, such as Social Security, IRS, Medicare, or passports, please
don't hesitate to call, stop by my offices in Charlotte, Mooresville, or
Union County, or simply reply to this e-mail.
