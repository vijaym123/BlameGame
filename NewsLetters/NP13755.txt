Dear
friends,
This week, I participated in a Judiciary Committee hearing about the
Presidents failure to fulfill his most basic Constitution duty
to
faithfully execute the law.
In the last few months, the
President has refused to faithfully execute certain laws, including
key portions of Obamacare.
In addition, he has waived federal work
requirements for welfare and made appointments to the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) without the advice and consent of the
Senate.
This is a very serious issue because, under Article
II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President has the duty to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed. The Constitution does not
delegate legislative authority to the President to rewrite, amend, or
delay duly-enacted Constitutional laws.
Only Congress can do
that.
The President assumed legislative authority when he
delayed the employer mandate under Obamacare and extended the
grandfather clause to insurance plans not covered under the law.
He
even threatened to veto lawful statutory change proposed by the House,
even though it was the same change he instituted with his executive
decision.
In the case of the NLRB, the President made three
appointments to the Board, arguing they were recess appointments and
therefore constitutional. However, earlier this year, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia disagreed and unanimously ruled
that the appointments were unconstitutional. Even so, the President is
still working to circumvent the law.
The President has a
Constitutional responsibility to enforce all of Americas laws, not pick
and choose which ones he wishes to enforce.
This weeks
Judiciary Committee hearing brought much-needed attention to the
Presidents failure to execute the law, including his overreach of executive
authority.
I will continue to insist that the President act
within the Constitutional limits of his office and enforce the laws
passed by Congress.
I am a cosponsor of a resolution, H Res.
425, that disapproves of the Presidents failure to fulfill his
Constitutional duties and his usurpation of Congress legislative authority.
The resolution, introduced by Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) also reaffirms
the preservation of the separation of powers and its essential role in
maintaining the rule of law and protecting our individual
liberties.
George Washington once said, It is my duty to see the laws
executed: to permit them to be trampled with impunity would be
repugnant.
I agree.
We, in Congress, have an obligation
as
representatives of the people, and as members of a co-equal branch of
government
to respond to the Presidents overreach of power and
reverse it.
This is an issue that all Idahoans can unite
behind, and I will continue to be a leader in this
effort.
