Wicker Opposes EPA's Most Expensive
Regulation
Proposal to Change
Ground-Level Ozone
Standard Could Cost
Trillions
It is not surprising that the Obama Administration chose to
announce its latest environmental regulation on the eve of the
Thanksgiving holiday.
With Americans traveling and families busy
preparing meals for loved ones, there was a good chance that the costly and
unnecessary proposal could slip by
unnoticed.
This particular regulation, however, was too
outrageous to miss.
In proposing to lower the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards for ground-level ozone, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is launching what could be its most expensive rulemaking to
date.
According to a study done by the National Association of
Manufacturers, the move would be devastating to the economy, slashing
GDP by $3.4 trillion and costing 2.9 million jobs by
2040.
Economic Burden Would Outweigh Health
Benefits
Specifically, the proposed rule
targets ground-level ozone, which contributes to smog as pollutants in the
air react to heat from the sun.
Unlike the stratospheric ozone
layer that protects Earth from ultraviolet rays, high levels of
ground-level ozone can be harmful to human health.
The basic purpose of
EPA's air quality standard is to ensure that ozone does not reach
these dangerous levels.
The existing standard of 75 parts per
billion (ppb), established in 2008, adequately protects the health of our
citizens.
In fact, air quality has improved, even though this
benchmark has yet to be fully implemented.
It is curious, then, that the Obama Administration now
wants to release an even stricter standard, when such a rule would cause
significant economic harm while providing little or no help to the
environment.
The President acknowledged as much when he refused to
take action on a similar proposal in 2011.
Local governments
and U.S. businesses would be faced with a costly directive to reduce
ozone, ultimately hurting economic development and job creation.
Working families would surely face the impact, too, as energy prices
rise and new job opportunities dwindle.
Moreover, most of the country would not be able to comply
with the Administration's compulsory ozone levels of 65 to 70 ppb.
Even now, 40 percent of the U.S. population lives in areas that do
not meet the existing standard.
Although our state lacks major
smog-filled metropolitan areas, at least five Mississippi counties would
fail to meet 65 ppb.
Areas like DeSoto County would be
especially disadvantaged because of nearby cities like Memphis.
Legislation Challenges Administration's Extreme
Agenda
I am a cosponsor
of two bills in the Senate that would push back against EPA's latest
rulemaking.
One of these measures, known as the "Clean Air,
Strong Economies (CASE) Act," would prohibit EPA from implementing the
more stringent standard until 85 percent of counties currently in
"non-attainment" can comply with existing levels.
Introduced by Sen.
John Thune (R-S.D.), the legislation would also require EPA to assess
the rule's costs and feasibility, which it has not taken into account.
Another bill,
authored by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), would delay a final version of the
ozone rule until 2018.
Titled the "Ozone Regulatory Delay and
Extension of Assessment Length (ORDEAL) Act," it would also extend the
time between revisions of air quality standards by five years, giving
counties more time to enact compliance plans.
I am disappointed that the Obama Administration
continues to pursue a costly environmental agenda when 9 million Americans
remain without work.
It is clear that the President anticipated
the ozone rule would be unpopular, releasing it with more than 3,000
other regulations before Thanksgiving.
But keeping his extensive
bureaucratic agenda quiet does not change its negative impact.
I
am hopeful Congress will use its power to provide proper oversight
and rein in this Administration's excessive executive overreach.
