UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA - - - - -
December 09, 2013
Dear Friend:
On Friday, I joined 31 of my Senate
colleagues in making clear that we must preserve emergency federal
unemployment insurance and not allow it to run out at the end of the
year.
To read our letter, please click
here .
As it stands now, a few days after the holiday season ends, the
expiration of extended unemployment insurance will abruptly cut off
support for 1.3 million Americans
including 222,000
Californians.
We must extend this assistance, which is a lifeline for millions of
Americans and critical to our economic
recovery.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
