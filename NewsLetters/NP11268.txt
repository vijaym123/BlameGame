Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

Hometown News
This past week was a district work period, and I spent Monday in my
hometown of Collinsville. Top, I spoke to an economics class at my alma
mater, Collinsville High School, where students are studying the stock
market. Bottom, I was given a tour of Day & Night Solar, which began
installing solar energy systems in 2009.
The week also included visits to Carmi and Shelbyville, where I held
Open Office Hours, meeting with constituents who wanted to share their
issues with the federal government. In addition, I spoke to students at
Shelbyville High School about the U.S. Constitution.
Bipartisan Letter Warns Obama To Be Careful Negotiating With Iran
I joined 394 colleagues in the House of Representatives in writing
President Obama to describe what we believe must be included in any
final agreement with Iran regarding its pursuit of a nuclear weapons
capability. The letter was spearheaded by Majority Leader Eric Cantor
(R, Virginia-7) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D, Maryland-5) and
signed by 216 Republicans and 179 Democrats.
I concur with Leader Cantor, who said the following about the letter,
which is available online
:
"The Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and it is important
that Members of Congress speak individually and as a body about
important foreign policy matters facing the United States. It is hard
to imagine a more dangerous threat to American national security than
the one posed by Iran, its support for terrorism, its efforts to
destabilize the Middle East, and its determined pursuit of a nuclear
weapons capability. I have profound concerns about the administration's
Iran policy, including the interim deal - which allows Tehran to
continue modernizing its centrifuges and has taken too much
international pressure off Iran.
"I am proud to co-sign a letter to President Obama with Minority Whip
Steny Hoyer and nearly 400 of our colleagues that puts the House on
record about what we expect in any further deals with Iran. This letter
represents a bipartisan consensus about the framework of such a deal,
and about the extraordinary inspections and verification measures that
must accompany any such deal."
C-SPAN Has Experienced Remarkable Growth In Its 35 Years
This past Wednesday marked 35 years since C-SPAN
began broadcasting the proceedings of the U.S. House of
Representatives. It started March 19, 1979, with Speaker Tip O'Neill
gaveling the session to order and a prayer from Chaplain James David
Ford.
Congressman Al Gore, the future vice president, spoke for one minute on
the historic day with this prediction:
"Television will change this institution, Mister Speaker, just as it
has changed the executive branch. But the good will far outweigh the
bad."
In 1979, the network reached only approximately 3 million homes. Today,
C-SPAN can be seen in more than 100 million homes, and it has been
joined by C-SPAN2 (coverage of the U.S. Senate) and C-SPAN3 (other
public affairs programming), plus C-SPAN Radio.

Hometown
News
This
past
week
was
a
district
work
period,
and
I
spent
Monday
in
my
hometown
of
Collinsville.
Top,
I
spoke
to
an
economics
class
at
my

Collinsville

where

Bipartisan
Letter
Warns
Obama To
Be
Careful

Iran
I
joined
394
colleagues
in the
House
of
Representatives
in
writing
President
Obama
to
describe
what we
believe
must
be
included
in
any

regarding
its
pursuit
of
a
nuclear
weapons
capability.
The
letter
was
spearheaded
by
Majority

Virginia-7)
and
Minority
Whip
Steny
Hoyer
(D,
Maryland-5)
and
signed
by
216
Republicans
and
179
Democrats.
I
concur
with
Leader
Cantor,
who
said
the
following
about
the
letter,
which
is
available
online :
&#8220;The
Congress
is
a
co-equal
branch
of
government,
and
it
is
important
that
Members
of
Congress
speak
individually
and
as
a
body
about
important
foreign
policy
matters
facing
the
United
States.
It
is
hard
to
imagine
a
more
dangerous
threat
to
American
national
security
than
the
one
posed
by
Iran,
its
support
for
terrorism,
its
efforts
to
destabilize
the
Middle
East,
and
its
determined
pursuit
of
a
nuclear
weapons
capability.
I
have
profound
concerns
about
the
administration&#8217;s
Iran
policy,
including
the
interim
deal
&#8211;
which
allows
Tehran
to
continue
modernizing
its
centrifuges
and
has
taken
too
much
international
pressure
off
Iran.
&#8220;I

proud
to
co-sign

and
nearly
400
of
our

and
about
