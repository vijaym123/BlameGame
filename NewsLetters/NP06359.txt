$1,85O,OOO.OO
on Illinois T.V.
David -- this is an all-hands-on-deck moment.
Over the weekend, Boehner unleashed a $1.85 MILLION ad campaign to bash Illinois Democrats.
There&rsquo;s no way around it: this could be awful news for Cheri&rsquo;s first re-election campaign. David, we&rsquo;re not giving up hope yet -- but we need to fight back IMMEDIATELY.
Will you chip in $5 or more to our Emergency Rapid Response Fund by midnight to help Cheri prepare for the right-wing onslaught?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
