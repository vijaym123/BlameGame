Dear
Friends,
Our men and women in uniform have
answered the call to defend the United States of American and her people,
and in return, we as a country pledge to provide for many of the
needs of our courageous servicemembers and their families.
For
over a decade, the rise of terrorism in the Middle East compelled
hundreds of thousands of people to join the U.S. military, supporting
Operation Iraqi Freedom followed by Operation Enduring Freedom in
Afghanistan. Many returned to service while others enlisted not fully knowing
what would lie ahead. As the Obama Administration began to wind down
the efforts and withdraw troops from the frontlines, an immense number
of servicemembers returned home in need of a strong support system
that could help treat their physical or invisible wounds, and
help make the transition into civilian life more
successful.
Sen. Inhofe meets with servicemembers
supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in
Afghanistan.
As our new veterans
population grew this past year,
news broke about
the unfortunate state of our Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Unlike
the men and women who the VA is intended to serve, the news was not a
source of pride or honor for our country. Instead, the American public
was exposed to the disturbing and troublesome practices that had
developed overtime at veterans hospitals across the country. We were
all disgusted and together demanded change at the
VA.
At the end of May,
then-Secretary of Veterans
Affairs Eric Shinseki resigned . Shortly there after on July
31,
the Senate passed the
Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014
(H.R. 3230) , a comprehensive, bipartisan
bill to overhaul the VA in order for it to truly fulfill our
countrys promise.
Sen. Inhofe speaks with Oklahoma
Veterans at the World War II Memorial during an Honor Flight to Washington,
D.C.
Included in the VA reform bill were several provisions
that I supported and cosponsored, which served as the foundation for
the reform effort. The most important provision for Oklahoma was the
funding to allow the VA
to enter into 27 new lease
agreements for clinics, including a Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC)
in Tulsa, Okla. First and foremost, our veterans clinics must
have the capacity to treat the volume of veterans that need assistance.
Without enough space, the excessive wait times that became the red
flag for dysfunction at the VA will undoubtedly return. Another provision
in the reform bill will allow veterans without easy access to the VA
clinics or hospitals to seek treatment or care from non-VA medical
providers. And finally, a prominent provision I supported
cuts bureaucratic tape and gives the VA Secretary more authority to
quickly remove any VA employee whose performance warrants
removal.
Oklahoma Veterans watch the changing of the guard
in Arlington National Cemetary during an Honor Flight to Washington,
D.C.- an event that allows U.S. military veterans to visit memorials
dedicated in their honor.
Congress made significant,
much-needed reforms to the department, but this is just the first step and
will require us to
continue to monitor the VA to ensure
success. I will need your help to do this. If you or a family
member who is a veteran is needing help to navigate their VA
benefits or has concerns with the agency, please do not hesitate to
contact my office at (918) 748-5111.
Its
the job of Congress and our country not only to take care of our
veterans but also to acknowledge them. Today we do so by
remembering the selfless service of each man and woman who has taken up the call
to defend our country. It instills a sense of pride beyond
the confines of the service branches and into the homes of all
freedom-loving Americans.
Sincerely,
Jim Inhofe
