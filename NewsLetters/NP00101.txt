Friends,
It is no secret, President
Obama and I do not agree on much.
In fact, since I have been in
Congress I have repeatedly looked for ways to hold the President
accountable.
I certainly would not support legislation that affords
him more power.
The trade regulation bill we passed today
asserts Congressional priorities into trade negotiations and grants
Congress the right to take away the Presidents trade authority at any time
if negotiations become concerning.
For the first time, TPA
requires the President to make any trade agreement public for 60 days
before it can be submitted to Congress for a vote.
There have
been some concerns that the bill allows the President to alter our
immigration laws or that Congress is adjudicating its power.
Both
are simply untrue.
This bill explicitly states that trade
agreements cannot change immigration laws or obligate the U.S. to grant or
expand access to visas.
Without TPA, the President can continue to
negotiate trade deals behind closed doors without any Congressional
oversight.
South Carolina is experiencing a resurgence
in manufacturing.
Our manufacturers need access to the 96
percent of the worlds consumers that live outside of the United
States.
Without trade agreements, our manufacturers face substantial
barriers selling to consumers in other countries.
More than half
a million South Carolina jobs are tied to trade.
I surveyed
several of our largest district employers to get their views on TPA.
Every employer we spoke to supported trade promotional authority.
I also asked you and our e-newsletter subscribers to complete a TPA
poll last week.
Here are the results:
Do you support Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)
?
Where are our
permits?
The Army Corps claims they believe
infrastructure projects impact our countrys natural resources, commerce,
and economy, but the agencys permitting delays and unreliable project
cost estimates paint another picture. So during a Transportation and
Infrastructure hearing last week with the Corps, I made a public plea
to the agency for their help in unraveling the labyrinth of
regulations delaying our districts infrastructure projects like I-73 and the
Georgetown Port.
