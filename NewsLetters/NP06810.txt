David,
My name is Nate Jara, and I was a Summer Fellow on Team Brad.
As a native Californian going to college in New York, moving to Illinois for the summer to work on a campaign seemed a bit off the normal path. But my summer working to reelect Brad Schneider has been an extraordinary and truly unforgettable experience. Now Team Brad has openings for Fall Interns and Fellows. Click here to apply now&gt;&gt;
Interns and Fellows gain invaluable frontline experience, learning campaign tactics and strategy, organizing alongside community leaders, and participating in building our grassroots movement. You will provide valuable, impactful work that is critical to the success of our campaign. Join Team Brad this Fall for the experience of a lifetime. I promise you won't regret it &gt;&gt;
Sincerely,
Nate
