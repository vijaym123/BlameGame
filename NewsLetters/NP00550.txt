My thoughts and prayers go out to all those
affected by the terrible flooding and storms, especially for those
who have lost or are missing loved ones.
While the trouble is far
from over, I am heartened by the courage of our first responders and
the number of Texans coming together to help their neighbors in need
during these difficult times.
As next week is the start of
hurricane season, and with bad weather remaining in parts of our
state, I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and respectful of nature's
fury.
I will be keeping my website updated with the latest
local resources, shelter locations, and road closures here:
