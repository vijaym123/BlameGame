Congressman
Lamborn Supports Energy and Water Appropriations and Strengthens Our
Energy Partnership with Israel
5/1/15
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 2028, the FY 2016 Energy and Water
Appropriations Bill. This legislation ensures the safety of our nuclear
stockpile, provides adequate funding to the Army Corps of Engineers for
critical infrastructure projects, cuts bureaucratic red tape, moves us
further toward the goal of energy independence, and prohibits the
implementation of the EPA's
"Waters of the U.S." rule.
Congressman Lamborn was also able to
insert an amendment strengthening the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation
Program. This critical program allows companies across the U.S. to develop
cutting-edge technologies with new partners in Israel in order to
advance Americas energy goals.
Furthermore, the U.S.-Israel Energy
Cooperative Agreement facilitates greater cooperation and sharing of
knowledge between American and Israeli universities on traditional and
alternative energy.

Program
"H.R. 2028 is a
comprehensive piece of legislation that accomplishes many critical national
security and energy goals, all while cutting over 600 million dollars
from the President's budget request. Two features of this bill are
extremely important to me. First, the efforts made to increase the
safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons security programs are
absolutely essential to our national defense. Second, prohibiting the
out-of-control regulatory mindset at the EPA by stopping "Waters of the U.S."
sends a message to the American people that we are not going to let
belligerent bureaucrats ruin their ability to run their businesses and
live their lives without micromanagement from Washington
DC."
