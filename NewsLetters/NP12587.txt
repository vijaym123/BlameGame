Friend,
We had a meeting with Ami this morning - he wants to know if we&#39;re ready.
Ready for what? For one of the biggest grassroots battles in the country. Our opponents are opening their offices and staffing up their campaigns. We need to be able to match them office for office, staffer for staffer, volunteer for volunteer - and we need to be able to do it quickly.
Can you help us by chipping in $5 or more right now?
Ami agrees that we need to raise at least $5,000 by
February 10th
in order to make some vital budgetary decisions. He&#39;s counting on us - no pressure, right? We need your help to show him that we have what it takes to push back on our opponents.
Click here to give $5 today to show Ami that we have his back and we&#39;re ready to fire on all cylinders.
Thanks for being a part of this team.
Best,
Team Bera
PS: This early goal is crucial to the long term success of our campaign. We&#39;ve made progress, but we need your help to hit $5,000 by
Monday .
Can you pitch in now?
