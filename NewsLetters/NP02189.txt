Dear Friends,
With tax time right around the corner, I wanted to share some important information that I hope will make tax preparation safer and less stressful, and help make sure that you receive the full refund amount you are owed.
The Earned Income Tax Credit
The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is one of the most widely available tax credits. It was introduced in 1975 to lower the tax burden on lower-income workers. In short, it was designed to reward work. The EITC has been expanded many times since then, most recently in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to expand the EITC for families with three or more children and for married couples.
Many taxpayers who were able to work this year have earned this tax credit, and I&rsquo;m pleased to report that applying for it is simple. If you fall into the income categories listed below, fill out and submit this
Schedule EIC
with your Income Tax Return ( Form 1040
or
1040A ). As you will see, the income threshold depends on the number of dependent children you have.
To qualify, your
Earned Income
and your adjusted gross income (AGI) must each be less than:
$46,997 ($52,427 if you and your partner are married and filing jointly) with
three
or more qualifying children
$43,756 ($49,186 if married and filing jointly) with
two
qualifying children
$38,511 ($43,941 if married and filing jointly) with
one
qualifying child
$14,590 ($20,020 if married and filing jointly) with
no
qualifying children
The Internal Revenue Service also offers an EITC Assistant, which you can find at www.IRS.gov.
Tax Scam Alert!
Many con-artists prey on people, especially our senior citizens, during tax time. We have received numerous reports of a popular telephone scam in which callers falsely identify themselves as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees. Please click
this link
to hear one of these scam calls, which was left on the voicemail of one of my constituents.
If you are targeted for this scam, you may be told that you owe money to the IRS and will be threatened with a law suit, suspension of a driver&rsquo;s license or even arrest if you do not pay or call back. You may also be told you have a pending refund but must confirm private information to collect it. If you don&rsquo;t answer the phone, they may leave a phone number with an urgent callback request.
Protect yourself from fraud and identify theft!
The IRS will never request personal information over the phone . The IRS will also:
never
call to demand immediate payment;
never
call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a notice;
never
demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe;
never
require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card;
never
ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone; or
never
threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.
If you have any questions about taxes, potential tax scams, or any other federal issue, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at (800)-964-4699 or at my website
