Happy
Thanksgiving
Dear
Friends,
We have so much to be thankful for again this year. On this
Thanksgiving Day, let us celebrate the many gifts we have to share with our dear
friends and family, remember those who have made sacrifices so that we
could be here today, and look forward in hope that in America there
is always a bright future.
The
holiday we celebrate today has deep roots in our American history.
In 1789, our first president George Washington, proclaimed a time to
be thankful for peace upon ratification of the U.S. Constitution. It
was further solidified as a national holiday in 1863 as President
Abraham Lincoln, leading in the midst of the Civil War, scheduled
Thanksgiving to be the final Thursday of each
November.
Thank you
for the trust you place in me to represent you in
Congress.
From my family to yours, Happy
Thanksgiving!
Sincerely,
Congressman Kevin Yoder
