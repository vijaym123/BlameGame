Dear Friend,
Completing a college education is a landmark achievement in lots of people&rsquo;s lives. But the promise of graduation day shouldn&rsquo;t be accompanied by the hopelessness of a lifetime of debt.
Last year, President Obama signed a bill into law that lowered student loan interest rates for
new
borrowers. Now, we must act to give that same relief to the millions saddled with older loans. I&rsquo;m joining with Senator Elizabeth Warren and more than a dozen of our colleagues to push for current student borrowers to refinance their loans at the same rate as new borrowers -- show your support and sign our petition calling on Congress to act.
Massachusetts is home to the densest concentration of post-secondary schools in the world. The average student borrower in Massachusetts graduates with $28,460 in debt, and allowing those borrowers to refinance their loans would provide an immediate boost to our local economies.
Moreover, those student borrowers would save thousands in interest payments over time. That&rsquo;s money that a struggling generation could use as a down payment on a home, or seed money for a small business. Letting current student borrowers refinance their loans at the same rate as new borrowers is the right thing to do. Add your name to our petition and help us get this through Congress.
Thank you for your support.
