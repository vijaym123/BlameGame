Friends,
Partisanship and gridlock - arent you
tired of it? Me too.
Thats why its a priority of mine to
break through the gridlock, build relationships across the aisle, and
find bipartisan solutions to the problems we face. Ive always said that
you could put me in a room with nearly any Democrat and give us a
problem, and Id work with her or him to find common ground and solve it
without compromising my conservative principles.
Last year, I
championed two bills that unanimously passed Congress and were signed
into law by the president because I worked hard and brought everyone
to the table. Its a rarity, but bipartisanship is
possible.
In that regard, my colleagues on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce
Committee and I are continuing to make good progress. Under Chairman
Fred Uptons leadership, we have made tremendous bipartisan strides to
improve public health.
And this time we are taking it one
step further to accelerate new cures and ensure America remains the
global leader in medical
innovation.
For more than a year, the
committee has worked on the 21 st
Century Cures initiative
to take a comprehensive look at what steps we can take to accelerate
the pace of cures in America.
Were working with patients,
innovators, care givers, regulators, researchers, doctors - you name it -
to build a 21 st
century health care system that encourages
greater innovation, supports advanced research, and streamlines drug
development.
Our end goal is to deliver life-saving cures and
treatments to patients more quickly and more
efficiently.
As health care innovation moves at lightning speed, groundbreaking
discoveries are changing the face of disease treatment, management
and cures. Here in North Carolina, were blessed to have some of the
best health care facilities, universities and corporations that conduct
cutting-edge research to identify, treat and prevent diseases. The
problem is the burdensome regulatory policies and approval infrastructure
are stuck in the past. Our laws have not kept up with innovation.
Washington is holding back new discoveries and advancements in technology
with red-tape and bureaucracy.
If we want to save more lives,
foster American innovation and keep jobs here, Congress must ensure
that our nations laws and regulations not only keep pace, but enable
even more life-saving
innovation.
Im proud to
announce that a few weeks ago the Committee advanced the 21 st
Century Cures Act by a vote of 51-0.
While there is more work
to be done, this is a monumental accomplishment in the path to
accelerate discovery, development and delivery of vital treatments and
cures.
In spite of Washingtons gridlock, there are corners of Congress
where meaningful work gets done on behalf of the American people.
My colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee will
continue to work together on areas where we can find common ground and put
you, your family and your priorities first. The 21 st
Century Cures Act demonstrates that it can be done, and Im proud of the
progress we are making on such a critical, life-saving
issue.
Until next
week,
Richard
