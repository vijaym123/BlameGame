While national media attention has turned to crises outside our borders, we cant forget that a major crisis remains inside our border as well.
The government must ensure the safety and security of our nations borders. This cannot be done if we do not identify and monitor the constant flow of illegal immigrants into our country.
I will continue to oppose all forms of amnesty, support the rule of law, and work to secure our borders.
Keep up with my recent efforts on this issue,

Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - The House passed
H.R. 5272,
with my support, to freeze the Presidents deferred action program as of July 30, 2014 by prohibiting federal funds or resources from being used to process new applications under the program. The bill would also prohibit the Administration from using federal funds or resources to authorize deferred action for any class of illegal immigrants moving forward, and prevent federal funding or resources from being used to authorize work permits for immigrants not lawfully present in the United States.
