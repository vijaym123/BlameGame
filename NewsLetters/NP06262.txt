This week, the House voted on a bipartisan bill to allow for a full audit of the Federal Reserve. Currently, some transactions and areas of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Reserve banks are excluded from the audits conducted by the GAO. This bill, which passed with my support by a vote of 333-92, repeals those limitations.
I am pleased this legislation is headed to the Senate, but it should have happened a long time ago. To achieve real transparency, we need a full audit of the Fed
no exceptions. Its common sense.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I also support a full audit of the Department of Defense. Americans have the right to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent. Read the column I wrote about it,
