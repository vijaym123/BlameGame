As you read this, Cheri&rsquo;s Tea Party opponent is working hand-in-hand with Washington insiders to devise a plan to beat us in November.
Really though, that means one thing: tons and tons of cash. If we can&rsquo;t hit our goal before midnight, it could be a crushing blow to our efforts to keep the Tea Party out of Illinois. But, we just looked over our records, and it looks like you haven&rsquo;t made an online donation to Cheri&rsquo;s campaign in 2014.
If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to step up, THIS IS IT!

FEC Deadline:
Midnight
Suggested donation:
$8.00
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: Chip in $8 or whatever you can right now to help Cheri fight back against Bobby Schilling &gt;&gt; If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: EXPRESS DONATE: $8 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $35 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $50 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $100 &gt;&gt; EXPRESS DONATE: $250 &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
We know we can win this race. In 2012, over $14 million was spent. This year, with our race named a top-ten rematch, you can bet it&rsquo;ll be even more expensive.
So we&rsquo;ve got to be ready. Please, help us prove we can win again and chip in $8 or more right now: http://action.cheribustos.com/Midnight
