Conservation Partnerships Mean Improved Water Quality for
Michigan
Senator Stabenow visited the Saginaw Bay and St. Joseph watershed areas
last week to highlight two historic projects made possible by the 2014
Farm Bill's Regional Conservation Partnership Program. In Frankenmuth,
Stabenow joined with local agriculture and conservation partners to
announce a public-private partnership totaling $20 million to benefit
the Saginaw Bay watershed. Senator Peters of Michigan and Senator
Donnelly of Indiana joined her later to announce a $13.6 million
partnership to improve water quality in the St. Joseph watershed, which
stretches through Michigan and Indiana. "These partnerships represent
two of the largest commitments ever made to water quality in the Great
Lakes," she said. "These innovative projects are truly driven by local
farmers and partners who have the most at stake when it comes to taking
care of our land and water. Working together, these partnerships will
protect the Saginaw Bay and St. Joseph watersheds for families,
boaters, hunters, and anglers to enjoy."
