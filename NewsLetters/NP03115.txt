Dear Friend,
The new
114th Congress is only three weeks old, but the House is already
keeping many of our promises. We have voted to defund the Presidents
unconstitutional immigration plan, started hacking away at ObamaCare (while
also working to repeal it entirely), approved the construction of the
Keystone XL pipeline and banned the use of taxpayer funding for
abortions.
More action on border security and health care are
expected in the coming weeks
so stay tuned!
The President
also recently delivered his State of the Union. Instead of reaching out
to discuss policies both parties could support, I thought he
delivered a divisive and politically charged stump speech. You can watch my
response by

and then share your thoughts on the State of our Union by
answering in the poll question to the right.
