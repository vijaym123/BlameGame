Congressman Lamborn
Stresses the Importance of American Energy
Jobs
6/24/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn chaired a hearing of his Energy and
Mineral Resources Subcommittee on American Energy Jobs:
Opportunities for Education. The hearings discussed job opportunities becoming
available in America's energy sector and the important role played by
our colleges and universities in creating a skilled workforce that is
ready to participate in this growing sector of the
economy.
This boom in energy
development is generating a demand for skilled workers in a broad array of
economic sectors, which poses both opportunities and challenges for
policymakers, businesses and job seekers. Simply looking at the employment
needs in energy producing states shows that these jobs, in oil and gas
specifically, are plentiful and skilled workers are in demand.
Universities and community colleges are working hand in hand with the energy
industry to tailor their programs to the needs of the industry. This
not only includes creating and reinforcing the requisite educational
programs, but offering students internship and apprentice opportunities
in the industry and bringing in highly qualified industry
professionals to teach students the skills needed to succeed in the
industry.

Background information from the House Natural Resources
Committee
Since 2003, Americas
increase in energy production has added more than 400,000 direct energy
jobs to the U.S. economy and millions more indirect jobs. This rise in
energy production is only occurring on state and private lands while
energy production is rapidly decreasing on federal lands. This
underscores the need for important legislation like H.R. 4899, the Lowering
Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America that Works Act. This common sense
legislation will ensure that this growth in energy production continues
well into the future on federal, state, and private lands. This would
only heighten the need for more educational programs to prepare the
next generation of students to meet growing workforce needs in the energy
sector.
