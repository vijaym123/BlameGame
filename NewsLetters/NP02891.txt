Better Serving You
I'm always working hard to improve how I serve you.
Today, I wanted to share what I am doing to better serve Ohio's
Second District. Earlier this
month, Brad Fitch, President of the non-partisan Congressional Management Foundation, wrote about our office's efforts to solicit your feedback on my office's customer service.

ROLL CALL : How to Conduct a
Congressional Customer Service Survey
"Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, took the bold move of surveying his constituents eight months into his freshman term in 2013.
The survey was important to do as early as possible, so we could measure trends and performance over time in order to make adjustments when constituents are clearly telling us something isnt working, Wenstrup said. His office reached out to the CMF for guidance on developing the survey tool, and we helped draft questions to prompt real data. The results and response rates were wildly successful; they would make even Amazon.com envious. Heres how the office did it and the results.
"The survey included generic, non-leading questions. The questions looked like a garden-variety customer service survey. How would you rate your overall satisfaction with your experience with Rep. Wenstrups office? The answers offered typical choices: very satisfied, satisfied, unsatisfied, very unsatisfied. If you want honest answers, you have to ask honest questions. First and foremost, dont be afraid of the answers, said Derek Harley, Wenstrups chief of staff. Sometimes, there can be a tendency to ask questions in a way that gets a particular response.

"The response rate was remarkable. The first survey in September 2013 garnered a 34 percent open rate, much higher than any industry average by any measurement. More than 10 percent of the recipients took the survey, a conversion rate four times higher than private sector comparisons. Of those surveyed, 75 percent rated their experience with the office satisfied or very satisfied."
