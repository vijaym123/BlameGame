Wisdom of the District: Presidential Authority
According to news sources,
President Obama addressed his Cabinet
earlier this year and said, Ive got a pen, and Ive got a phone.
We are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we are providing Americans the kind of help that they need.
Shortly after, the
President said in the State of the Union Address : In the coming weeks I will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty.
An Executive Order is an act without the consent of Congress.
Do you believe that style of governing is justified in order to advance the President's agenda or that the President is overstepping his boundaries?
( ) His actions are justified.
Congress has been dragging its feet.
( ) He has overstepped his boundaries.
In a divided government, as set up by our Founders, the President must work with Congress to represent the views of all Americans.
( ) Some of his executive orders are justified, but others reflect an unwillingness to accept the constraints of a divided government.
( ) I have another answer.
