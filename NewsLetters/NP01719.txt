Friend,
I have some great news!
Our dollar-for-dollar match has been extended&mdash;all contributions up to $15,000 will be matched until midnight tonight.
We&rsquo;re $4,839 away from our goal.
Will you chip in $5 or more to push us over the edge?
Your contribution will be doubled if you can give today.
It&rsquo;s our first deadline of the year, and hitting our goal is important.
Thank you for standing with me.
Be well,
Ami

Good news!
We&rsquo;ve had another supporter offer to match contributions.
That means all contributions raised online up to $15,000 will be matched dollar-for-dollar.
We&rsquo;re close to hitting that mark&mdash;only $4,839 to go&mdash; but we need a few more folks to pitch in before midnight.
Would you mind forwarding, and I&rsquo;ll make a few calls?
Thank you!

Elena&mdash;how close are we to our online goal? I want to make sure we take full advantage of the donor match.
Be well,
