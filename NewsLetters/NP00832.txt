Dear Friend,
This past week, I traveled to Israel to
meet with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and
other senior Israeli and Palestinian
leaders. The trip, which was sponsored by
the American Israel Education Foundation
(AIEF) and at no expense to taxpayers,
offered a unique opportunity to speak about
the relationship between our governments.
We discussed a wide range of issues
concerning political developments in
Israel, regional security in the Middle
East, and the ongoing peace process. In
addition, we spoke about our
countrys shared interest in
preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear
weapon.
Iran has long been a threat to U.S.
national security interests, not only
exemplified by Tehran's nuclear program but
also by its material assistance to armed
extremist groups. Irans attempts to
gain access to nuclear weapons greatly
undermine 60 years of U.S. efforts toward
nuclear non-proliferation.
Currently, combinations of economic and
diplomatic sanctions have been placed on
Iran to force the nation to decide whether
or not it wants to join the international
community. In November of 2014, however,
the administration entered into an interim
deal with Iran, under which Iran agreed to
roll back portions of its nuclear program
in return for some relief from current
sanctions. The negotiations were slated to
last six months, but after more than a year
of diplomatic talks without an agreement,
Secretary of State John Kerry announced a
seven month extension of negotiations. On
April 2, 2015, an agreement on the
framework for a tentative deal was
reached.
The framework requires Iran to agree to
restrictions on its nuclear program in
return for economic sanctions relief. This
would allow Iran to continue to operate its
nuclear power plants, but prevent Iran from
producing weapons-grade uranium. In return,
the current economic sanctions on Iran
would gradually be lifted. However, many of
the sanctions would be suspended instead of
permanently repealed, which would allow for
them to be reapplied if Iran is not
adhering to its end of the deal. There are
still several details that must be agreed
to and there is no guarantee that what is
in the framework will be included in the
deal, which must be finalized by June 30,
2015.
A nuclear Iran is an unacceptable
outcome that jeopardizes the security of
the United States, Israel, and the entire
Middle East. That is why I recently signed
a letter with colleagues from both sides of
the aisle urging the administration to
consult more closely with Congress on any
sanctions relief package that may be
included in the final agreement. In
addition, I signed a bipartisan letter
expressing concern over Iran's lack of
cooperation with the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
This past week, the Senate
passed the
Iran
Nuclear Agreement Review Act by
98-1. This legislation would give Congress
a voice in any nuclear agreement with Iran.
It would require a completed deal to be
submitted to Congress, which could then
vote to approve or disapprove the nuclear
deal within 30 days. Additionally,
sanctions on Iran could not be lifted
during this consideration. This legislation
ensures that the details of any final deal
are transparent, congressional oversight is
instituted, and Iran will be held
accountable. I look forward to this
legislation receiving a vote in the House
of Representatives, so that Congress
and the American people
have the opportunity to have their voices
heard.
Rep. Renacci and members of Congress
meet with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in Israel this past week.
