Small businesses are one of the greatest tools we have for lighting up the economy. Thats why I make it a priority to ease regulatory burdens, provide access to capital, and support small business growth. Its why I cosponsored the REINS Act ( H.R. 427 ), which reintroduces common sense into the regulatory process by requiring Congress to vote on all new major regulations before they are enforced on citizens and businesses. And its why I make it a point to regularly check in with small business owners across the 4 th
District and get their feedback, ideas, and insight on the challenges theyre facing.
Bureaucrats in Washington do not create jobs. Instead, the federal government should act to enable (not obstruct) economic growth for the real job creators in America: small businesses and American entrepreneurs.
Yours in service,
Randy
