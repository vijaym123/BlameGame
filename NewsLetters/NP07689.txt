Never in US history has the House of Representatives sued a sitting president -- but that&rsquo;s exactly what Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans are doing.
But there is good news -- you're fighting back! Even Rachel Maddow noticed your incredible response:
&ldquo;&hellip;the most amazing thing to watch is to see if the Republicans cool to [Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit] idea when they realize how much money the Democrats are raising off of it.&rdquo;
Since Republicans voted to sue the President yesterday, more than 28,000 of you have stepped up. But we still need 11,331 more donations today to fully respond to Boehner's historic obstruction: Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00 ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
