Our
Graduates Need the Opportunity to Pursue
the American Dream
Dear Friend,
Many high school and college students in
Virginias Fifth District and across
the country are approaching graduation or
have recently graduated. They have reached
an exciting milestone in their lives and
are well-prepared to apply the knowledge
and skill they have developed in the
workforce. While the economy has improved,
we still have yet to see the type of
dynamic job creation needed to provide
robust opportunities for our young people
to start their careers.
While last weeks jobs report
found that our economy added jobs last
month, we also saw a number of discouraging
economic indicators. The unemployment rate
remained relatively unchanged
at
5.5 percent , and in many Central and
Southside Virginia localities the
unemployment rate far exceeds the national
average. The number of people who are not
working nor looking for work remains near
the
highest level since the 1970s , and too
many who would rather work full-time are
settling for part time work. Last month, we
learned that the first quarter gross
domestic product - the value of everything
we as a nation produce -
shrank
by 0.7 percent . These statistics
reflect what we see in our communities -
that more must be done to bring about a
healthy economy.
We did get some good news last week as
Monogram Food Solutions announced it
will
create over 100 new jobs in Henry
County , where the unemployment rate far
exceeds the national average. Private
investment like this is essential to the
economic recovery in the Fifth District and
the nation, but Washington still has more
work to do in removing the federal
government as a barrier to economic
growth.
In Congress, we are laser-focused on
promoting policies that will foster growth
for small businesses and allow them to
create good jobs for those still looking
for work. We have taken significant steps
toward implementing a simpler, fairer tax
code to make it easier for our small
businesses to create the jobs
Virginias Fifth District needs.
While I remain committed to repealing the
Presidents healthcare law and
replacing it with real healthcare reform,
based upon market-oriented principles, we
have worked to minimize the harmful effects
of the Presidents healthcare law on
small businesses in the interim.
I have also introduced two bills to
ensure that the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) does not unnecessarily
hinder job creation.
The
Small Company Disclosure Simplification
Act
is a commonsense solution that will
ease the regulatory burden for smaller
public companies and require the SEC to
perform a cost-benefit analysis on the
regulations impact on these
companies.
The
Streamlining Excessive and Costly
Regulations Review Act
is a
good-government measure requiring the SEC
to comprehensively review its regulations
every ten years to streamline their rules
and ensure they are all up-to-date.I
am pleased that they have both
passed
the Financial Services Committee with
bipartisan support , and I look forward
to the bills consideration by the
full House of Representatives.
With graduation comes an infusion of new
talented, driven, and enthusiastic young
people into our workforce. We must adopt
policies that give them opportunities to
innovate and flourish for the betterment of
our communities. The House will continue to
work to pave the way for economic growth,
and it is my fervent hope that the Senate
and the President join us. I will continue
to fight for solutions that will help get
our economy back on track so that our
graduates and other job seekers have the
opportunity to pursue the American
Dream.
