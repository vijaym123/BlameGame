News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
December 23, 2013
Dear Friends,
Merry Christmas!
As we close out 2013, I want to thank you for giving me the privilege
of serving as your representative in Washington.
People often ask me
what I like best about this job, and the truth is that it's working for
you.
In West Texas and the Big Country, we value independence, hard work,
and family.
For every policy we consider, I ask myself whether it
represents those values, and whether it's in the best interest of our
country.
Sometimes, that means making difficult decisions.
But what
makes it all worth it is when I come home to Texas and speak to you and
your neighbors.
Some of the most important work my office does isn't
on legislation-it's on constituent services
.
Whether it's helping veterans get the benefits they've earned, or
arranging for your family to tour the Capitol, my staff and I are
working on your behalf every day.
Here's an overview of what we worked
on this year:
I'm looking forward to continuing to serve you in 2014.
This will be
the last Roundup of the year-look for the next one on Monday, January
6.
Until then, I wish you and your family a blessed Christmas and a happy
New Year.
