Free trade is vital to the U.S. economy and is
important to sharpen our global edge.
However, accurate information
is also vital when considering any trade policy.
Unfortunately,
there is a lot of misinformation and outright falsehoods being spread
by different groups concerning our negotiations on trade.
Here is
my assessment of what is important for everyone to
consider.
Free trade agreements are negotiated through the Executive
Branch, which, given the track record of the Obama Administrations
foreign and economic policies, is a concern.
Many southwest
Missourians have told me they do not trust President Obama to negotiate trade
deals, which is exactly why we need a mechanism to keep presidential
power in check.
Trade Promotion
Authority
(TPA) is that mechanism, which Congress established in 1934 to
strengthen its constitutional obligations to regulate trade with foreign
nations and check the executives power while streamlining the trade
agreement approval process.
It last lapsed in 2007, and every
president except Nixon and Obama has had TPA since Franklin
Roosevelt.
As
proposed , TPA would give Congress
access to trade negotiations and
require any negotiated trade deal to
be public for 60 days prior to Congress making a decision .
That strengthens accountability and transparency and makes sure we
fully understand the ramifications of any trade deal.
It sets 150
objectives any trade deal must meet to be considered under TPA.
Any deal failing to meet the objectives in this TPA bill would be
denied fast-track authority and would be subject to congressional
amendment.
Congress would ultimately have the final say on trade deals,
allowing the American people to hold their elected officials
accountable.
TPA is
not
a trade deal, but
rather a step added to the free trade agreement process.
TPA has
been confused with another acronym: TPP, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership .
TPP continues to be negotiated among 12
nations surrounding the Pacific Ocean; therefore, TPP does not yet
exist.
TPA would be used to make TPP and other free trade deals over
the next six years, such as the
Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership
(T-TIP), more transparent and expose its
details up to two months before Congress takes any final
action.
I voted for TPA because I want to see what is in TPP, and I want
you to see it too.
Free trade helps American
businesses access the 96 percent of the global market residing beyond our
borders.
TPA would be a law guiding negotiations to make sure free
trade agreements are a win for American workers and to put us on a
level playing field with countries that would not otherwise adhere to our
rules.
In other words, we set the standards for global trade
not China.
We can make sure Americans get the best deal
possible.
We can grow the more than $650 million free trade impact on
Missouris Seventh District.
We can get more Ozarks-, Missouri- and
American-made products to people around the world.
