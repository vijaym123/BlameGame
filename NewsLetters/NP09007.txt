A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
June 1, 2014
Dear Friends,
"Honor" is a word that has come up time and again this week: To honor,
to restore honor, to be honored. Keep reading for a wrap-up of the week
that was:
To honor: It was my privilege to honor the men and women who served and
sacrificed for our country at the Antigo Memorial Day service. To our
Veterans who have gone before us in death, I offered a promise to
remember them always. To the Veterans in attendance, I offered a salute
to their service. To the wounded, I pledged to do everything in my
power to help them return to good health and good function.
To restore honor:
Our Veterans served our country and were promised
the care of a grateful nation in return. Recent events have shown that
our government and the administrative officials who run it, have not
held-up their end of the agreement. This week I called for the
resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Trust is an
integral part of carrying out the mission of our military.
Unfortunately, by failing to carry out the mission of the VA, he has
lost my trust, but more importantly, that of our Veterans.
Sec. Shinseki is an honorable man of service, but stepping down was the
right thing to do. By accepting his resignation, the President is
rightfully holding the Secretary accountable, but he now needs to take
responsibility for his role in the VA's tragic state of affairs, that
have largely happened under his watch, and take immediate steps to
restore honor to the VA and the Veterans it serves.
Honored to serve: This week I was offered a new committee post on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. From my joint statement with Chairman
Ed Royce following the announcement:
"The world has become an increasingly dangerous place. I look forward
to working on the issues that drive America's global engagement.
Although the President has stumbled on his foreign policy positions,
the United States must stand firm in our efforts to promote democratic
values and religious liberty. At home in Wisconsin, I look forward to
building on our trade partnerships with our allies in the global
economy. I am grateful to Chairman Royce for his leadership on these
issues and for allowing me the opportunity and honor to serve on this
distinguished committee." To read the full statement, click here
.
One more thing before you go: This week the House passed the Commerce
Justice and Science Appropriations bill. Fortunately, through a strong
grassroots advocacy effort and thanks to many constituents who called
my office and that of many other Members of Congress, my amendment to
keep critical functions of the internet in the United States' domain
was included.
As Americans, we value our Constitutional right of Freedom of Speech
and have promoted this value throughout the world. The U.S. is best
positioned to maintain and protect a free and open Internet, through
its stewardship of these critical functions, as it has done for
decades.
We should not give up this stewardship and allow the United Nations or
countries like China, Iran, or Russia, that do not hold free speech in
the same regard, the opportunity to take control. If the U.S. turns
over this responsibility to the international community, there is no
turning back. Read my full statement here
.
Thank you to all of the men and women who serve our nation, both
military and civilian and at home and abroad. It is my honor to
represent you in Congress. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
June 1, 2014
Dear
Friends,
&#8220;Honor&#8221;
is
a
word
that
has
come
up
time
and
again
this
week:
To
honor,
to
restore
honor,
to
be
honored.
Keep
reading
for
a
wrap-up
of
the
week
that
was:
To
honor:
It
was
my
privilege
to
honor
the
men
and
women
who
served
and
sacrificed
for
our
country
at
the
Antigo
Memorial
Day
service.
To
our
Veterans
who
have
gone
before
us
in
death,
I
offered
a
promise
to
remember
them
always.
To
the
Veterans
in
attendance,
I
offered
a
salute
to
their
service.
To
the
wounded,
I
pledged
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
help
them
return
to
good
health
and
good
function.
To
restore
honor:
Our
Veterans
served
our
country
and
were
promised
the
care
of
a
grateful
nation
in
return.
Recent
events
have
shown
that
our
government
and
the
administrative
officials
who
run
it,
have
not
held-up
their
end
of
the
agreement.
This
week
I
called
for
the
resignation
of
Veterans
Affairs
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki.
Trust
is
an
integral
part
of
carrying
out
the
mission
of
our
military.
Unfortunately,
by
failing
to
carry
out
the
mission
of
the
VA,
he
has
lost
my
trust,
but
more
importantly,
that
of
our
Veterans.
Sec.
Shinseki
is
an
honorable
man
of
service,
but
stepping
down
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
By
accepting
his
resignation,
the
President
is
rightfully
holding
the
Secretary
accountable,
but
he
now
needs
to
take
responsibility
for
his
role
in
the
VA's
tragic
state
of
affairs,
that
have
largely
happened
under
his
watch,
and
take
immediate
steps
to
restore
honor
to
the
VA
and
the
Veterans
it
serves.
Honored
to
serve:
This
week
I
was
offered
a
new
committee
post
on
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee.
From
my
joint
statement
with
Chairman
Ed
Royce
following
the
announcement:
&#8220; The
world
has
become
an
increasingly
dangerous
place.
I
look
forward
to
working
on
the
issues
that
drive
America's
global
engagement.
Although
the
President
has
stumbled
on
his
foreign
policy
positions,
the
United
States
must
stand
firm
in
our
efforts
to
promote
democratic
values
and
religious
liberty.
At
home
in
Wisconsin,
I
look
forward
to
building
on
our
trade
partnerships
with
our
allies
in
the
global
economy.
I
am
grateful
to
Chairman
Royce
for
his
leadership
on
these
issues
and
for
allowing
me
the
opportunity
and
honor
to
serve
on
this
distinguished
committee."

One
more
thing
before
you
go:
This
week
the
House
passed
the
Commerce
Justice
and
Science
Appropriations
bill.
Fortunately,
through
a
strong
grassroots
advocacy
effort
and
thanks
to
many
constituents
who
called
my
office
and
that
of
many
other
Members
of
Congress,
my
amendment
to
keep
critical
functions
of
the
internet
in
the
United
States&#8217;
domain
was
included.
As
Americans,
we
value
our
Constitutional
right
of
Freedom
of
Speech
and
have
promoted
this
value
throughout
the
world.
The
U.S.
is
best
positioned
to
maintain
and
protect
a
free
and
open
Internet,
through
its
stewardship
of
these
critical
functions,
as
it
has
done
for
decades.
We
should
not
give
up
this
stewardship
and
allow
the
United
Nations
or
countries
like
China,
Iran,
or
Russia,
that
do
not
hold
free
speech
in
the
same
regard,
the
opportunity
to
take
control.
If
the
U.S.
turns
over
this
responsibility
to
the
international
community,
there
is
no
turning
back.

Thank
you
to
all
of
the
men
and
women
who
serve
our
nation,
both
military
and
civilian
and
at
home
and
abroad.
It
is
my
honor
to
represent
you
in
Congress.
Until
next
week&#8230;
