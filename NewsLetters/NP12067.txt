Hello!
I want to make certain that we're
able to stay in touch about the important things happening in the San
Fernando Valley, and what I'm doing here in Washington to help create
new jobs and protect Valley families. Because of election laws, if you
aren't subscribed to my e-newsletter, I won't be able to keep you
up-to-date for the next three months. It's called the "blackout period"
and I want to make sure you aren't out of the loop during these 90
days.
It's very easy to sign up for my
newsletter. Simply visit
my website
to sign up or click

Thank you for taking the
time read our e-newsletters, I hope you subscribe so we can keep
letting you know about the news that's important to
you!
Have a great
day,
