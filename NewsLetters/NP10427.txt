project
Congressman Adam Kinzinger on Thursday toured the
Marseilles Lock and Dam repair project with Marseilles Mayor Patti
Smith and Col. Mark Deschenes, Rock Island District Commander for the U.S.

announcement by Rep. Kinzinger that USACE will provide $35 million for the

requested by Rep. Kinzinger. The funding will lead to the full repair
of the lock and dam by 2017, which was damaged during spring 2013
flooding.
