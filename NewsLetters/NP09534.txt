Walking to Battle Cancer
Hi All!
I hope you all had a terrific weekend.
Last week, I walked in the Rock
'N Race to help fight cancer and visited a number of businesses and
nonprofits across the Granite State.
Spring has finally arrived in New
Hampshire!
With Steph, her family, and Pete Burdett, Chairman of the State
Veterans Advisory Committee
Walking with Steph Strong
On Thursday, I had the wonderful opportunity to walk in the 12th Annual
Rock 'N Race as a proud member of team Steph Strong.
Over 6,000 people
participated in this 5K race through downtown Concord, which raises
money for the Payson Center for Cancer Care at Concord Hospital.
It
was an amazing event with local bands playing all along the route, and
I was thrilled to be a part of it.
Team Steph Strong was formed by Lieutenant Colonel Steph Riley, an
inspiring woman who I am blessed to call a friend.
Steph is an Air
Force veteran, a nurse, and a current member of the New Hampshire
National Guard. She beat breast cancer last year, and is now battling
lung cancer.
I was honored to join Steph Strong.
At the Drug Abuse roundtable in Newport
Discussing the Fight Against Drug Abuse in Newport
On Tuesday, I met with a group of local law enforcement officials,
medical providers, and other community leaders to discuss efforts to
solve the drug abuse epidemic facing the Claremont and Newport area and
New Hampshire as a whole.
The discussion built upon the drug abuse
forum held last month in Claremont, and gave the community a chance to
share with me their efforts to address the epidemic at the local level.
Far too many families in Newport and across the state have been
affected by the increasingly severe drug abuse epidemic. We must come
together to put a stop to the abuse, and ensure victims and their
families can access the help they need to move forward on a better
path.
I was so pleased to hear about the local efforts taking place,
and I will continue to do everything I can on the federal level to
support the community's work and help New Hampshire families live
healthy, happy lives free of drug abuse.
During the tour at Genfoot
Innovative Manufacturing in Littleton
On Wednesday, I toured and met with workers at Genfoot, a small
footwear manufacturing business in Littleton.
During the tour, I
announced my recent action to protect jobs at Genfoot and other U.S.
footwear manufacturing companies. Genfoot is one of only a handful of
footwear companies left that manufactures rubber and plastic footwear
in the United States.
Genfoot employs approximately 100 workers in
Littleton, but recently these jobs have been threatened by legislation
that would provide an unfair advantage to foreign companies whose
products compete with American-made goods like those made at Genfoot.
I filed a formal objection to this legislation on behalf of Genfoot and
its employees.
We must ensure Congress does not inadvertently help their foreign
competition, which could threaten these great Granite State
manufacturing jobs.
I am proud to work against any such proposals in
Congress on behalf of Genfoot, and I was so pleased to get a chance to
tour the factory and hear from employees firsthand about other actions
Congress can take to support their success.
At the roundtable in Berlin
Meeting with Women in the North Country
During my trip to the North Country, I continued my "Women's Economic
Agenda" listening tour with a roundtable discussion in Berlin about the
issues facing women professionals across the Granite State.
During the
discussion, I met with a diverse group of female business leaders to
discuss my recently released Women's Economic Agenda. Participants
shared their own personal experiences with some of the issues outlined
in my agenda, including pay equity, family leave time, and access to
capital.
Roundtable participants included representatives from the
Women's Rural Entrepreneurial Network (WREN), the executive director of
the North Country Council, and a number of North Country small business
owners.
During the discussion, I was so grateful to hear from inspiring New
Hampshire women business leaders about how we can bridge the gender
wage gap and address other issues I've outlined in my agenda.
Discussing everything from equal pay to college affordability issues,
these women underscored the need for Congress to prioritize initiatives
that will help level the playing field for New Hampshire women.
At the human trafficking roundtable
Working to End Human Trafficking
On Thursday, I hosted a roundtable at the New Hampshire Coalition
Against Domestic and Sexual Violence to discuss local efforts to curb
human trafficking and provide support for victims at home and abroad.
I discussed my recent efforts in Congress
to fight back against Boko
Haram, the terrorist group that kidnapped nearly 300 girls in Nigeria,
and also announced a package of legislation that I'm cosponsoring in
Congress to address human trafficking across the globe.
The horrific kidnapping of the female Nigerian school students has
shocked the world.
However, human trafficking is not just a foreign
issue, and I heard from community leaders, law enforcement officials,
academic researchers, advocates, and trafficking victims about the
ongoing occurrences of human and sex trafficking - including in our own
backyard.
Roundtable participants shared their own stories with me,
which underscored the need for Congress to better help prevent human
trafficking and provide increased support for victims.
During my visit to LARC
Visiting the Legal Advice and Referral Center
I also visited the Legal Advice and Referral Center (LARC) in Concord,
where I met with staff and heard about the range of legal services that
LARC offers to Granite Staters.
I highlighted my support for the Legal
Services Corporation, which provides funding to LARC, and thanked LARC's
staff for the Center's legal aid work with low-income individuals and
families throughout New Hampshire.
The Legal Advice and Referral
Center provides free legal aid services to low-income Granite Staters
anywhere in New Hampshire.
Through a combination of education,
coaching, and legal advice, LARC prepares over 3,000 clients a year to
represent themselves in housing, benefits, and family matters.
The staff at the Legal Advice and Referral Center is doing critical
work providing low-income Granite Staters with the legal services they
desperately need.
For men and women who find themselves facing complex
legal situations and don't know where else to turn, LARC is an
excellent resource.
Have an excellent week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a wonderful place to live!

Walking
to
Battle
Cancer
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
terrific
weekend.
Last
week,
I
walked
in
the
Rock
&#8216;N
Race
to
help
fight
cancer
and
visited
a
number
of
businesses
and
nonprofits
across
the
Granite
State.
Spring
has
finally
arrived
in
New
Hampshire!
With
Steph,
her
family,
and
Pete
Burdett,
Chairman
of
the
State
Veterans
Advisory
Committee Walking
with
Steph
Strong
On
Thursday,
I
had
the
wonderful
opportunity
to
walk
in
the
12 th
Annual
Rock
&#8216;N
Race
as
a
proud
member
of
team
Steph
Strong.
Over
6,000
people
participated
in
this
5K
race
through
downtown
Concord,
which
raises
money
for
the
Payson
Center
for
Cancer
Care
at
Concord
Hospital.
It
was
an
amazing
event
with
local
bands
playing
all
along
the
route,
and
I
was
thrilled
to
be
a
part
of
it.
Team
Steph
Strong
was
formed
by
Lieutenant
Colonel
Steph
Riley,
an
inspiring
woman
who
I
am
blessed
to
call
a
friend.
Steph
is
an
Air
Force
veteran,
a
nurse,
and
a
current
member
of
the
New
Hampshire
National
Guard. She
beat
breast
cancer
last
year,
and
is
now
battling
lung
cancer.
I
was
honored
to
join
Steph
Strong.
At
the
Drug
Abuse
roundtable
in
Newport Discussing
the
Fight
Against
Drug
Abuse
in
Newport
On
Tuesday ,
I
met
with
a
group
of
local
law
enforcement
officials,
medical
providers,
and
other
community
leaders
to
discuss
efforts
to
solve
the
drug
abuse
epidemic
facing
the
Claremont
and
Newport
area
and
New
Hampshire
as
a
whole.
The
discussion
built
upon
the
drug
abuse
forum
held
last
month
in
Claremont,
and
gave
the
community
a
chance
to
share
with
me
their
efforts
to
address
the
epidemic
at
the
local
level.
Far
too
many
families
in
Newport
and
across
the
state
have
been
affected
by
the
increasingly
severe
drug
abuse
epidemic. We
must
come
together
to
put
a
stop
to
the
abuse,
and
ensure
victims
and
their
families
can
access
the
help
they
need
to
move
forward
on
a
better
path.
I
was
so
pleased
to
hear
about
the
local
efforts
taking
place,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
everything
I
can
on
the
federal
level
to
support
the
community&#8217;s
work
and
help
New
Hampshire
families
live
healthy,
happy
lives
free
of
drug
abuse.
During
the
tour
at
Genfoot Innovative
Manufacturing
in
Littleton
On
Wednesday ,
I
toured
and
met
with
workers
at
Genfoot,
a
small
footwear
manufacturing
business
in
Littleton.
During
the
tour,
I
announced
my
recent
action
to
protect
jobs
at
Genfoot
and
other
U.S.
footwear
manufacturing
companies. Genfoot
is
one
of
only
a
handful
of
footwear
companies
left
that
manufactures
rubber
and
plastic
footwear
in
the
United
States.
Genfoot
employs
approximately
100
workers
in
Littleton,
but
recently
these
jobs
have
been
threatened
by
legislation
that
would
provide
an
unfair
advantage
to
foreign
companies
whose
products
compete
with
American-made
goods
like
those
made
at
Genfoot.
I
filed
a
formal
objection
to
this
legislation
on
behalf
of
Genfoot
and
its
employees.
We
must
ensure
Congress
does
not
inadvertently
help
their
foreign
competition,
which
could
threaten
these
great
Granite
State
manufacturing
jobs.
I
am
proud
to
work
against
any
such
proposals
in
Congress
on
behalf
of
Genfoot,
and
I
was
so
pleased
to
get
a
chance
to
tour
the
factory
and
hear
from
employees
firsthand
about
other
actions
Congress
can
take
to
support
their
success.
At
the
roundtable
in
Be rl in Meeting
with
Women
in
the
North
Cou nt ry
During
my
trip
to
the
North
Country ,
I
continued
my
&#8220;Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda&#8221;
listening
tour
with
a
roundtable
discussion
in
Berlin
about
the
issues
facing
women
professionals
across
the
Granite
State.
During
the
discussion,
I
met
with
a
diverse
group
of
female
business
leaders
to
discuss
my
recently
released
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda.
Participants
shared
their
own
personal
experiences
with
some
of
the
issues
outlined
in
my
agenda,
including
pay
equity,
family
leave
time,
and
access
to
capital.
Roundtable
participants
included
representatives
from
the
Women&#8217;s
Rural
Entrepreneurial
Network
(WREN),
the
executive
director
of
the
North
Country
Council,
and
a
number
of
North
Country
small
business
owners.
During
the
discussion,
I
was
so
grateful
to
hear
from
inspiring
New
Hampshire
women
business
leaders
about
how
we
can
bridge
the
gender
wage
gap
and
address
other
issues
I&#8217;ve
outlined
in
my
agenda.
Discussing
everything
from
equal
pay
to
college
affordability
issues,
these
women
underscored
the
need
for
Congress
to
prioritize
initiatives
that
will
help
level
the
playing
field
for
New
Hampshire
women.
At
the
human
trafficking
roundtable Working
to
End
Human
Trafficking
On
Thursday ,
I
hosted
a
roundtable
at
the
New
Hampshire
Coalition
Against
Domestic
and
Sexual
Violence
to
discuss
local
efforts
to
curb
human
trafficking
and
provide
support
for
victims
at
home
and
abroad.
I
discussed
my
recent
efforts
in
Congress
to
fight
back
against
Boko
Haram,
the
terrorist
group
that
kidnapped
nearly
300
girls
in
Nigeria,
and
also
announced
a
package
of
legislation
that
I&#8217;m
cosponsoring
in
Congress
to
address
human
trafficking
across
the
globe.
The
horrific
kidnapping
of
the
female
Nigerian
school
students
has
shocked
the
world.
However,
human
trafficking
is
not
just
a
foreign
issue,
and
I
heard
from
community
leaders,
law
enforcement
officials,
academic
researchers,
advocates,
and
trafficking
victims
about
the
ongoing
occurrences
of
human
and
sex
trafficking
&#8211;
including
in
our
own
backyard.
Roundtable
participants
shared
their
own
stories
with
me,
which
underscored
the
need
for
Congress
to
better
help
prevent
human
trafficking
and
provide
increased
support
for
victims.
During
my
visit
to
LARC Visiting
the
Legal
Advice
and
Referral
Center
I
also
visited
the
Legal
Advice
and
Referral
Center
(LARC)
in
Concord,
where
I
met
with
staff
and
heard
about
the
range
of
legal
services
that
LARC
offers
to
Granite
Staters.
I
highlighted
my
support
for
the
Legal
Services
Corporation,
which
provides
funding
to
LARC,
and
thanked
LARC&#8217;s
staff
for
the
Center&#8217;s
legal
aid
work
with
low-income
individuals
and
families
throughout
New
Hampshire.
The
Legal
Advice
and
Referral
Center
provides
free
legal
aid
services
to
low-income
Granite
Staters
anywhere
in
New
Hampshire.
Through
a
combination
of
education,
coaching,
and
legal
advice,
LARC
prepares
over
3,000
clients
a
year
to
represent
themselves
in
housing,
benefits,
and
family
matters.
The
staff
at
the
Legal
Advice
and
Referral
Center
is
doing
critical
work
providing
low-income
Granite
Staters
with
the
legal
services
they
desperately
need.
For
men
and
women
who
find
themselves
facing
complex
legal
situations
and
don&#8217;t
know
where
else
to
turn,
LARC
is
an
excellent
resource.
Have
an
excellent
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you
do
to
make
New
Hampshire
such
a
wonderful
place
to
live!
