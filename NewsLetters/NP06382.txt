Dear Neighbor,
My
Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act , or &ldquo; RAMI ,&rdquo;
passed the House today
with a strong showing of support from Members on both sides of the aisle. We tirelessly advocate for U.S. manufacturing through this bill, having spent the last year
meeting with district manufacturers
for input and educating Members of Congress on the need to stay on the cutting edge of manufacturing in the US.
In these hyper partisan times, it can be difficult to build consensus, but that is what we did to put RAMI on a path to successful passage. Our bill
passed
the House Committee on Science in a unanimous vote in July and with 100 bipartisan co-sponsors, overwhelmingly passed in the House this evening. The overwhelming vote in the House bodes well for a vote in the Senate.
Our bill creates a network of regional institutes across the country designed to commercialize research and development into manufactured products, train an advanced manufacturing workforce, and support manufacturers of all sizes. As demand grows for highly-skilled workers, it&rsquo;s increasingly important we bridge the workforce development gap to fill in-demand positions.
This is about creating the kinds of high-tech, high-paying jobs we want to see our children and grandchildren in, jobs that give them those opportunities to create and innovate here at home &ndash; not across the ocean. RAMI sets the stage for those jobs and makes sure the U.S. is a world leader in advanced manufacturing.
RAMI is more than a bill, it&rsquo;s an opportunity for the United States to bring jobs back to our shores so that we can &ldquo;make it here and sell it there.&rdquo;
Best, Tom
