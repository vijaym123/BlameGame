Congressman
Bill Foster
Representing
the 11th District
February 07, 2014
Dear
Friend,
This Valentine's Day, I am
inviting schools, groups, and individuals throughout the Eleventh
Congressional District to create a Valentine's Day greeting for a local
veteran.
We can never repay these heroes for
the sacrifices they made. This is a great chance for kids to learn about
the sacrifice our men and women in uniform make while showing our
veterans they are always in our
thoughts.
Valentine's greetings may be dropped off at any of my district offices Monday -
Friday, 9am - 5pm through Monday, February 10. Addresses and contact
information can be found
here .
Consider forwarding this email or tell your
friends and family to
sign up here
to receive
updates on the work we're doing in Washington, DC and at home in
Illinois.
Remember I am here to work
for you. If you have any questions, or concerns please feel free to
e-mail me , call our office, or connect with me on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Bill Foster
Member of
Congress
