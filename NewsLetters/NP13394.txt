Schilling hopes to raise $2 million - Galesburg Times
David -- The Galesburg Times just reported that former Congressman Bobby Schilling plans to raise $2 million in his race against Cheri for Illinois&rsquo; 17th district.
That&rsquo;s a LOT of money. But let&rsquo;s be clear about why he said this: he thinks he can win.
Schilling&rsquo;s reckless Tea Party agenda got him kicked out of Congress in 2012. Now he thinks if he just reinvents himself and backs it up with a bunch of cash he can win in 2014. Don&rsquo;t be fooled, David. Ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling is a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.
His Tea Party ideologies haven&rsquo;t changed a bit -- and his ability to raise money has never been stronger. ILLINOIS RAPID RESPONSE:
Donate $3 or more right now to support Cheri Bustos and fight back against former Congressman Bobby Schilling &gt;&gt;
$2 million is a lot of money. If Schilling is able to pull off that total, Cheri&rsquo;s reelection could be in serious trouble. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve launched a new Illinois Rapid Response Fund for Cheri&rsquo;s year-end FEC fundraising deadline.
Donate $3 or whatever you can right now to help Cheri Bustos continue to be a champion for middle class families and veterans here in Illinois. http://action.cheribustos.com/Final-Deadline
Let&rsquo;s show Bobby Schilling what we&rsquo;re made of.
