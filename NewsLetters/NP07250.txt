Friend
Every day that passes, more unaccompanied minors and illegal immigrants are flooding across our southern border. Let me cut to the chase
the crisis on our border is a direct result of prioritizing talks of amnesty over securing our border. The more politicians in Washington entertain the idea of amnesty, the more enticing crossing our border becomes.
Its time for action. We must:
1.
End the conversation on amnesty.
2.
Secure the border.
3.
Enforce our current laws.
You and I both know: Securing our border involves not just the
ability
to enforce our laws, but the
will
to enforce our laws.
I believe that this Administration has failed to demonstrate that it will enforce our laws. I will continue to
hold their feet to the fire
and to be unrelenting in our demand that they enforce the laws of this nation, as the Constitution requires them to do.
If youd like to stay up to date on my fight to secure our border and hold the Administration accountable, sign up for my immigration email updates

Yours in service,

PS - If you're not up-to-speed, here are some of the specifics of what I'm working on:
opposing the release of criminal illegal immigrants ,
demanding deportation
of illegal immigrant gang members, and opposing the Administrations actions to selectively enforce our laws and defer deportation. I
strongly support securing the border
as our first priority, and I have
opposed the closure of border patrol stations .
I believe we must empower states to protect citizens and combat illegal immigration, and I have supported
legislation to verify employment . To stay updated on these bills, sign up
