Wicker: Job Training Key to
Getting
Americans Back to Work
Congress Renews Effort
to Build Skilled U.S.
Workforce
With the long-overdue reauthorization of the "Workforce
Investment Act," the Senate has sent a strong message to American workers
about the importance of staying competitive in today's economy.
The legislation, renamed the "Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act" (WIOA), supports more efficient job training and education programs
to equip workers with the skills they need for
employment.
Millions Still Discouraged by Obama
Economy
WIOA is a rare example of bipartisan action
in Congress to put Americans back to work.
For too long Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has refused to allow a vote on
dozens of job-creating bills passed by the Republican-controlled House of
Representatives.
Meanwhile,
the Obama Economy has left millions of Americans too discouraged to
look for work or stuck in part-time jobs when they want full-time
employment.
Although the country's overall jobless rate has dropped,
the shrinking labor force is a cause for serious concern.
The
number of working-age Americans with a job is the smallest it has been
in more than 30 years.
New Legislation Streamlines Job
Assistance
WIOA accomplishes a
number of critical priorities beneficial to American workers and
taxpayers.
First, it continues job development programs tailored to
prepare a highly skilled workforce to meet the needs of U.S.
businesses.
Because of these programs, Americans are able to receive job
assistance and career training from approximately 3,000 "one-stop"
centers and 550 local workforce boards across the
nation.
Second, WIOA seeks to ensure the most
efficient use of taxpayer dollars by eliminating ineffective or
duplicative programs.
The Government Accountability Office has identified
a number of federal job training programs that overlap.
WIOA
would eliminate 15 of these programs, making job assistance less
cumbersome and confusing for Americans while also reducing government
waste.
Third, the legislation provides
more control and flexibility at the state and local levels.
Communities, citizens, and local businesses should play a central role in
determining the best ways to supply a specialized workforce for the jobs
available in the area.
Likewise, job seekers should be able to
choose the specific career services that they
need.
To do this, WIOA implements a number of
constructive reforms, including getting rid of unnecessary administrative
burdens and boosting efforts to encourage regional collaboration.
Governors, for example, would have the power to consolidate
low-performing areas and reserve a portion of funding for innovative
job-training initiatives.
Additionally, multiple state plans would be
simplified into one plan, and accountability measures would be improved
with regular, independent evaluations of
programs.
Drawing
High-Paying Jobs to
Mississippi
Ensuring America has a skilled workforce is essential to
facing the rapidly changing realities of the 21st-century economy,
including the fact that about 70 percent of today's jobs require at least a
high school education.
Capable and ready workers are a major
factor when businesses look to invest and locate in Mississippi.
WIOA can help build this workforce
and draw high-paying jobs to the
state
by fostering training that responds to skills gaps in the labor
market.
Mississippi has repeatedly shown it is a great place to
do business, and keeping this reputation means equipping local talent
with the expertise to fulfill the jobs of today and tomorrow.
