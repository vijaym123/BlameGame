Texas has been a national leader for prison reform,
finding ways to partner with faith-based and community organizations
to help prisoners change their lives instead of becoming career
criminals.
Take Brian,
for example, who fell into a crippling substance addiction and cycled
in and out of prison and parole for four years.
He relapsed over
and over again, until he joined Restoration Outreach Dallas (ROD)
Ministries' faith-based program to help criminals refocus their lives.
With their help - and lots of hard work - Brian kicked his
addiction and renewed his commitment to himself and his community.
He is
now an overseer of a ROD transitional home to help others like him.
He tutors at-risk children, volunteers at a nursing home
ministry, and is even
working towards becoming a state-registered Peer
Recovery Support Specialist.
I heard many touching success stories like Brian's when I
visited ROD Ministries in Dallas earlier this month.
There's no
question: the Texas model of prison reform is
working.
So this year, I introduced the
CORRECTIONS Act , which would allow low-risk prisoners to
participate in certain reform programs aimed at reducing their chance
of returning to a life of crime and in turn earning up to 25% of their
sentence in parole.
We
can improve our criminal justice system, save money, and ensure safer
communities if we follow the Texas
model.
I held a roundtable discussion at ROD Ministries in
Dallas this month to highlight this faith-based non-profit as an
example of the kind of program my legislation would support on a federal
level.
Earlier this month, I joined Trinity Valley Community College's
leadership for a briefing and tour of their Trinity Prison Project serving
incarcerated men currently housed at the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice's H.H. Coffield Unit in Tennessee Colony.
