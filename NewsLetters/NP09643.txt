Dear Friend:
Throughout our nations history our
liberty and freedoms have been protected and
cherished by our veterans. The sacrifices
veterans have made in defense of our nation are
of utmost importance and we should do everything
in our power to make sure that those sacrifices
are protected.
That is why I have been so concerned with
recent accounts of mismanagement and
inappropriate practices within the Veterans
Affairs (VA) Health Care System. With media
reports that such practices may have led to
patient deaths at VA facilities in Phoenix,
Arizona, I wrote to Eric Shinseki, Secretary of
the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs this
week to seek answers. In the letter I asked
a series of direct questions about policies and
procedures at the George E. Wahlen Department of
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salt Lake
City, and ten Community Clinics throughout Utah,
Idaho, and Nevada that make up the VA Salt Lake
City Health Care System.
Specifically I stated that, In the
pursuit of full transparency and proper
accounting, I would like an update regarding the
VAs current practices and
procedures. I want to ensure that veterans
in the state of Utah and throughout our country
can trust the VA system with timely and
appropriate care.
If you would like to read this letter in full,
it can be viewed

The health and welfare of our veterans is of
utmost importance to me and I will continue to
monitor this situation so that Utahs
veterans will receive the best care possible.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
