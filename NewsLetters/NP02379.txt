Dear Friend,
This month, we commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the one of the
darkest moments in the struggle for civil rights that led to one of
the movement's brightest triumphs.
On March 7, 1965, activists in Selma, Alabama,
protesting the unjust laws that prevented many African-Americans from
exercising their right to vote, were met by county and state law enforcement
officers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The brutal crackdown against the
protesters was broadcast and reported throughout the country on what
would be known as "Bloody Sunday."
But that did not stop the protesters. After Bloody
Sunday, organizers, clergy, and activists from across the nation descended
on Selma.
Led by Civil
Rights leaders like Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and my colleague in
the House of Representatives, Congressman John Lewis, the protesters
marched 54 miles
from Selma to
Alabama's capital, Montgomery. By the time they arrived on March 21,
1965, over 25,000 people had joined the
movement.
The bravery shown by these men and
women, and by others in the Civil Rights movement, continues to inspire me
today.
Last
year, I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives about another
Civil Rights activist: my father.
