Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
Giving Thanks for Our Freedom and the Bounty that We Enjoy:
Suzanne and I are very thankful to be spending this Thanksgiving in Midland with our children and grandchildren.
We are thankful for the freedom that we enjoy and grateful for the sacrifices that brave men and women have made to preserve that freedom.
We are also thankful for the farmers and ranchers who labor to produce the fiber and food that clothe and feed us.
West Texas Food Bank:
West Texas Food Bank has been helping West Texans in need for nearly 30 years. They secure donations of surplus foods and grocery products for distribution through a network of charitable organizations. The organizations they supply feed the hungry people in 19 West Texas counties. They help people who are going through rough times make ends meet until they are able to provide for themselves. We all go through rough times and the measure of man is his ability to get back on his feet.
Let us all be thankful for what we have and appreciative of people and organizations like West Texas Food Bank that are committed to helping those in need.
Libby Campbell, who is the Executive Director and an Odessa, Texas, native, showed me around their warehouse. About five million pounds of food move through this warehouse every year.
Morgan Mill Thanksgiving Celebration for Fort Hood Soldiers:
The Erath County town of Morgan Mill invites soldiers from Fort Hood to join them for a pre-Thanksgiving celebration. This is a wonderful event for the many soldiers who are unable to be with their families for Thanksgiving. The weather was great this year and after eating the soldiers played football and hung out on the playground with local kids. I am proud to represent the resident of Morgan Mill. They care deeply about the men and women who protect and defend our freedoms. Eleventh District Granbury-based regional director Diane Williams attended and took these pictures.
Mustang Well Service:
Joe Bustamante is an American success story. He is the owner of Mustang Well Service in Andrews, Texas. My district director, Evan, and I stopped at Joe's shop yesterday and saw what you would like to see: an empty lot. Mustang Well Service has nine pulling units and all of them were out on location. Joe started his business in 2007 with a little bit of money, but a willingness to work hard and the drive to succeed. He has grown his company to over 50 employees. I am going to work as hard as Joe and his employees do to make sure that we unnecessary regulations do not hamper energy production in the Permian Basin.
All of the Above Energy Policy:
This compressed natural gas fueling station that I saw yesterday in Andrews, Texas, is the first one that either my district director or I have seen while traveling through the 11th District. Apache Corporation is pushing to run its fleet of trucks on natural gas. For the sake of our economy and our national security we need to have an all of the above approach on energy.
Talking With Gerald Reid at KACT in Andrews:
I always enjoy talking with Gerald Reid at KACT in Andrews, Texas. A fine radio station in a fine town. We spoke about the agenda for the Committee on Agriculture in the next Congress. We also talked about the Endangered Species Act and immigration.
President Obama's Executive Order:
As I said on KMID Big 2 this past Friday, the President has shown himself to be untrustworthy. We can't believe him. We can't trust him. That is a stunning thing to say about the President of the United States. He has decided that the ends justify the means and that is a dangerous, slippery slope.
