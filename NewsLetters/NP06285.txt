Friend-
This week, the House voted on the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act ( H.R.2 )
a package of 13 bills
to increase domestic energy production, promote new technologies, and improve our energy security.
I believe its critical that our nation pursue its own energy resources, develop energy infrastructure projects to create jobs, and reduce the burden to American consumers.
The American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act is a step towards achieving those goals, and securing our nations future energy supplies.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I will
continue
working to expand American-made energy, encourage conservation, and decrease our dependency on foreign oil.
