Theres a wide variety of issues affecting communities here in Los Angeles and all across America. As your Representative in Washington, D.C., I'd like to hear directly from you so that I can better represent and serve our community.
Please take a moment to let me know which issues you think Congress should work on this year.

Xavier Becerra
