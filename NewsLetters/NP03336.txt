Wanted to be sure you saw that the House recently passed the Save American Workers Act ( H.R. 30 ). This bill is crucial to our job creators and hardworking employees as it repeals the Affordable Care Acts 30-hour work week definition, which is forcing some employers to cut worker hours and restructure their work force to avoid paying the costly penalty of Obamacares employer mandate. This unconventional definition has resulted in lost income for some employees, while others have lost their jobs. The Save American Workers Act takes steps to protect employees by restoring the 40-hour work week.
Moving forward, much work remains to be done to roll back the harmful impacts of the Presidents healthcare law. I will continue to advocate for the freedom of businesses to create jobs and grow their companies, as well as the opportunity for hardworking Americans to support their families, advance in their careers, and build better futures for their children.
Yours in service,
Randy

I also support the Regulatory Accountability Act, ( H.R. 185 ) to address head on the problem of the endlessly escalating, unnecessary federal regulations that are choking out our small business innovation and growth, and crippling our economy. Read the full text of the bill,
