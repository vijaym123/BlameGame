Republicans spent
millions
in secret money to buy this year&rsquo;s elections.
In fact, the midterms were the most expensive in history -- over half a billion dollars flooded our elections.
We can&rsquo;t let unfair campaign finance laws allow the ultra-rich rig the 2016 election too.
Join Cheri to demand Congress overturn Citizens United. Sign your name &gt;&gt;
We&rsquo;re working hard to end the influence of big money in politics, but David, it&rsquo;ll take an unprecedented grassroots effort to force Congress to act. Please sign our petition to end Citizens United. Supporter: David Johnson
