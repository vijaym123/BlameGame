Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. It is an honor
to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you this update on
our activities in the Second District and Washington, D.C.
Flag Day
Last Saturday our nation celebrated Flag Day and the birthday of the
United States Army. In light of this, I decided to share the story of
the flag that stands in our Washington, D.C. office. Like all
Americans, I take great pride in our nation's flag and the unity it
provides all of us. It's truly an incredible symbol of our strength and
resilience.
I hope that you enjoy the story of this flag's unique journey.
A Son and Sidekick
This week in Washington, I was blessed to have my son, Andrew,
accompany me through our busy schedule.
For Oklahomans, family and
faith are the center of life, and I think most fathers will agree that
it's always refreshing to have your kids at your side.
I know Andrew
was ready to get back home to Oklahoma by the end of the week, as I
always am, but it was great to be able to spend the time with him.
Proud to be from Oklahoma's 2nd District
First lesson of the week: the boots must always look good

Oklahomans in Washington
Once again, we had a lot of Oklahomans make the trip out to Washington,
D.C. this week.
In addition, I had the chance to visit with Oklahomans from the 51st
Annual Rural Electric Youth Tour and 4-H Citizenship Washington Focus.

Legislation Introduced to Limit Regulatory Overreach
Last week, I introduced H.R. 4866, The Lesser Prairie Chicken Voluntary
Recovery Act, which addresses regulatory overreach by the federal
government and enhances state and private sector conservation efforts
of the lesser prairie chicken.
This legislation re-establishes the proper priority role that the
states should play in taking the lead responsibility for conserving our
natural resources. Additionally, it incentivizes state government and
the private sector to create effective public-private partnerships to
protect vulnerable species with the confidence that such efforts will
be rewarded by avoiding a listing of the species.
I'm proud to help lead this effort to allow states and local
communities to protect species while simultaneously minimizing job
losses and maintaining and enhancing vibrant economic activity in their
communities.

Week Ahead
Next week I will be back in Washington for legislative business. You'll
be able to find updates on votes and other business on my website and
social media pages.
