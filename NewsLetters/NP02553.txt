Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
I am pleased to announce a series of
workshops being held throughout Nevada regarding the Rural Energy for
America Program (REAP). These workshops, sponsored and hosted by the United
States Department of Agriculture, will present an overview of
eligible REAP projects, which may provide up to 25% grants and up to 75%
guaranteed loans to agricultural producers and rural small businesses who
make energy efficiency improvements to their businesses. This year,
Nevada will receive more than $950,000 in grant funding under the REAP
program. I encourage you to attend one of the workshops below to learn
more about how this program may provide financial assistance to help
you be more energy efficient. You can find out more about the REAP
program by visiting the USDA website,
here .
