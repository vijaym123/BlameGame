Dear Friend,
I&rsquo;m excited to announce that the 2015 Congressional Art Competition has begun!
The Congressional Art Competition is an annual event held in conjunction with the Congressional Institute that highlights the artwork of high school students in Indiana&rsquo;s 7th Congressional District.
The Congressional Art Competition is open to local high school students and offers an opportunity to be recognized for outstanding artistic achievement. Students are encouraged to submit original artwork such as paintings, drawings, collages, prints, computer-generated art and photography. Once submitted, a local panel of qualified judges will select one piece of artwork that will be sent to Washington, D.C.
This artwork will represent the 7th Congressional District of Indiana and will hang in the United States Capitol for the entire year.
The first place winner will also receive two airline tickets to Washington, D.C. to attend a reception honoring artists from congressional districts across the country.
The deadline for submitting artwork is Friday, April 27, 2013 at 5:00pm.
Interested students can find more information at

or by contacting Andrea Scott at 317-283-6516 or
andrea.scott@mail.house.gov .
I look forward to seeing all the great submissions this year!
2012 Winner, Sailboats
