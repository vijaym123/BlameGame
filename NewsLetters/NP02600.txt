Veterans Job and Resource Fairs
Last October, I launched my Veterans Job Training Initiative
to support the men and women who have bravely
worn our nation's uniform as they transition from active military
service to the civilian workplace.
This March, as part of that
initiative, I'll host two veterans job and resource fairs - March 9th
in the Lowcountry and March 25th in the Upstate.
The job and resource
fairs follow a series of workshops around the state that focused on
providing veterans with various skills and information. Topics include:
how they can transfer their military skills and certifications to the
civilian world, an overview of the available educational and
entrepreneurial resources, and a resume writing and interviewing skills
workshop with a hiring manager's panel.
Banking Committee Hearing
Excessive regulation by unaccountable DC bureaucrats will mean higher
costs and fewer choices for South Carolina's consumers, especially
those buying life insurance to take care of their children and
grandchildren.
Earlier this week, I questioned Fed Chair Janet Yellen in Banking
Committee about these issues. Watch here:

LEAP ACT
On Thursday, I introduced the Leveraging and Energizing America's
Apprentice Programs (LEAP) Act with Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ).
I am
pleased to work with Senator Booker on this bill as we work to support
American families and strengthen our economy.
The LEAP Act will encourage students and those changing career paths to
earn while they learn, while also providing employers the ability to
create and enhance apprenticeship programs. The bill uses nationally
recognized SC apprenticeship program as a model to help folks. We have
seen South Carolina's manufacturing sector flourish in part due to the
hardworking South Carolinians taking part in the program.
A factsheet on the LEAP Act is available at

My Response to the President's Veto of Keystone XL Pipeline
On Tuesday, the President vetoed the Keystone XL Pipeline Act to
appease a small portion of his political base, plain and simple. The
new Republican majority sent him an energy and infrastructure bill that
enjoyed broad support among the American public, Congressional
Republicans and Democrats, labor unions and business owners large and
small.
Unfortunately, the President chose to forgo the tens of thousands of
American jobs and billions of dollars for America's economy for a short
sighted, politically motivated veto.
Allendale Fairfax High School Visit
To kick off the final week of Black History Month, I visited students
at Allendale Fairfax High School in Allendale County on Monday. I had a
great time speaking with them. They were smart young people with a lot
of potential!
