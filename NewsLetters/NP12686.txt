Salmon: School Choice Education Savings
Account Act a Good Investment
Allows more flexibility for parents in
saving for children's education
Washington-Last week, Rep. Matt Salmon (AZ-05) released the following
statement on the introduction of his newest education-focused
legislation, the School Choice Education Savings Account Act:
"Last night in the State of the Union address, President Obama said,
"Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a
child's life is high-quality early education." One of the ways we can
truly invest in our children's education is to provide parents with
more flexibility, including the expansion of tax savings accounts for
their children's education from kindergarten through college.
"As a Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I
take to heart President Reagan's invaluable words about school choice.
He said, "Choice represents a return to some of our most basic notions
about education. In particular, programs emphasizing choice reflect the
simple truth that the keys to educational success are schools and
teachers that teach, and parents who insist that their children learn."
"In honor of School Choice Week, I introduced legislation that will
offer parents the ability to use 529 tax savings accounts for qualified
K-12 expenses as well as college expenses. By offering this flexibility
to parents, they can save and invest in their students' whole education
from kindergarten through college. This will provide parents more
choices of schools, supplemental educational opportunities and
necessary equipment for their children. When parents are given greater
flexibility in school choice, children win."
Background:
Currently, the majority of states provide tax incentives for
contributions into 529 college savings plans. The federal government
allows similar incentives for educational savings for both K-12 and
postsecondary education through the Coverdell ESA program. The
Coverdell program, however limits the amount one can contribute
annually as well as the age one can make qualified expenditures. My
bill expands the language in IRC Section 529 to include K-12 qualified
educational expenses, which effectively removes such limitations. This
legislation offers parents the same tax savings for K-12 expenses that
are available for college.

Rep. Matt Salmon (AZ-05) serves on the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. He
is also a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

Salmon:
School
Choice
Education
Savings
Account
Act
a
Good
Investment
Allows
more
flexibility
for
parents
in
saving
for
children&#8217;s
education
Washington &#8212;Last
week,
Rep.
Matt
Salmon
(AZ-05)
released
the
following
statement
on
the
introduction
of
his
newest
education-focused
legislation,
the
School
Choice
Education
Savings
Account
Act:
&#8220;Last
night
in
the
State
of
the
Union
address,
President
Obama
said,
&#8220;Research
shows
that
one
of
the
best
investments
we
can
make
in
a
child&#8217;s
life
is
high-quality
early
education.&#8221;
One
of
the
ways
we
can
truly
invest
in
our
children&#8217;s
education
is
to
provide
parents
with
more
flexibility,
including
the
expansion
of
tax
savings
accounts
for
their
children&#8217;s
education
from
kindergarten
through
college.
&#8220;As
a
Member
of
the
House
Committee
on
Education
and
the
Workforce,
I
take
to
heart
President
Reagan&#8217;s
invaluable
words
about
school
choice.
He
said,
&#8220;Choice
represents
a
return
to
some
of
our
most
basic
notions
about
education.
In
particular,
programs
emphasizing
choice
reflect
the
simple
truth
that
the
keys
to
educational
success
are
schools
and
teachers
that
teach,
and
parents
who
insist
that
their
children
learn.&#8221;
&#8220;In
honor
of
School
Choice
Week,
I
introduced
legislation
that
will
offer
parents
the
ability
to
use
529
tax
savings
accounts
for
qualified
K-12
expenses
as
well
as
college
expenses.
By
offering
this
flexibility
to
parents,
they
can
save
and
invest
in
their
students&#8217;
whole
education
from
kindergarten
through
college.
This
will
provide
parents
more
choices
of
schools,
supplemental
educational
opportunities
and
necessary
equipment
for
their
children.
When
parents
are
given
greater
flexibility
in
school
choice,
children
win.&#8221;
Background :
Currently,
the
majority
of
states
provide
tax
incentives
for
contributions
into
529
college
savings
plans.
The
federal
government
allows
similar
incentives
for
educational
savings
for
both
K-12
and
postsecondary
education
through
the
Coverdell
ESA
program.
The
Coverdell
program,
however
limits
the
amount
one
can
contribute
annually
as
well
as
the
age
one
can
make
qualified
expenditures.
My
bill
expands
the
language
in
IRC
Section
529
to
include
K-12
qualified
educational
expenses,
which
effectively
removes
such
limitations.
This
legislation
offers
parents
the
same
tax
savings
for
K-12
expenses
that
are
available
for
college.
