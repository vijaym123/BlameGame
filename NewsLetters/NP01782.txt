Happy Easter and Chag
Sameach
Dear Friends,
As the Jewish members of our
community prepare their seder tables and Christian members prepare
for Easter dinner, I am reminded of the lessons each holiday teaches us
about the nature of oppression and what we can do as a community to
overcome.
Easter
is the story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, after his
crucifixion at the hands of the Romans. The miracle of the resurrection
is the most important miracle of the Christian faith. When Jesus rose
from the dead on the first Easter morning, he showed his followers
that the hope he proclaimed in his Gospel message was real, and so was
God's power at work in the world. Jesus serves as a key example that in
the face of adversity, it is through love, forgiveness, and
nonviolence, that we all wield true power, the kind that topples the
institutions of oppression and sets us all free.
Similarly, freedom from oppression is the central
theme of the Jewish holiday of
Passover . The story of
Passover commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in
ancient Egypt. As someone who has dedicated her career to public
service and helping individuals and families escape the chains of poverty, I
find this holiday particularly moving. This celebration of freedom
and family begins with the lighting of candles. As you light them, I
urge you to recommit yourself to fanning the flames of justice for those
who continue to face intolerance and persecution.
From my
family to yours, Id like to wish you a Happy Easter and Chag
Sameach.
Sincerely,
Gwen
