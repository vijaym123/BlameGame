March 16, 2014
Dear Friend,
Have you signed up for health insurance yet? If not, I have good news
and helpful information to get you started. There is still time to sign
up for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but the
March 31stdeadline is fast approaching.
Nearly 300,000 Texans have
already selected plans in the exchange and more continue to enroll each
day.
In Bexar County, thousands of uninsured folks now have the opportunity
to access quality, affordable healthcare thorough the healthcare
marketplace exchange.
These San Antonians now have access to
critically important health care coverage and can benefit from
preventative health care services, as well as have peace of mind in the
event of an unforeseen emergency.
Getting San Antonians Covered
A coalition of healthcare professionals, hospitals, Bexar County, the
City of San Antonio, and grassroots and community-based organizations,
are working hard to ensure San Antonians have the information and
assistance they need to select a healthcare plan.
They have already
assisted more than 32,000 Bexar County residents in navigating and
choosing the best healthcare plan for themselves and their families -
far surpassing the original goal of enrolling 20,000 people-and of
course there are still 16 more days left to enroll.
San Antonio Affordable Care Act Events
There will be enrollment events held throughout the city through
Monday, March 31st, including 4 events next Saturday, March 22ndto
assist folks in exploring their options and selecting a coverage plan
that is best for them.
If you can't make it to next Saturday's events, I encourage you to
check out your healthcare options before the March 31stenrollment
deadline.
Here are some helpful resources:
*	Deadline to Enroll in the Open Marketplace: March 31st
*	For more information on the Affordable Care Act, to enroll in a
plan, or find local assistance:
*	Online at: Healthcare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov
*	By Phone:
24/7 customer service center 1-800-318-2596

Restoring Emergency Assistance to Hard-working Folks
Congress must work to get Americans back to work through job creation
and supporting our workforce. On December 28, 2013, the federal
unemployment insurance program expired, resulting in 1.3 million
Americans, including 3,384 Bexar County residents and 64,000 Texans,
immediately losing their benefits.
Additionally, 72,000 Americans, and
over 4,000 Texans, are losing their benefits each week.
Congress must act to restore this critical lifeline to the folks that
need it most.
This week, I joined with 177 of my Democratic colleagues
in signing a discharge petition to bring up a vote on legislation to
renew this program that has assisted Americans and their families who
are trying to make ends meet every day.
Extending the unemployment insurance program will restore security for
folks who have worked hard, played by the rules, and continue to look
for a job.
As folks continue to look for employment and our economy
recovers we must ensure that they are supported.
Spring Visitors
Each spring brings an influx of visitors to Washington, DC that
continues through the end of summer. Families, students, and children
visit Washington as one of the top tourist destinations in the country.
And it is a great opportunity for San Antonians to stop by my office to
say hi while they are here on vacation.
I enjoy meeting with
constituents and hearing all about their time in D.C.
As you begin to plan your visit to our nation's capital, my office is
here to help ensure you have a great experience in DC.
We can arrange
tours of the U.S. Capitol and White House, give you passes to sit in
the House Gallery to watch my colleagues and me in action, or provide
information on many other popular attractions.
The U.S. House of Representatives Visitors Page
also provides helpful information on visiting
the Capitol and surrounding Washington, D.C. area.
It is a great place
to start if you are considering a visit to D.C. or don't hesitate to
call my office.
Whether you're a family with young children, college students on spring
break, or grandparents wanting to instill a little of our nation's
history in their grandchildren, Washington is a wonderful place to
visit for people of all ages.
From the 19 Smithsonian museums and
galleries and National Zoo to the millions of books housed in the
Library of Congress to the iconic monuments on the National Mall and
Memorial Park, there is something for everyone to see and do here.
>From ensuring folks have access to healthcare and emergency
unemployment assistance to meeting with constituents visiting the
Capitol, I strive to represent our community in Congress.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Avoid
tables

are
more

You

as
well
as
have
peace
of
mind

Restoring
Emergency
Assistance
to
Hard-working
Folks
Congress
must
work
to
get
Americans
back
to
work
through
job
creation
and
supporting
our
workforce.
On
December
28,
2013,
the
federal
unemployment
insurance
program
expired,
resulting
in
1.3
million
Americans,
including
3,384
Bexar
County
residents
and
64,000
Texans,
immediately
losing
their
benefits.
Additionally,
72,000
Americans,
and
over
4,000
Texans,
are
losing
their
benefits
each
week.
Congress
must
act
to
restore
this
critical
lifeline
to
the
folks
that
need
it
most.
This
week,
I
joined
with
177
of

Americans
and
their

who
are
trying
to
make

Extending
the

program
will
restore
security
for
folks
who
have
worked
hard,
played
by
the
rules,
and
continue
to
look
for
a
job.
As
folks
continue
to
look
for
employment
and
our
economy
recovers
we
must
ensure
that
they
are
supported.
Spring
Visitors
Each
spring
brings
an
influx
of
visitors
to
Washington,
DC
that
continues
through
the
end
of
summer. Families,
students,
and
children
visit
Washington
as
one
of
the
top
tourist
destinations
in
the
country.
And
it
is
a
great
opportunity
for
San
Antonians
to
stop
by
my
office
to
say
hi
while
they
are
here
on
vacation.
I
enjoy
meeting
with
constituents
and
hearing
all
about
their

in
D.C.
As
you
begin
to
plan
your

to
our
nation&#8217;s

my

is
here
to
help
ensure
you
have
a
great
experience
in
DC.
We
can
arrange
tours
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
and
White
House,
give
you
passes
to
sit
in
the
House
Gallery
to
watch
my
colleagues
and
me
in
action,
or
provide
information
on
many
other
popular
attractions.
The
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
Visitors
Page
also
provides
helpful
information
on
visiting
the
Capitol
and
surrounding
Washington,
D.C.
area.
It
is
a
great
place
to
start
if
you
are
considering
a
visit
to
D.C.
or
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
call
my
office.
Whether
you&#8217;re
a
family
with
young
children,
college
students
on
spring
break,
or
grandparents
wanting
to
instill
a
little
of
our
nation&#8217;s
history
in
their
grandchildren,
Washington
is
a
wonderful
place
to
visit
for
people
of
all
ages.
From
the

the
millions
of

housed

to
the

there
is
something
for
everyone
to
see
and
do
here.
From
ensuring
folks
have
access
to
healthcare
and
emergency
unemployment
assistance
to
meeting
with
constituents
visiting
the
Capitol,
I
strive
to
represent
our
