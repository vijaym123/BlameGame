Paid Internship Opportunities with the FBI
Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you an outstanding opportunity for college students across the nation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation will be accepting applications for its
2014 Honors Internship Program (HIP)
between
January 29th and February 4th . The 10-week program runs from June 1st to August 9th and is a great opportunity for students to work with special agents, intelligence analysts, and professional staff. Interns gain valuable career experience and many use to program to springboard to an FBI career.
Experiences like these during collegiate years are what shape lives and career paths. Internship programs provide opportunities to network and gain leadership skills. As always, I strongly encourage students who are interested to take these opportunities to complement their education with hands-on experience.
The program offers 200 paid internship positions for students in Field Offices across the country as well as in the Headquarters divisions in and around Washington, D.C.
To qualify, applicants must:
Be a U.S. citizen;
Possess a GPA of 3.0 or higher;
Be an undergraduate, graduate, or post-doctorate student who will not
graduate prior to June 1;
Be able to pass an FBI background investigation and receive a Top Secret security clearance.
Interested students can apply online at:

Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
