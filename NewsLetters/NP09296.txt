Blaine's Bulletin
In a city where the word bipartisan is heavily tossed around but rarely acted upon, I am very pleased when politics can be put to the side and the House and the Senate can agree upon job creating legislation.
Recently, the House passed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) with a vote of 412-4 that will update our nations water infrastructure. This legislation is critical to Missouri where waterways and ports support nearly 25,000 jobs and contribute $4 billion to the states economy.
As a nation, WRRDA not only strengthens water transportation networks but also streamlines the infrastructure project delivery process. In addition, Congress authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out its missions to support navigation on our nations waterways and provide flood control to protect life and property.
I am especially pleased this fiscally responsible legislation contained language that Rep. Sam Graves (MO-4) and I worked especially hard to include in the final bill. We will now ensure the Army Corps of Engineers will have a transparent, result-based strategy for fish and wildlife mitigation on the Missouri River. Another provision that I supported will ensure that our river communities are able to continue to utilize Missouri River waters without being charged by the federal government.
To note, WRRDA contains no earmarks, streamlines environmental reviews and improves coordination, and sets hard deadlines on the time and cost of studies. This legislation makes strides to increase transparency, accountability, and Congressional oversight in reviewing future water resources development activities.
As a lifelong resident of the Lake of the Ozarks area, I have a great deal of appreciation in both the economic and recreational benefits that come from Missouris fresh waters. I will continue to be an advocate for thorough water resources policy and allowing Missourians to utilize these bodies of water to the fullest extent possible.
It is my sincerest hope the House and the Senate will use WRRDA as a stepping stone and work together for the better of all Americans to enact legislation that will promote Americas prosperity and competitiveness.
