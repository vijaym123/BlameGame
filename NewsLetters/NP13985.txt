This Thanksgiving,
its easy to get caught
up in the food, football and
shopping, butits
important to not lose sight
of this days true
meaning.
To me, it means giving
back to the community that I
call home. Each year, I head
down to the Emmanuel Dining
Room in Wilmington and make
sure my neighbors are able to
partake in not only a
delicious Thanksgiving meal,
but also invaluable
fellowship.
During Thanksgiving,
lets take time to
reflect on our own lives, be
thankful for what were
lucky enough to have, and
ensure our families, friends,
and neighbors have plenty to
be thankful for as well.
Wishing you and yours a
joyous holiday season,
