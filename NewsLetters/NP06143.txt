Dear David,
Rush Limbaugh is back , tearing down women and spreading offensive misinformation.
This country is in the middle of a gravely serious conversation about how to stop the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses, and we&rsquo;re making progress in a lot of places. But earlier this week, Rush Limbaugh made this absolutely outrageous and destructive comment:
"How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that &lsquo;no&rsquo; means &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if you know how to spot it?"
Enough is enough.
As a previous target of Limbaugh&rsquo;s sexist attacks, take it from me: we need to stand together and call Rush out. The DCCC has a petition to tell advertisers to stop funding this repulsive commentary.

Rape is the number one crime committed on campuses. One in five women will be assaulted during their time at college. And right now, the weeks between orientation and Thanksgiving, is the most dangerous time for female students.
We need to take a stand. We need to stop victim-blaming, and the idea that &ldquo;no&rdquo; means &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is a BIG part of the problem.
Will you sign the DCCC&rsquo;s petition right now? Sign Your Name:

Thanks so much for standing with me,
Sandra Fluke
