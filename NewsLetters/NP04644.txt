As Veterans
Day approaches, it is important that we all take a moment to honor
Americas veterans for their service.
I am extremely grateful for the
hard work and sacrifice of the men and women who served our country
and their families.
I look forward to participating in Bransons
Veterans Day Parade this year to salute our veterans.
I am
filled with gratitude when I see our nations veterans.
These
men and women put their lives on the line to defend our freedom, and for
that we should all be thankful.
The sacrifices veterans
families made are too often overlooked.
This should not be the
case. I want them to know their sacrifices have not gone
unnoticed.
Thank you for the love and support you gave and continue to give
your loved ones who nobly served to protect us and our
freedoms.
The sacrifices our nations veterans made both at home and abroad
do not go unnoticed.
As our nation celebrates Veterans Day, I
hope we all take a moment to say thank you to a veteran for their service
to our country.
