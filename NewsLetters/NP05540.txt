Dear Friends,
One year ago this month, the Obama administration began the disastrous enactment of the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare). Since then, this unpopular and overly partisan law has regrettably failed the American people in so many ways:
President
Obama
promised
that
an average family's premiums would drop $2,500 a year. Premiums
actually
went up by thousands .
President
Obama also promised that
if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor . He later said in
an interview that, no,
there is actually no guarantee that you can keep your doctor .
He
said
the same thing about your health insurance , but in the end
millions received cancellation notices .
Healthcare.gov,
the federal exchange website, was a
complete disaster
for months last year, even after the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid's Chief Information Security Officer
recommended against launching
because of security vulnerabilities and private
consultants
cautioned that the website was broken . Today, the website is still not
completely fixed and, despite containing the sensitive personal information
of millions of Americas,
is still unsecure .
Worse, Obamacare's
broken website has already
cost taxpayers more than $2 billion .
Website
glitches may leave thousands
unable to verify their personal information
-- such as citizenship status -- putting
them at risk of losing their health care coverage.
Millions of people have
ended up on Medicaid , an insurance program that does not mean access to care
and may produce even
worse health results than being uncovered .
And,
finally, it is estimated that
tens of thousands more Americans will lose their health insurance in the coming weeks .
All Americans, especially in Western Pennsylvania, deserve
real
heath care reform, not an expensive and intrusive government mess like Obamacare. I invite you to
click here
to read about a commonsense, patient-centered alternative to Obamacare that I am currently co-sponsoring which will make health insurance more affordable and more accessible to
the most vulnerable Americans in a way that does not damage our economy
or disrupt anyone's existing coverage.
Until such a reform can pass Congress, I promise that I will remain committed to protecting all Western Pennsylvanian families -- and your tax dollars -- from the unintended consequences of Obamacare while making sure that your health care is never put at risk because of Washington mistakes.
Until health care in Pennsylvania is actually more affordable and more accessible -- and everyone's jobs are fully protected -- this fight must go on!
Sincerely,
Have a happy & safe Columbus Day weekend!
Rep. Kelly Demands Action & Answers
from President Obama
to Stop Ebola Virus
Sends letter to White House seeking explanation of
"serious and proactive strategy" to protect nation from disease
Obama administratio n health officials also contacted
Rep. Kelly sent
a letter to President Obama
on Tuesday urgently requesting information regarding the administration's handling of the recent Ebola virus outbreak and details of a comprehensive strategy to stop the virus from affecting Americans. A copy of the letter can be viewed
here .
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
"This is a Paul Revere moment for the American people. Every citizen from coast to coast should be alert, informed, and totally engaged in our nation's fight to thwart this disease. The potentially catastrophic threat posed by Ebola cannot be underestimated. Americans have every reason to be alarmed and should not hesitate to hold our federal government accountable for the actions it takes - and neglects to take. It is the government's first and most fundamental Constitutional duty to protect its citizens from harm. The time for the president to take strong, competent, and decisive action is now. When a house is burning, the sooner the water starts pouring, the better. The same goes for this virus. This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue - it is a challenge to all Americans that must be matched before it's too late."
Excerpts of
Rep. Kelly's letter
to President Obama:
I write today to express my deep concern regarding the spread of the Ebola virus and its entry into the United States. Just this past week, it was reported that Thomas Eric Duncan, who entered the United States from Liberia, tested positive for Ebola. In spite of his exposure, his travel was not stopped and he arrived in Dallas, Texas, by plane. On behalf of my constituents and the American people, I request a detailed explanation for the lack of action by your administration to prevent the spread of Ebola to our nation. I also request a thorough explanation of your administration's strategy going forward to combat the Ebola virus from becoming a global pandemic.
...
Just weeks ago, you stated that it was "unlikely" that an individual infected with Ebola would come to the U.S. Regrettably, that unlikely scenario has become a reality and our nation is in need of a serious solution. Your appraisal of the situation was likely based on the history of previous outbreaks. However, Peter Piot, who was a member of the team that discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, has stated that it has been clear to him since this past June that there is something fundamentally different about this outbreak.
...
The case of Mr. Duncan, coupled with the fatal nature and spread of this disease, demonstrates the need for a proactive and comprehensive response from the United States. For this reason, I am requesting an answer to the following questions:
A rule proposed in 2005 by President George W. Bush's administration would have empowered the federal government to detain sick airline passengers and passengers exposed to certain diseases. The rule was abandoned by your administration in 2009. Can you elucidate the rationale driving the decision to abandon the rule and address whether, in light of the case of Mr. Duncan, the 2009 decision should be reevaluated?
Does your administration have the authority, under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, to halt travel to nations on account of public health concerns? If so, does your administration think such an action would be prudent now or at some future juncture?
...
The U.S. must lead in arresting its spread while taking proactive measures to protect our nation and its people from the potential of devastating impact. For this reason, it is my position that you should utilize your authority halt all commercial flights from the affected nations until the outbreak is contained. You should also use your position of leadership to encourage other nations to do the same.It should be clear to all knowledgeable parties that containment of Ebola will not be possible as long as there is a constant flow of individuals arriving and leaving the nations that have the highest incidence.

* On Thursday, Rep. Kelly sent
a separate letter
to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS), Sylvia Burwell, and the Director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), Tom Frieden.
The letter
expresses Rep. Kelly's deep concern about the possibility of the Ebola
virus spreading to Pennsylvania, and poses the following four questions:
What communication and training has occurred between the CDC and
Pennsylvania's health care community including hospitals, local health
care clinics, urgent care centers, and physicians?
Is there a statewide call number for health care
professionals and
the public to contact if there are Ebola preparedness
concerns?
If there is an Ebola outbreak in Pennsylvania,
what is the CDC's contingency operation plans and what information have
you disseminated to the above-mentioned health care groups? Do you believe there is health care facility in
the Commonwealth that is capable of handling several infected
individuals at once or would they need to be transported to another
facility? Governor Tom Corbett was copied on the letter, a copy of which can be viewed
here .
