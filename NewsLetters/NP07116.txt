Dear Friends,
My staff and I will
host community office hours from
10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. this
coming Saturday, August 9th at Longwood High School located at 100
Longwood Road in Middle Island .
My office hours give you the
opportunity to meet with a caseworker from my office to receive
assistance with problems you may have related to Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, military and veterans affairs, passports and visas,
mortgages and foreclosures, health insurance, federal taxes, or other federal
issues.
Only residents of New Yorks first
congressional district are eligible. No appointment is necessary, but I ask
that you please RSVP if you plan to attend.
If you have any
questions or to RSVP, please call my office at (631) 289-6500.
As always, if you cannot make the event on Saturday but
require assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office.
I look forward to seeing you on
Saturday.
Sincerely,
