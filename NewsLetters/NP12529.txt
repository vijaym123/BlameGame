CBO Report Underscores Damage of
Obamacare
Last week, we learned that
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Obamacare will
lead to the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer full-time workers by 2024.
Rather than allow this disturbing fact to lower their enthusiasm for
the presidents health care law, the laws supporters are claiming
victory. They believe that individuals foregoing work because theyll have
access to taxpayer-funded health care coverage is a positive
development. We happen to disagree.
After all, the dignity of work has been at the foundation of our nation
the most innovative and productive in human history. Americans are
industrious people who for generations have climbed the economic ladder
and thus, grew our economy
through wits and work. At a time when
jobs are scarce
as evidenced by Fridays disappointing jobs report
we ought to be working together to make things better for the American
people, to help them find greater financial security so they can
support themselves and their families.
That is our charge and our focus. In the House of
Representatives, we will continue to act on policies that will encourage and empower
individuals and families toward a stronger economy, and work towards
health care solutions that positively impact the lives and livelihoods
of the American people.
