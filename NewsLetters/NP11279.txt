BREAKING: Boehner Deploys Top Deputy to Illinois
David --
Less than a week ago, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling won the Republican primary, setting up a fateful rematch against Cheri this November.
Now, Speaker Boehner is sending his top deputy to the district to host a massive fundraiser benefitting Schilling&rsquo;s coffers.
It&rsquo;s no surprise Boehner is so focused on defeating Cheri. In 2012, his political arm spent $2.2 million attacking Cheri -- all for nothing. Now he&rsquo;s trying to make good on his investment. David, we have to neutralize Boehner&rsquo;s influence. We have to get the facts out to Illinois voters and remind them about Schilling&rsquo;s Tea Party record.

While Mr. Schilling was in office, he walked out on Illinois workers, voted for Paul Ryan&rsquo;s extreme budget (two times!), and signed his name next to Todd Akin&rsquo;s on a radical bill to redefine rape.
Schilling is a
bona fide
Tea Partier -- and he has no business representing the people of Illinois in Congress.
The general election is officially underway. Let&rsquo;s make sure Cheri has what it takes to win. Chip in for Cheri:
