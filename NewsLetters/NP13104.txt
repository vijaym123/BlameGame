Dear David,
On December, 28, 2013, more than 1
million Americans lost a vital source of income when the federal
Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired. Another 1.9 million
more will lose access to unemployment insurance in the first six months
of 2014 if Congress does not act. It is shameful that Congress has not
renewed unemployment insurance and extended a helping hand to those in
need.
In late December, I made a motion in the House of
Representatives to bring a renewal of unemployment insurance up for a
vote. Although every single Democrat voted in favor of my motion, only
one Republican Member of Congress voted 'yes', which caused my motion
to be defeated. On January 9, 2014, I
made a similar
motion in the House of Representatives , and once again my attempt
to renew unemployment insurance was defeated by the House GOP.

Renewing unemployment
insurance should not be a partisan issue. In these tough economic times,
unemployment compensation is often the only source of income for
Americans who have been trying to get back to work - and back on their feet.
Furthermore, unemployment insurance is vital to preventing our
economy from sliding backwards. In 2012 alone, unemployment insurance
prevented 2.5 million people, including 600,000 children, from falling below
the poverty line. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates
that a one-year extension of unemployment insurance would create
200,000 jobs and increase our nation's gross domestic
product.
Our nation must not turn our backs on over three million Americans who
are trying every day to get back to work. I will continue my fight to
renew unemployment insurance, grow our economy and create new jobs in
Rochester and across the United States.
