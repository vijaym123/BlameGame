Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
As you know, millions of Americans have chosen to receive Medicare
benefits through the Medicare Advantage program. In fact, in 2013, the
Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 36% of Medicare beneficiaries in
Florida were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.
Unfortunately, President Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable
Care Act, included significant cuts to Medicare Advantage that the
Administration recently announced will take effect in 2015. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that $200 billion will be
reallocated from Medicare Advantage in order to pay for the Affordable
Care Act.
The impact of these cuts will very likely cause Medicare Advantage
enrollees to face higher health care costs and have significant
repercussions to the benefits they depend on. Cutting Medicare
Advantage to pay for the Affordable Care Act is not acceptable.
That is why I recently joined several of my colleagues from both sides
of the aisle to send a letter to the administrator of the Centers for
Medicare and Medicare Services urging her to eliminate the proposed
cuts. We wrote in our bipartisan letter that these cuts "are
inconsistent with our health care policy goals to promote more high
quality, coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries."
As your representative in Congress, please know that I will continue to
work to ensure that the benefits seniors deserve are protected.
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me
on Facebook
and Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not
hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.
Sincerely,
Congressman Ron DeSantis

Dear
Friend&#8211;
As
you
know,
millions
of
Americans
have
chosen
to
receive
Medicare
benefits
through
the
Medicare
Advantage
program.
In
fact,
in
2013,
the
Kaiser
Family
Foundation
reported
that
36%
of
Medicare
beneficiaries
in
Florida
were
enrolled
in
a
Medicare
Advantage
plan.
Unfortunately,
President
Obama&#8217;s
signature
legislation,
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
included
significant
cuts
to
Medicare
Advantage
that
the
Administration
recently
announced
will
take
effect
in
2015.
The
Congressional
Budget
Office
estimates
that
$200
billion
will
be
reallocated
from
Medicare
Advantage
in
order
to
pay
for
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
The
impact
of
these
cuts
will
very
likely
cause
Medicare
Advantage
enrollees
to
face
higher
health
care
costs
and
have
significant
repercussions
to
the
benefits
they
depend
on.
Cutting
Medicare
Advantage
to
pay
for
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
not
acceptable.
That
is
why
I
recently
joined
several
of
my
colleagues
from
both
sides
of
the

to
send
a
letter
to
the
administrator
of

urging

We
wrote
in

inconsistent
with
our
health
care
policy
goals
to
promote

coordinated

beneficiaries.&#8221;
As
