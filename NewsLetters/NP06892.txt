Dear Friend:
Last month, Congresswoman Susan Davis and I introduced the Survivor Outreach and Support Campus Act (S.O.S. Campus Act), legislation that would require colleges and universities to establish an independent, on-campus advocate to support survivors of sexual assault.
Yesterday, I wrote to California's public and private universities, asking them to voluntarily implement its provisions by creating an independent victim's advocate on every California campus.

As our students return to campus, they are counting on their universities not only to educate them, but also to protect them.
At a time when one in five female students has been assaulted at college, survivors of sexual assault deserve an advocate who will fight for them every step of the way.
I am working hard to pass the S.O.S. Campus Act in Congress, but our students cannot afford to wait another minute for that to happen.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
