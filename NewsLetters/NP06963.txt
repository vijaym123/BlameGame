Dear Friend, John Boehner and his Tea Party allies have made this Congress among the least productive in history.
And now, they want to sue the President just in time to rile up their base in an election year. This grandstanding instead of governing is a hallmark of the Tea Party -- and it has to stop. Join me and my colleagues in denouncing Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s absurd lawsuit.
When John Boehner&rsquo;s House isn&rsquo;t trying to sue the President, they&rsquo;re talking about impeaching him. And then when they&rsquo;re asked why they want to impeach the President, they claim the whole thing was cooked up by Democrats.
This sue/impeach the President nonsense is nothing more than election-year stunt designed to distract voters from a hard reality --
John Boehner&rsquo;s House is more interested in litigation than passing legislation.
And now, they want to spend taxpayer time and money on an utterly baseless lawsuit. Tell John Boehner and the Tea Party House that you&rsquo;re tired of their political games. Denounce the Boehner lawsuit.
Thank you.
