Make It
In America
American manufacturers are facing international competitors that benefit
from other nations carefully crafted manufacturing strategies, which
include tax incentives, investments in research, skills development
initiatives, and support for infrastructure projects in order to help
their manufacturers get ahead.
The U.S. needs to adopt a targeted
manufacturing strategy of our own.
Rep. Levin has joined with Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind and
seven other House lawmakers in sponsoring the Rebuilding American
Manufacturing Act [H.R. 2940].
This bill seeks to give the U.S.
manufacturing sector a leg up by significantly increasing the existing tax
deduction for domestic manufacturers.

Rep. Levin:
Now is not the time to cut funding for the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative.
A
bipartisan group of 46 House lawmakers, led by Rep. Levin, has joined
together to urge a key House committee to provide sustained funding
for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).
In a
letter
to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House
Appropriations panel with jurisdiction over environmental programs, the
lawmakers called for $300 million in 2015 for
GLRI.
The GLRI is a five-year-old effort
to protect, restore and maintain the Great Lakes ecosystem.
The
inter-agency program provides funding to address vital environmental
issues in the Great Lakes, such as cleaning up contaminated sediments,
reducing polluted runoff, mitigating habitat degradation and loss,
and addressing invasive species such as the Asian carp.

effectively addressing numerous unresolved issues.

Rep. Levin
Supports Cutting-Edge Medical Research
As Congress begins the budget process each
spring, Members of the House of Representatives often contact the House
Appropriations Committee to request funding in key areas.
Rep. Levin
recently joined over 180 of his House colleagues in urging the
Appropriations Committee to provide adequate funding for the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of the world's foremost medical
research centers.
In a
letter
to the Appropriations Committee, the
lawmakers state that full funding for NIH is critical if the agency is to
continue to serve as the worlds preeminent medical research
institution and our best hope for finding cures, improving treatments, and
gaining a better understanding of the complex causes of diseases that
affect millions of Americans.
