Dear Friends,
If you work with an organization that serves the public interest, whether for-profit, non-profit or government agency, my staff may be able to help you find and navigate federal services and opportunities that support your work. Many organizations in Northern Ohio would be excellent candidates for this kind of support.
Surplus Property Donation Program
The
Surplus Personal Property Donation Program
helps eligible state and local government agencies and nonprofit organizations purchase the materials and equipment that the federal and Ohio state governments no longer need. Many of these surplus items are available for a nominal payment to cover costs and can provide substantial value to community organizations that might not otherwise be able to afford them.
Items that are available most often through this program include computers, tables and chairs, cabinets, desks and other office furniture, vehicles, and many types of specialized equipment.
Eligibility:
Ohio&rsquo;s State Agency for Surplus Properties (SASP) maintains a list of organizations eligible to receive or purchase surplus items. These can include schools and other educational institutions, fire houses, hospitals and other public health organizations, police departments, elderly care organizations, municipal offices, public airports, public agencies, non-profit organizations and more. For information about this program, contact

Ohio-9th District Grants Newsletter Officially Launched!
Federal agencies regularly award financial support in the form of grants to businesses, non-profits, public-private partnership projects and local or state agencies to support their work in a variety of areas. My office is launching a new newsletter service to ensure organizations in our district are aware of opportunities that are available across many sectors. Here&rsquo;s an active grant opportunity like the ones we will be sending via the new grants newsletter:
Women&rsquo;s Business Center Initial Grant (OWBO-2015-01)
The purpose of this program announcement is to provide funding for up to six (6) non-profit organizations that are located within and will provide services to the population of Alaska, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, West Virginia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to start a new, community-based Women&rsquo;s Business Center. Eligible applicants must be private, non-profit organizations with 501(c) tax exempt status from the U.S. Treasury/Internal Revenue Service. Public non-profit organizations and for-profit businesses are not eligible for these awards.
