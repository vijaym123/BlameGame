Dear Friend,
Recently, President Obama has made headlines by threatening to take action on immigration reform
without input from Congress. Though details of any plan the president might be considering are murky, one thing is clear:
any changes made to U.S. immigration policy should NOT circumvent the U.S. Congress.
On November 4, 2014, the voters spoke loudly, put the president and his policies on notice and stripped democrats of their control of the U.S. Senate. Yet the president continues his threat to legislate by executive order. If President Obama were truly concerned about fixing our broken immigration system, he wouldnt be threatening to go around the U.S. Congress. If he truly wanted to make common sense changes to address this threat to national security, he would work with Congress. And if the president were interested in listening to the American people, he would first secure our borders and enforce our existing immigration laws.
The president has failed to earn the trust of the American people on this issue. Threatening an executive order with misguided policies is a mistake.
I will continue to monitor this situation closely, and I will continue to advocate for secure borders and common-sense immigration policy. Im listening, so why isnt the president?
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
