The House
is Leading the Way with a Full
Investigation into the Benghazi
Attack
Dear
Friend,
Like all Americans, I was devastated by
the terrorist attack responsible for the
deaths of four American foreign service
personnel stationed in Benghazi, Libya on
September 11, 2012. From the outset, my
colleagues in the House and I have been
committed to thoroughly investigating the
events that transpired on that terrible
night. During ongoing congressional
investigations into the details surrounding
the attack and its aftermath, we have
discovered that the Administration has not
been transparent nor completely truthful
with Congress and the American people
regarding what transpired that night and in
the days following.
The victims families and the
American people deserve to know what
exactly happened during the terrorist
attack in Benghazi, and we must do all we
can to provide transparency and
accountability into this tragic event in
our history.
That is why last week the
House
of Representatives approved
a long
overdue piece of legislation that would
create a select committee to investigate
the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack on
the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya which
claimed the lives of four Americans,
including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
The Select Committee will be comprised of
12 Republican and Democrat House members
and will be tasked with providing a full
and complete study of the attacks, the U.S.
response, and our efforts to bring the
terrorists to justice. Following the
investigation, a final report will be
issued to Congress.
I have
long
supported
this initiative and was a
co-sponsor of Representative Frank
Wolfs resolution creating a Select
Committee to investigate the attack. It is
my sincere hope that this measure will
allow the House of Representatives to fully
uncover all of the facts behind the
Benghazi attacks on behalf of the
victims families.
I was proud to support this important
initiative to begin a select committee
investigation focused on obtaining a
complete picture of the terrible attacks
that claimed the lives of four Americans so
we may work to ensure it does not happen
again.
