Making
Strides Toward Enhancing Our
Veterans Health Care
Dear Friend,
Like all Fifth District Virginians, I
have been deeply disturbed by recent
discoveries of unacceptable practices at
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health
care facilities. Last week, an audit of VA
facilities found that more than 57,000
veterans are still waiting for their first
appointment. We also learned that tens of
thousands of veterans wait at least 90 days
for medical care. This audit provides
further insight into the structural issues
within the agency, which have resulted in
tragic and fatal outcomes for our veterans.
These troubling findings indicate that we
must improve care for those who have made
countless sacrifices to protect our
nations freedoms.
I am pleased to report that last week,
the House
once
again took action
to address the
situation at the VA and enhance our
veterans' access to timely and effective
health care. On a bipartisan vote, the
House passed the Veterans Access to Care
Act, which directs the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs to contract with private
health care providers and allow veterans
who have experienced excessively long wait
times or live over 40 miles from a VA
medical facility to see physicians outside
of the VA system. The following day, the
Senate passed a very similar bill.
I am encouraged by the fact that the
House and the Senate have come together in
a bipartisan way to pass legislation that
will immediately enhance access to
healthcare for our veterans in the
short-term. In the meantime, we must also
continue our efforts to comprehensively
reform the VA health care system in the
long run. Much more work is needed to
change the culture at the VA to make it a
more accountable and effective agency.
Congress must also continue its rigorous
oversight of the VA to ensure that it is
implementing the necessary changes and
carrying out its mission to provide
excellent care to the men and women who
have served us so bravely.
It is my hope that by passing this
legislation, we will be able to make real
and meaningful strides toward fixing the
many problems we currently face with regard
to the care our veterans receive. I look
forward to continuing to work with my
colleagues to fulfill our commitment to
those who serve.
