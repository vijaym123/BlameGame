Dear Friends,
It is with great enthusiasm that I announce the first annual Congressional STEM Academic Competition, also known as the &ldquo;House App Contest&rdquo;, opening tomorrow, February 1. This new competition is designed to engage students&rsquo; creativity and encourage participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Representing Silicon Valley &ndash; a hotbed of innovation - has convinced me of the importance of such initiatives that promote investment in STEM education, as well as legislation like H.R. 2426, the Educating Tomorrow's Engineers Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. We must prepare our students for competitive employment in the high-tech industry and enhance American competitiveness in the global economy.
Authorized by House Resolution 77 in 2013 and based on the
Congressional Art Competition
held since 1982, this competition is a nationwide event that allows high school students from across the country to compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or &ldquo;app,&rdquo; for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice.
Throughout the completion period, participating students will be provided opportunities to engage with various STEM educational partners located within the community to mentor and assist them with their app development.
To Register

Check out which Congressional district you live in at

Provide a YouTube or VIMEO video demo explaining your app and what you learned through this competition process. All entries must be an original in concept, design and execution.
A specially selected, local panel of judges will score you on the quality of your idea (including creativity and originality), the implementation (including user experience and design), and demonstrated excellence in coding and programming skills.
The district winner or winning team, announced on May 15, 2014, will get the chance to present their apps to judges, community leaders, and me at an awards ceremony, while your app will be displayed along with each district&rsquo;s winners in the U.S Capitol in Washington, DC!
