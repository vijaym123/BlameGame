Last week, Rep. Takano resumed his "100 Businesses in 100 Days" tour,
giving him the opportunity to talk with business owners and their
employees about the business climate and their challenges.
"The Inland Empire has been hit particularly hard during the Great
Recession. With the unemployment rate peaking at 15% and one in every
fourteen homes in the region being foreclosed on, fixing our local
economy is a top priority of mine," stated Rep. Takano. "Over the next
100 days, I will visit 100 businesses and talk directly with the owners
and their employees. I want to know what their challenges are - and
most importantly, I want to know what they think Congress should be
doing to accelerate the recovery."

Rep. Mark Takano Calls for Extension of Unemployment Benefits
With legislative business ending for the year, one of the top
priorities of 2014 is extending
unemployment benefits. "Extending
unemployment insurance is crucial to our economy," Rep. Takano said.
"But if Speaker Boehner fails to act, thousands of residents in the
Inland Empire, and millions across the nation, will lose their benefits
through no fault of their own. I urge Speaker Boehner to do the right
thing and schedule a vote to restore these benefits."
