Dear Friend,
I hope you had a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. As we start out
the New Year, I want you to know I remain committed to doing everything
in my power to take the lead and convince Congress to get serious about
doing its job and finding responsible solutions that make America and
Arizona stronger.
We can begin to find these solutions this budget season. We can and
should reform our bloated and insolvent entitlement system. This past
December, I did not support the final budget deal for this reason.
Congress had a golden opportunity to get real on long-term solutions
for these programs.
Additionally, we must limit out of control borrowing that continually
adds to our national debt. We can also address the many issues that
Obamacare continues to bring to our families.
Your opinion is very important to me. In fact, the opinions of the
citizens of Arizona's 5th Congressional district are the most important
things I consider when making decisions on how to vote and what issues
to focus on this year. Please take a moment to complete the survey on
the right about what issues are most important to you and your family
that you'd like to see Congress address in 2014. Many of you have
already let me know where your priorities are and I am grateful for
your thoughts.
Because two-way communication is incredibly important to me, please do
not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of service and be sure
to sign up for my newsletter here
.
I hope you and your family are enjoying a safe and happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Updates from Washington, D.C.
Union Integrity Act (H.R. 3637)
As in other private and public sector industries, union workers should
not be forced to choose between their job or their conscience. They
should be able to shine a light on corruption or violations of their
unions' fiduciary duties, without the threat of union boss retaliation.
My bill creates whistle-blower protections for union employees. Read
more about this anti-corruption/whistleblower protection legislation
here
.
Murray-Ryan Budget
Throughout last month, I asked many of you for your thoughts on the
latest budget deal before it passed the House and Senate. Having heard
from many of you, I voted no. This was a grand opportunity for our
nation's leaders to reform and preserve the fiscal longevity of our
entitlement programs, and this deal did not rise to that challenge. We
must make big strides in the direction of a smaller and more efficient
government in order to get our country back on the right path. Read my
full statement on my vote here
.
House Foreign Affairs Committee Iran Hearing with Secretary Kerry
The agreement the State Department struck with the Iranians (P5+1)
gives them access to $7 billion in capital. In December, I asked
Secretary Kerry if he could guarantee the American people that not one
single dollar of that money will be used on an attack against US
soldiers. Watch his answer here.
A Very Public Handshake
The president's handshake with Cuban dictator, Raul Castro, represents
the first time in over 13 years a U.S. head of state has publically
greeted a dictator of Cuba. It was an insult to the people of Cuba who
are denied liberty and oppressed daily by the Cuban dictator. Read my
full statement here
.
Remembering Nelson Mandela
As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have a unique
opportunity to examine policies and politicians from around the world
and see the impact they have on their nation. Few have had more impact
than Nelson Mandela. Not easily deterred and full of hope for the
future of his country, he is quoted as saying 'I learned that courage
was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is
not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.' I hope
future generations will be encouraged by President Mandela's tenacity
to bring peace to his nation and raise awareness on issues affecting
his fellow South Africans. Read more here

>From the Fifth District
Tucson Field Hearing
Early in December, I chaired a bipartisan field hearing in Arizona that
explored our trade and security relationship with Mexico. We heard from
the Arizona and Tucson Chambers of Commerce, various think-tanks, and
heard submitted testimony from the Department of Homeland Security.
Mexico is Arizona's top trading partner with upwards of $13 billion
worth of trade crossing our shared border each year. We explored what
we need to do, both in the public and private sectors, to improve
border infrastructure to better facilitate trade without letting down
our guard on border security efforts. Thanks to Ranking Member Albio
Sires and Reps. Schweikert, Barber, and Sinema for participating in the
hearing. Click here

photo from the hearing.
Economic Development AZ-05 Meetings
Whenever I meet with constituents in my Gilbert office or at a town
hall meeting, they share with me a number of concerns. Among the top is
job creation. I will continue to meet with local leaders to collaborate
on ways to make our district attractive for business to ensure economic
growth. Most recently, I met with Vice Mayor Jack Sellers of Chandler
and other East Valley community members to get some ideas on smart
policies to spur economic development. Click here

Constituent Spotlight
Mesa teacher, Tina Harguess, recently won the Arizona Charter Schools
Association Teacher of the Year Award. Harguess has been credited with
efficient use of class room time and a willingness to give her students
individualized attention. She was honored to receive the awards and
loves what she does stating, "At other jobs, you can have an effect,
but it's an immediate effect; as a teacher, it's a lifelong effect,"
Harguess credits much of her success to the many valuable lessons she
has learned from her colleagues over the course of the last decade. A
NAU graduate, Harguess teaches the fourth-fifth grade combo class in
Arizona's Fifth Congressional District at Self Development Charter
School in Mesa. As a Member of the House Committee on Education and the
Workforce, I am grateful for quality teachers for our East Valley
students. Click here

As

from
around

impact
they
have
on
their
nation.
Few
have
had
more
impact
than
Nelson
Mandela.
Not
easily
deterred
and
full
of
hope
for
the
future
of
his
country,
he
is
quoted
as
saying
&#8216;I
learned
that
courage
was
not
the
absence
of
fear,
but
the
triumph
over
it.
The
brave
man
is
not
he
who
does
not
feel
afraid,
but
he
who
conquers
that
fear.&#8217;
I
hope
future
generations
will
be
encouraged
by
President
Mandela&#8217;s
tenacity
to
bring
peace
to
his
nation
and
raise
awareness
on
issues
affecting
his
fellow
