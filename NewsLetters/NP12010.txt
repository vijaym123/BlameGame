I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!

to take my survey on the IRS and government intrusion.
Last years IRS scandal highlighted that we must ensure that those in power cannot use their position of authority to undermine the integrity of the Republic or to intimidate those who disagree with them. That is why I was proud to vote this week in support of H.R. 2531 and H.R. 2530, legislation to help protect American citizens from government intrusion.
IRS QUESTIONING:
H.R. 2531
would prohibit the IRS from asking taxpayers questions related to their religious, political or social beliefs. I believe there is no reason for the government to need or have access to this information.
IRS AUDITS:
H.R. 2530
would require the IRS to complete individual taxpayer audits within a year of being initiated, respond to taxpayer correspondence within 30 days and disclose taxpayer information it has shared with other government agencies. There should be no long, drawn-out audits used to punish citizens for their political beliefs.
Targeting any American based on partisan means is outrageous and unacceptable.
The actions taken by the IRS were a direct threat to Americans First Amendment rights to the freedoms of speech and expression and we need to ensure that our citizens are never targeted by the government.
I want to hear from you on this important issue.
