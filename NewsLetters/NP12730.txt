Dear Friend,
The current California drought crisis demands immediate action.
Unfortunately in recent years, the federal government has chosen to put
fish before families and has ignored longstanding agreements and
policies that were designed to secure adequate water for the Central
Valley. Our local farmers and families were dealt another blow when the
California Department of Water Resources reduced State Water Project
allocations from 5% to 0% in light of the recent announcement that the
California snowpack is only 12% of its average for this time of year.
That is why I have joined with other members of the California
congressional delegation to take immediate action to address this
crisis by supporting the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water
Delivery Act (H.R. 3964), which was recently introduced in the House.
This bill would ensure that water pumps tasked with delivering water to
the Central Valley are operating at the levels agreed to in the 1994
Bay Delta Accords between California and the federal government, and
most importantly, reverses the backward policies that put the
protection of certain fish before our state's farmers and families.
Additionally, this bill would ensure that in wet years when it does
snow and rain, the resulting water is sent to those who contract and
pay for it or is used to refill our reservoirs and groundwater banks in
the Central Valley, rather than sending it out to the Pacific Ocean as
current government regulations require.
The House will vote tomorrow on this solution to the man-made water
problems in California. As the House acts, I also call on Governor
Brown to use his authority under the recent emergency declaration to
immediately direct state agencies to relax current state environmental
regulations to ensure that any available water, resulting from when
Mother Nature does start to cooperate, flows across the state and to
our communities. Water is the lifeblood of our communities, and I hope
the Senate will join us and act to provide water to Californians across
the state who are enduring another year of drought.
You can read the full bill text of H.R. 3964 here
and a
summary of its provisions here
.
Sincerely,
Congressman Kevin McCarthy

Dear
Friend,
The
current
California
drought
crisis
demands
immediate
action.
Unfortunately
in
recent
years,
the
federal
government
has
chosen
to
put
fish
before
families
and
has
ignored
longstanding
agreements
and
policies
that
were
designed
to
secure
adequate
water
for
the
Central
Valley.
Our
local
farmers
and
families
were
dealt
another
blow
when
the
California
Department
of
Water
Resources
reduced
State
Water
Project
allocations
from
5%
to
0%
in
light
of
the
recent
announcement
that
the
California
snowpack
is
only
12%
of
its
average
for
this
time
of
year.
That
is
why
I
have
joined
with
other
members
of
the
California
congressional
delegation
to
take
immediate
action
to
address
this
crisis
by
supporting
the
Sacramento-San
Joaquin
Valley
Emergency
Water
Delivery
Act
(H.R.
3964),
which
was
recently
introduced
in
the
House.
This
bill
would
ensure
that
water
pumps
tasked
with
delivering
water
to
the
Central
Valley
are
operating
at
the
levels
agreed
to
in
the
1994
Bay
Delta
Accords
between
California
and
the
federal
government,
and
most
importantly,
reverses
the
backward
policies
that
put
the
protection
of
certain
fish
before
our
state&#8217;s
farmers
and
families.
Additionally,
this
bill
would
ensure
that
in
wet
years
when
it
does
snow
and
rain,
the
resulting
water
is
sent
to
those
who
contract
and
pay
for
it
or
is
used
to
refill
our
reservoirs
and
groundwater
banks
in
the
Central
Valley,
rather
than
sending
it
out
to
the
Pacific
Ocean
as
current
government
regulations
require.
The
House
will
vote
tomorrow
on
this
solution
to
the
man-made
water
problems
in
California.
As
the
House
acts,
I
also
call
on
Governor
Brown
to
use
his
authority
under
the
recent
emergency
declaration
to
immediately
direct
state
agencies
to
relax
current
state
environmental
regulations
to
ensure
that
any
available
water,
resulting
from
when
Mother
Nature
does
start
to
cooperate,
flows
across
the
state
and
to
our
communities.
Water
is
the
lifeblood
of
our
communities,
and
I
hope
the
Senate
will
join
us
and
act
to
provide
water
to
Californians
across
the
state
who
are
enduring
another
year
of
drought.
