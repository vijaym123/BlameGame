The Four-Year
Anniversary of ObamaCare
Dear Friend:
This Sunday marks an anniversary most Utahns
would like to forget
the Four-Year
Anniversary of ObamaCare being signed into law.
Contrary to the wishful thinking of Washington
Democrats, the American people cant be
fooled. Four years later and:
Hard-working families are getting hit
with higher premiums and fewer choices.
Seniors enrolled in Medicare are now at
risk of losing their plans, benefits, and
doctors.
And, American job creators are being
forced to navigate an endless web of
bureaucratic red tape that leaves them with
less certainty and more confusion.
No matter how you spin this, its four
years later and Americans are reminded of the
failures of a misguided health law and of
countless broken promises coming out of this
White House.
Lets look at the facts:
JOB LOSS:
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) reported that the Presidents
health care law would eliminate 2.3 million
American jobs in 2021.
PREMIUM SPIKES : The Office of
the Chief Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) found that two-thirds of
Americans that work at small businesses, roughly
11 million workers, will see their premiums rise
under ObamaCare.
LOSS OF COVERAGE
: Last month, CBO reported that 7 million
employees will actually lose their
employer-sponsored coverage under ObamaCare.
I have literally heard from thousands of
Utahns and people across America who have
struggled in so many ways with the impact
ObamaCare is having in their own lives.
I have listened to your concerns and am
working hard to make health care work for
Americas job creators and families.
I have introduced legislation that would
repeal the two central pillars of the Affordable
Care Act, the
employer and
individual mandates,
and have introduced bipartisan
legislation repealing
the medical device tax that partially funds the
law.
I have also
championed legislation
to repeal the tax on job creators and their
employees. Most recently, I introduced the
Trust
But Verify Act , to delay the launch of the
exchanges, where people will buy their
Washington-mandated insurance, until the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) can
certify that the Data Hubs, the online market
place to buy insurance are secure.
I sincerely hope that President Obama and his
allies in Congress will realize ObamaCare is a
disaster and finally work with us to repeal
ObamaCare and reform our system in a way that our
citizens deserve. I know I will keep working
toward that goal.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
