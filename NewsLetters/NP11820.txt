Dear Friend,
Hope you've had a great week. Below is a summary of what I've been up
to recently.
Meeting with Veterans
Continuing my efforts to hear directly from veterans, I hosted an event
for former service members and their families on Tuesday. I was honored
to be joined at the American Legion in Portsmouth by so many veterans,
and it was great to talk with them about health care, jobs, and keeping
our commitment to veterans and military families.
I want to thank all of the service providers that helped make it a
great event: the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Red Sox
Foundation & Massachusetts General Hospital Home Base Program, Easter
Seals, and Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.
Making Housing Affordable
On Thursday, I was very happy to announce
that the Laconia Community
Land Trust
will receive a federal grant of $280,000. The funding will flow
directly to the Lakes Region and help rebuild our communities and
create jobs.
It's a smart investment in our people and our
neighborhoods.
Laconia Community Land Trust helps low and middle-income families
obtain affordable housing. To date, this great organization has helped
1,654 people in Belmont, Laconia, Meredith, Tilton, and Wolfeboro find
a place to call home.
This grant was provided by NeighborWorks, a public nonprofit
corporation established by Congress in 1978, which supports its
regional partners across the country, including the Laconia Community
Land Trust.
For every $1 invested by NeighborWorks grants, about $45
is generated in local economies.
Supporting
New Hampshire
Fishermen
This Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
announced that it will allocate almost $33 million for Northeast
fishery disaster relief. Allocating this funding and waiving the state
match requirement will help New Hampshire fishermen get back on their
feet after incredible hardships.
The fishing industry is vital to our economy, and this funding is
crucial to the livelihood of fishermen and Seacoast communities. As a
member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I have been a constant
advocate for disaster relief for the fishing industry. I also supported
the bipartisan appropriations bill, which allocated $75 million towards
fishery disaster assistance. Below is a report from the New Hampshire
Union Leader.
NH fishermen receive $32.8 million in federal relief funds
Union Leader // Wednesday, February 26, 2014
The federal government is giving $32.8 million to New England
commercial fishing communities struggling with economic losses due to
declining fish catch.
The disaster relief funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was announced Wednesday by U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen,
D-NH, U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, and U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter,
D-NH.
All of them praised the decision.
The funding represents almost half of the $75 million designated for
relief for commercial fishermen around the country, which was included
in the federal funding bill signed into law in January.
The NOAA funding announcement comes 18 months after the government
declared a fisheries resource disaster for the Northeast Multispecies
Groundfish Fishery.
"Funding recipients (New England multispecies groundfish fishery) will
have broad latitude to determine the best use of the funds to meet the
unique needs of their local businesses and communities," according to
NOAA. "Funds can be used for activities that, 'restore the fishery or
prevent a similar failure in the future, and to assist a fishing
community affected by such failure.'"
Through the allocation process, NOAA Fisheries works with recipients to
developing spending plans and ensure that requirements are met.
Keeping Manchester Airport Safe
I am concerned about a proposal to close the Manchester Air Traffic
Control Tower between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. I, along with
the entire New Hampshire Congressional delegation, sent a letter to the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday urging that the tower
remain open during those hours.
The proposed closure would pose serious safety concerns for the
aircraft and airport personnel that rely on this tower, because
Manchester Airport (MHT) is designated as a diversion airport for New
England. During the night, MHT receives non-designated operations.
These diversions are especially frequent during times of severe
weather, which have occurred during this harsh winter. You can read the
full letter here
.
Meeting Granite Staters
I had a busy week in Washington. I was happy to see so many people from
New Hampshire and discuss issues that matter to our state.
I enjoyed meeting with members of the New Hampshire Association of
Broadcasters to discuss the important services they provide to our
communities.
Happy to meet with Morgan and Alex from New Hampshire to discuss how
they manage hemophilia. They are great advocates for the research
funding and support that kids in NH need!
Met with representatives from the NH YMCA to talk about diabetes
prevention and support for youth in our communities. Thanks for
visiting, James and Paul!
A big thank you to Environment New Hampshire for keeping Granite
Staters talking about clean air and clean water!
Great to meet with conservation delegates from the Garden Club of
America. These dedicated NH women are working hard for our environment!
As always, please keep in touch about the important issues facing our
country and our state. My office is here to serve you!
Best wishes,
Carol

The
federal
government
is
giving
$32.8
million
to
New
England
commercial
fishing
communities
struggling
with
economic
losses
due
to
declining
fish
catch.
The
disaster
relief
funding
from
the
National

was
announced
Wednesday
by
U.S.
Sen.

Kelly
Ayotte,
R-NH,
and
U.S.
Rep.
Carol
Shea-Porter,
D-NH.
All
of
them
praised
the
decision.
The
funding
represents
almost
half
of
the
$75
million
designated
for
relief
for
commercial
fishermen
around
the
country,
which
was
included
in
the
federal
funding
bill
signed
into
law
in
January.
The
NOAA
funding
announcement
comes
18
months
after
the
government
declared
a
fisheries
resource
disaster
for
the
Northeast
Multispecies
Groundfish
Fishery.
&#8220;Funding

(New

determine
the
best
use
of
the
funds
to
meet
the
unique
needs
of
their
local
businesses

according
to
NOAA.
&#8220;Funds
can
be
used
for
activities
that,
&#8216;restore
the
fishery
or
prevent
a
similar
failure
in
the
future,
and
to
assist
a
fishing
community
affected
by
such
failure.&#8217;&#8221;
Through
the
allocation
process,
NOAA
Fisheries
works
with
recipients
to
developing
spending
plans
and
ensure
that
requirements
are
met.
Keeping
Manchester
Airport
Safe
I
am
concerned
about
a
proposal
to
close
the
Manchester
Air
Traffic
Control
Tower
between
the
hours
of
midnight
and
6:00
a.m.
I,
along
with
the
entire
New

Congressional
delegation,
sent
a
letter
to
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
on
Thursday
urging
that
the
tower
remain
open
during
those
hours.
The
proposed
closure
would
pose serious
safety
concerns
for
the
aircraft
and
airport
personnel
that
rely
on
this
tower,
because
Manchester
Airport
(MHT)
is
designated
as
a
diversion
airport
for
New
England.
During
the
night,
MHT
receives
non-designated
operations.
These
diversions
are especially
frequent
during
times
of
severe
weather,
which
have
occurred
during
this
harsh
winter. You
