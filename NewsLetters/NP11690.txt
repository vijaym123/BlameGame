Dear Friend:
Insanity is doing the same
thing over and over again and expecting different results. This week
House Republicans made their 50th attempt to repeal or undermine the
Affordable Care Act. This insanity has to stop. It's time to raise the
federal minimum wage, extend unemployment insurance and pass
comprehensive immigration reform that will grow the economy by $1.4 trillion
over the next decade.
President
Obama's 2015 Budget:
On Tuesday, President Obama sent
Congress a budget proposal for fiscal year 2015 that includes more generous
tax breaks for working families while scaling back breaks for the
rich. I was particularly pleased because the budget calls for an extension
of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). In the previous week I
introduced the EITC for Childless Workers Act, which would extend the
program to low-income single workers without children. Expanding the EITC
will not only reduce poverty, but also promote work and stimulate
economic growth. In Congress, I will continue to uphold the President's
vision to provide everyone the opportunity to succeed in
America.
Helping out-of-work New
Yorkers:
The US Department of Labor announced that the economy added
175,000 jobs in February. For four years now, we've seen uninterrupted
growth in private-sector employment. However, there's more to be done to
help people suffering from long-term unemployment. That's why
I held a conference call with multiple top employers
in
our District to discuss strategies and best practices that can help
people get hired.
Womens History
Month: During Womens History Month it's important that we
recognize the tremendous progress women have made in various fields of
society. I signed on to the Womens Bill of Economic Rights to remain an
active champion for women's equality. I also support Leader Pelosi's
efforts to advance "When Women Succeed, America Succeeds," a Democratic
economic agenda that addresses the need to ensure that women get
equal pay for equal work. In Congress I will keep fighting to advance
legislation and initiatives that empower women in our community to
succeed.
