THE BECERRA BULLETIN
BY THE NUMBERS: RAISE THE WAGE
Every hardworking American deserves a fair and living wage. Democrats in the House of Representatives have introduced legislation, the Raise the Wage Act (H.R. 2150), that would raise the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020. Here's a look at the impact of raising the wage:
- Raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 will give
more than 35 million American workers
a pay increase.
- Nationally, more than
19 million women,
nearly 1 out of every 3 women workers, would get a pay raise if the Raise the Wage Act became law.
-
3.8 million workers
in California would benefit by raising the wage.
-
Over 2 million children
in California have parents who would benefit by raising the wage.
