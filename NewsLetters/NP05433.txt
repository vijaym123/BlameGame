David -- This is the biggest fundraising comeback of the year:
Since we unlocked the Triple-Match earlier this morning, over 18,OOO Democrats have stepped up and donated. And now all of those gifts have been tripled!
Keep in mind, this is the same day Boehner and his billionaire allies are launching a record breaking assault on our Democratic candidates -- more than $17,OOO,OOO is being spent this week.
David, the Triple-Match is exactly the boost we needed to knock Boehner back on his heels.
Will you make a Triple-Matched donation of $5 or more right now to help us complete this epic comeback? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Speaker Boehner was riding high this morning, but he's going to have an absolute meltdown if the Triple-Match lets us come all the way back to close the gap. Now let's make it happen: http://action.dccc.org/Match-Deadline
