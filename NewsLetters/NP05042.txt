David -- We have a MAJOR problem. And only a few hours left to find a solution. Please read this immediately:
It&rsquo;s now official that Boehner&rsquo;s allies will spend $25 MILLION this week against Democrats -- the most of the entire election. They&rsquo;re going all out to crush us in the final days of the election -- and it&rsquo;s working.
Polls all around the country show that Republicans&rsquo; Obama-bashing TV ads are taking their toll on our Democratic candidates. We&rsquo;ll be blunt: Today is our last chance to turn things around.
The final week ad buy deadline is tonight at MIDNIGHT. If you&rsquo;re reading this email right now, we need your help. David -- Please step up before the FINAL ad buy deadline tonight.
