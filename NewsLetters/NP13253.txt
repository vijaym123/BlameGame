Blaine's Bulletin
As we welcome in the New Year, our minds often go to the notion of a new beginning. It is a time of hope and ambition and resolutions - and Congress is no different. It is no secret that recent polls have made it clear that Americans are not happy with the gridlock in Washington.
Whether it's on the streets of the 3rd Congressional District or via social media, people are demanding action on a variety of issues and it often surprises folks when I tell them that as far as the House is concerned, we have been busy passing important legislation.
But I cannot argue with facts. In the last Congress, only 52 bills were passed by both chambers, which are the lowest totals in American history, but it wasn't for a lack of trying by the House of Representatives. In fact, my colleagues and I passed nearly 150 bills that would help our economy and boost jobs.
The House passed spending proposals that cut what government spends in an ongoing effort to put our country back on a path to fiscal responsibility. We passed legislation to construct the Keystone XL Pipeline that would create thousands of jobs and further reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We passed several proposals to enact tax reforms to ensure that Americans get to keep more of the hard-earned money. And we voted on several measures designed to do away with the president's health-care law.
Unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled Senate refused time and again to take up our legislation. In fact, they didn't even take the time to discuss or negotiate these substantial proposals. They flat turned down our efforts on behalf of the American people, in keeping with the president's mantra of it's my way or the highway.
While I can understand your frustration with the system, we must remember that our founding fathers created a system of government in which the House and Senate would have to agree in order to get things done. They did not believe that it was supposed to be easy to create laws. These great patriots also believed that reasonable people could come to a compromise on issues important to the American people despite sharp differences in opinion.
For some time now, however, Washington Democrats have made it clear that the last thing they want to do is compromise and that is disheartening. We have to understand that neither Democrats nor Republicans will get everything they want in a divided government but that it is our duty to do what is best for the American people.
As we begin 2014, I remain hopeful that things will change and, in fact, there was some progress made in late 2013 when the House, on a significant bi-partisan vote, passed a budget that not only held the line on taxes but also reduces spending. It was not a perfect agreement by any means, but it was a good, small first step since we now at least have our budget process back on track after years of stalemate and confusion.
As always, I will continue to listen to the people like you who sent me to Washington to do what's best for the people of the 3rd District and our nation. It is time for the Senate to step up and work with us just as our founders envisioned and people like you have demanded.
