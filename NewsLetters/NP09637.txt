Are hiring tax credits good for America's small businesses?
Yes - They incentivize businesses to hire workers and grow our economy
Maybe - Not enough businesses know that hiring tax credits exist
No - The cost of the tax credits will only add to our deficit

One of the most important roles that Congress has as part of the
Constitution's system of checks and balances is the investigative
oversight of the Executive Branch. However, this oversight role must be
conducted in a fair and transparent manner, or there is the risk of
trivializing and marginalizing any future exercise of this oversight
role.
Last week, the House of Representatives voted on a resolution that
would establish a "Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012
Terrorist Attack in Benghazi."
I agree that we should resolve any unanswered questions about Benghazi,
but the investigation must be fair and the results transparent. The
newly-formed Select Committee should include an equal number of
Democrats and Republicans working together to ensure the bipartisan
review of every single piece of evidence. I voted against the Select
Committee resolution because it did not meet this criteria.
If we truly want to move beyond this issue, we must have a reasonable
and bipartisan effort to obtain the facts. The American people deserve
nothing less.
Recap: Service Academy Night In Cypress
I was honored to host a Service Academy Night in Cypress on Wednesday.
It was great to meet with more than 50 parents and their high school
students who are interested in attending our nation's prestigious
military service academies.
My office helps nominate distinguished and outstanding high school
students from across our district to attend one of our nation's service
academies. I encourage you to learn more about service academy
nominations by visiting:

Dedication to U.S. Coast Guard Officer Terrell Horne III
I was honored to attend the naming dedication of the U.S. Coast Guard
(USCG) building in San Pedro for heroic USCG Senior Chief Petty Officer
Terrell Horne, III who sacrificed himself to save fellow crewmembers
during a counter-smuggling operation off the coast of California in
2012. It is a little overwhelming to hear the story of such great
courage and such devotion to others. It must be said again, he
disregarded his own safety in order to protect his fellow crew members.
You can read more about the naming dedication by clicking here.

posthumous awarding of the Coast Guard Medal to CPO Horne by clicking

A Strong Voice For Asian Pacific Americans
The Asian Pacific American community is one of the fastest growing
communities in our nation. For two decades, the Congressional Asian
Pacific American Caucus has served as one of this community's strongest
voices in Congress and I am proud to celebrate their 20th anniversary
this week. I continue to be impressed by CAPAC's commitment to key
issues important to the Asian Pacific American community like
immigration reform, helping small business, and accessible and
affordable health care.
I know that CAPAC will continue to thrive and
succeed as an advocate for Asian Pacific American communities across
our country. As the representative of many different Asian Pacific
Islander communities in California's 47th District, I look forward to
continuing to work with CAPAC on issues important to these communities.
National Small Business Week
This week marks National Small Business Week. Here's to the 47th
District's small businesses and all that they do to keep our local
economy strong.
Entrepreneurs and small businesses not only embody the spirit of the
American Dream, they drive our local and national economies.
I am proud to represent a district that fully embodies the hard work
and innovation that have been so integral to the economic development
of our country.
As a member of the bipartisan Congressional Small Business Caucus, I am
committed to making sure we invest in the drivers of our nation's
economy, especially our small businesses, to give Americans the tools
they need to succeed and help grow our economy.
I believe that the more Congress is able to focus on empowering small
businesses to hire, the more we will able to transition Americans from
unemployment, while creating thousands of jobs and saving millions of
taxpayer dollars.
This is why I introduced the "American Unemployed Worker Investment
Act," this past December.
At the core of this legislation is a $4,000 hiring tax credit for small
businesses nationwide. By incentivizing small businesses with 11-25
employees with a $4,000 per new employee tax credit for hiring people
who are currently receiving unemployment benefits, I believe we can
promote job growth, as well as realize savings in our federal
unemployment benefit program.

Electronic Voting in the House
Most recorded and roll call votes on the floor of the House, unless the
Speaker of the House chooses a different method, are conducted
electronically. Every Congress Member is provided with a personalized
and unique Vote-ID Card which can be used to vote electronically. Vote
stations are positioned at various locations on the floor of the House
chamber.
Each vote station has a slot into which the voting card is inserted and
is equipped with buttons marked "yea," "nay," and "present." The
stations also have an "open" light, which is lit when a vote is in
progress and the card station is ready to accept votes. Members vote by
inserting the voting card into the card slot and pressing the
appropriate button to indicate the Member's choice.
Members, if they wish to skip the electronic voting system, can submit
their physical vote on a paper ballot to the Tally Clerk, who then
records the vote electronically according to the indicated preference
of the Member. Like the buttons on the electronic card stations, the
paper ballots are green for "yea," red for "nay," and amber for
"present."
The first electronic votes on the floor were held January 23, 1973.
Do you think there should be a Select Committee on Benghazi?

Benghazi

equal number of Democrats and Republicans working together to ensure
the bipartisan review of every single piece of evidence

A
Strong
Voice
For
Asian
Pacific
Americans
The
Asian
Pacific
American
community
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
communities
in
our
nation.
For
two
decades,
the
Congressional
Asian
Pacific
American
Caucus
has
served
as
one
of
this
community&#8217;s
strongest
voices
in
Congress
and
I
am
proud
to
celebrate
their
20th
anniversary
this
week.
I
continue
to
be
impressed
by
CAPAC&#8217;s
commitment
to
key
issues
important
to
the
Asian
Pacific
American
community
like
immigration
reform,
helping
small
business,
and
accessible
and
affordable
health
care.
I
know
that
CAPAC
will
continue
to
thrive
and
succeed
as
an
advocate
for
Asian
Pacific
American
communities
across
our
country.
As
the
representative
of
many
different
Asian
Pacific
Islander
communities
in
California&#8217;s
47th
District,
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
work
with
CAPAC
on
issues
important
to
these
communities.
National
Small
Business
Week
This
week
marks
National
Small
Business
Week.
Here&#8217;s
to
the
47th
District&#8217;s
small
businesses
and
all
that
they
do
to
keep
our
local
economy
strong.
Entrepreneurs
and
small
businesses
not
only
embody
the
spirit
of
the
American
Dream,
they
drive
our
local
and
national
economies.
I
am
proud
to
represent
a
district
that
fully
embodies
the
hard
work
and
innovation
that
have
been
so
integral
to
the
economic
development
of
our
country.
As
a
member
of
the
bipartisan
Congressional
Small
Business
Caucus,
I
am
committed
to
making
sure
we
invest
in
the
drivers
of
our
nation&#8217;s
economy,
especially
our
small
businesses,
to
give
Americans
the
tools
they
need
to
succeed
and
help
grow
our
economy.
I
believe
that
the
more
Congress
is
able
to
focus
on
empowering
small
businesses
to
hire,
the
more
we
will
able
to
transition
Americans
from
unemployment,
while
creating
thousands
of
jobs
and
saving
millions
of
taxpayer
dollars.
This
is
why
I
introduced
the
&#8220;American
Unemployed
Worker
Investment
Act,&#8221;
this
past
December.
At
the
core
of
this
legislation
is
a
$4,000
hiring
tax
credit
for
small
businesses
nationwide.
By
incentivizing
small
businesses
with
11-25
employees
with
a
$4,000
per
new
employee
tax
credit
for
hiring
people
who
are
currently
receiving
unemployment
benefits,
I
believe
we
can
promote
job
growth,
as
well
as
realize
savings
in
our
federal
unemployment
benefit
program.
