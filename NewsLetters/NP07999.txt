What Do You Think? President Obama has requested $3.7 billion in additional
funding to address the influx of illegal immigration on the Texas
border. Using the Department of Homeland Securitys estimate that 52,000
children have crossed the border illegally since October, this proposal
amounts to more than $70,000 per child. Do you think Congress should approve the
Presidents spending request? Yes No Are there other
