Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays!
Dear Friends,
Like many of you, I've been busy trimming the tree, doing some last minute shopping, and wrapping those last few gifts.
And with two young kids at home, I can't wait for Christmas morning.
It's always an exciting time at our house.
But Christmas is about so much more than presents under the tree.
It's a season of giving and goodwill. And it's a special time to reflect on our many blessings as Americans.
We're fortunate to live in the greatest nation on Earth. And I'm especially grateful to our brave servicemen and women for giving us the greatest gift of all - our freedom.
As they serve far from home this holiday season, they and their loved ones are in our prayers.
As 2014 comes to a close and we look forward to the new year, may your holiday be filled with the blessings of family, friends, and faith.
From my family to yours, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy, healthy New Year.
Warm Regards,
Kelly Ayotte
United States Senator
