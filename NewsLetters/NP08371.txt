Dear Friend,
In Congress, I am honored to represent you and to serve alongside a
true American hero: Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, a member of the
"Big Six" Civil Rights leaders.
Last weekend, I welcomed Congressman Lewis to Long Island where he
visited the First Baptist Church in Glen Cove and received a warm
welcome from our community. I was especially proud to introduce him to
two leaders in our community, Reverend Roger C. Williams and Reverend
Craig J. Wright, pictured here.
The weekend of Congressman Lewis' visit to New York marked the 50th
anniversary of the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi
- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner. One was a young
black man; the other two were white men from New York. They had been
working during Freedom Summer to register black voters in Mississippi
and were investigating the burning of a church. Their tragic murder
awakened the nation to the violence of racism.
Those murders serve as a reminder of the dangers Congressman Lewis
faced and the solemn duty we have to oppose to any and all forms of
prejudice. Congressman Lewis described to us his upbringing in rural
Alabama, where Jim Crow laws legalized racial discrimination and where
his church was attacked by the Ku Klux Klan. It spurred him to become
involved in the Civil Rights movement, joining the Freedom Riders and
ultimately rising to become president of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, where he worked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
to fight against discrimination.
I believe it is important for as many Americans as possible to take
part in the democratic process by voting. It is our right as citizens.
That is why I have been proud to work in concert with Congressman Lewis
to fight for equality. I joined him in cosponsoring the Voter
Empowerment Act to ensure that all eligible voters have equal access to
the ballot box and combat discriminatory voting laws. I have also
introduced legislation like the Weekend Voting Act to make it more
convenient for more Americans to vote.
I will continue to fight for common-sense policies to ensure more
Americans can vote and continue fighting for equality for all people,
regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.
Thank you,
Steve Israel

2014 Dear
Friend,
In
Congress,
I
am
honored
to
represent
you
and
to
serve
alongside
a
true
American
hero:
Congressman
John
Lewis
of
Georgia,
a
member
of
the
&#8220;Big
Six&#8221;
Civil
Rights
leaders.
Last
weekend,
I
welcomed
Congressman
Lewis
to
Long
Island
where
he
visited
the
First
Baptist
Church
in
Glen
Cove
and
received
a
warm
welcome
from
our
community.
I
was
especially
proud
to
introduce
him
to
two
leaders
in
our
community,
Reverend
Roger
C.
Williams
and
Reverend
Craig
J.
Wright,
pictured
here.
The
weekend
of
Congressman
Lewis&#8217;
visit
to
New
York
marked
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
murders
of
three
civil
rights
workers
in
Mississippi
-
James
Chaney,
Andrew
Goodman,
Michael
Schwerner.
One
was
a
young
black
man;
the
other
two
were
white
men
from
New
York.
They
had
been
working
during
Freedom
Summer
to
register
black
voters
in
Mississippi
and
were
investigating
the
burning
of
a
church.
Their
tragic
murder
awakened
the
nation
to
the
violence
of
racism.
Those
murders
serve
as
a
reminder
of
the
dangers
Congressman
Lewis
faced
and
the
solemn
duty
we
have
to
oppose
to
any
and
all
forms
of
prejudice.
Congressman
Lewis
described
to
us
his
upbringing
in
rural
Alabama,
where
Jim
Crow
laws
legalized
racial
discrimination
and
where
his
church
was
attacked
by
the
Ku
Klux
Klan.
It
spurred
him
to
become
involved
in
the
Civil
Rights
movement,
joining
the
Freedom
Riders
and
ultimately
rising
to
become
president
of
the
Student
Nonviolent
Coordinating
Committee,
where
he
worked
with
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
to
fight
against
discrimination.
I
believe
it
is
important
for
as
many
Americans
as
possible
to
take
part
in
the
democratic
process
by
voting.
It
is
our
right
as
citizens.
That
is
why
I
have
been
proud
to
work
in
concert
with
Congressman
Lewis
to
fight
for
equality.
I
joined
him
in
cosponsoring
the
Voter
Empowerment
Act
to
ensure
that
all
eligible
voters
have
equal
access
to
the
ballot

and
combat
discriminatory
voting
laws.
I
have
also
introduced
legislation
like
the
Weekend

to
make
it
more
convenient
for
more
Americans
to
vote.
I
will

to
ensure
more
Americans
can
vote
and
continue

for

for
all
