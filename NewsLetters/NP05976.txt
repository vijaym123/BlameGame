Are you online, david? I really need you to read this:
-- Boehner just launched a $4.8 MILLION assault on the Illinois airwaves.
-- he&rsquo;s determined to defeat strong Democrats like Cheri Bustos.
-- and we&rsquo;re running out of time to close the gap. Look, there&rsquo;s nothing else to say.
If we don&rsquo;t help Cheri fight back, Democrats could lose Illinois&rsquo; 17th district for a decade.
And that would be heartbreaking.
Look, I don&rsquo;t need you to hand over your life&rsquo;s savings, but I do need you to chip in $5 or more to Cheri&rsquo;s campaign today -- before Boehner&rsquo;s lies take hold. All Gifts Matched Through Midnight Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I refuse to have any regrets.
