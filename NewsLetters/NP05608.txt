Reforming
the Tax Code and Allowing Small Business
to Grow
Dear Friend,
As I traveled along Route 58 recently,
touring a variety of manufacturing
companies, I talked with small business
owners and working Virginians about the
biggest issues for success in their
businesses. Route 58 is one of the two main
arteries of Virginias Fifth
District, and has a proud history of
manufacturing as it connects Southside
Virginia directly to the Port of Virginia,
making it a strategic area for
manufacturers to locate their businesses.
Unfortunately, many communities along Route
58 continue to experience significantly
higher unemployment than other areas of
Virginia.
As I have heard so many times before,
the Fifth District Virginians I spoke with
told me about their grave concerns
regarding unemployment and the need for
policies that help Main Street, small
businesses, family farms, and
Virginias working families by
reducing unnecessarily burdensome
regulations, and making it easier to do
business.
Among the significant concerns impacting
Fifth District businesses and their ability
to invest in their communities is
Washington's complex and outdated tax code,
which continues to stifle small
businesses ability to grow their
operations and create jobs. In the House,
we remain committed to reforming the
outdated corporate tax code, which has the
unfortunate distinction of being among the
highest rates in the world.
As part of
the
bipartisan Jobs for America Act , the
House also recently passed Americas
Small Business Tax Relief Act to ensure
that our small businesses have the
certainty they need to grow their
businesses. This legislation would make
permanent a tax provision that allows small
businesses to expense certain investments
in new equipment and property each year. By
permanently allowing these small businesses
to deduct up front the costs of purchasing
new equipment and property expenses each
year, we are strengthening our economy by
making it easier for them to invest back
into their businesses. This also relieves
these vital job creators from some of their
tax compliance costs, which are 65% higher
than those of big businesses.
Americas Small Business Tax
Relief Act is a vital step forward, but it
is just a small part of what we need to do
to reform our reform to free our Main
Street businesses from government-created
obstacles to economic growth. I look
forward to continuing to work with my
colleagues to foster the success of our
small businesses so that they can create
jobs and generate opportunity and
prosperity for our communities.
