Congressman Lamborn
Supports Terrorism Risk and Business
Legislation
1/7/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted for the Terrorism
Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. This
bill reauthorizes the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) of 2002 for six
years and provides a government reinsurance backstop for acts of
terrorism. The Congressman also supported the Promoting Job Creation and
Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. This bipartisan bill packages
together multiple pieces of legislation designed to repeal some of the
regulations implemented by the Dodd-Frank
Act.
"The new Congress is standing up and supporting
businesses and employers large and small across the nation. The House has
worked together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that we provide
insurance against terrorist attacks in a way that is less burdensome on
tax payers and more stable for our economy. We also passed a package of
eleven, common-sense pieces of regulatory reform designed to roll back
the most excessive and unnecessary regulations put in place by
Dodd-Frank. These reforms will allow our economy to rebound from the
ground-up, not utilizing a heavy-handed approach from Washington
DC."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
