As we begin hurricane season, I wanted to share with you some tips and resources to assist you in both preparing and informing yourself, so that you can help keep yourself, your family, and our communities safe.
Here are a few ways to ensure that your family is prepared for hurricane season :
Prepare an emergency kit of supplies: three days of bottled water and non-perishable food; a battery-powered and/or hand-crank radio with extra batteries to hear emergency information.
Other items to include are flashlights and extra batteries, a first aid kit, and an extra supply of prescription medicines.
Write a family emergency plan that includes out-of-town contacts and locations to reunite if you become separated.
For more information on making a family plan, go to
www.ReadyVirginia.gov .
Steps to take in the event of an incoming hurricane:
Constantly listen to the radio or television for instructions to evacuate the area.
Prepare your home by covering windows with steel or wooden storm shutters.
Make sure every family member wears or carries identification.
Turn your refrigerator and freezer to the maximum settings and keep them closed in case of power outages.
Turn off propane tanks.
Shut off other utilities if emergency officials advise you to do so.
