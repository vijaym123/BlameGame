The numbers speak for themselves. Out of 435 Members of Congress, only 17 have voted against all stimulus under both Presidents Bush and Obama.
I am proud to be one of the 17.
We cannot spend our nation out of debt, or tax our way to prosperity. Its principles not partisanship.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Washington needs to be held directly accountable for overspending. Thats why I introduced a bill to tie Members salaries to government spending
the more they spend, the less they make. Learn more about my efforts to cut wasteful spending and solve Washingtons dysfunction,
