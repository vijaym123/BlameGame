Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
November is National Adoption Month, a month focused on raising
awareness of the thousands of children waiting to find permanent,
loving families. Deciding to adopt a child is one of the most caring
and important decisions any family could make. It's also the beginning
of a process that's too often far more difficult than it should be.
This is especially true when families decide to adopt a child from
another country. Many families are deterred entirely from adopting
internationally because they face mountains of bureaucratic red tape.
It doesn't have to be this way, and I've been working hard to make sure
families across our state and our country have the opportunity to open
their homes to more children.
That's why I'm strongly supporting a bipartisan bill currently working
its way through Congress called the Children In Families First Act,
which streamlines the international adoption process.
And just yesterday, I met with Jonathan and Kayla Craig, of Orange
City, who adopted their son Joseph from Nigeria two years ago. Although
their adoption almost fell through due to red tape, we were able to
help the Craigs navigate the barriers put in place by the US and
Nigerian governments and finally bring Joseph here to Iowa.
Watch this short news clip on WOI-TV about their story:
Watch the video!
I believe that more families would open their homes to more children,
like the Craigs, if international adoption was a smoother and more
predictable process. And it's my hope that my colleagues in the US
House and Senate support this important legislation.
All the best,
Bruce

David,
November
is
National
Adoption
Month,
a
month
focused
on
raising
awareness
of
the
thousands
of
children
waiting
to
find
permanent,
loving
families.
Deciding
to
adopt
a
child
is
one
of
the
most
caring
and
important
decisions
any
family
could
make.
It's
also
the
beginning
of
a
process
that&#8217;s
too
often
far
more
difficult
than
it
should
be.
This
is
especially
true
when
families
decide
to
adopt
a
child
from
another
country.
Many
families
are
deterred
entirely
from
adopting
internationally
because
they
face
mountains
of
bureaucratic
red
tape.
It
doesn't
have
to
be
this
way,
and
I've
been
working
hard
to
make
sure
families
across
our
state
and
our
country
have
the
opportunity
to
open
their
homes
to
more
children.
That's
why
I'm
strongly
supporting
a
bipartisan
bill
currently
working
its
way
through
Congress
called
the
Children
In
Families
First
Act,
which
streamlines
the
international
adoption
process.
And
just
yesterday,
I
met
with
Jonathan
and
Kayla
Craig,
of
Orange
City,
who
adopted
their
son
Joseph
from
Nigeria
two
years
ago.
Although
their
adoption
almost
fell
through
due
to
red
tape,
we
were
able
to
help
the
Craigs
navigate
the
barriers
put
in
place
by
the
US
and
Nigerian
governments
and
finally
bring
Joseph
here
to
Iowa.
Watch
this
short
news
clip
on
WOI-TV
about
their
story:
I
believe
that
more
families
would
open
their
homes
to
more
children,
like
the
Craigs,
if
international
adoption
was
a
smoother
and
more
predictable
process.
And
it's
my
hope
that
my
colleagues
in
the
US
House
and
Senate
support
this
important
legislation.
All
the
best,
Bruce
