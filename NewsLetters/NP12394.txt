Dear
Neighbor,
Its Friday morning. A citizen wakes up, writes
emails and makes a phone call.
The
person has a meeting soon, so he pulls up Google Maps to figure out a
route.
He then hops into a cab, checks
Facebook on his phone, texts his friend and plays Candy Crush on his
iPhone.
After the meeting he heads to
the office, logs on to his computer and G-chats with a friend about
where he plans to go for dinner that
evening.
Later that evening, after dinner, he uploads a photo from dinner
on Instagram. Throughout the day, the government was with him every
step of the way.
Until last year, most Americans were unaware that their
every move could be tracked by Big
Brother.
Through the NSA, the government has the ability to read
emails, texts, phone logs, track location and movements, snoop and
collect information about individuals through smart phone apps, read
g-chats and look at private photos.
The
failure to disclose any of this information until recently is why
Americans fear for their privacy. And they should. Big Government kept a big
secret.
How did we get here? Over the
years, technology has rapidly evolved and given power-hungry, unelected
bureaucrats the capability to sift through data and find out more
information than ever. But just because they
can,
doesnt mean they
should.
But the ease of access to this information was too
tempting for government. They snooped, and now we
know.
The White House claims that the NSA has no interest in
monitoring the activity of ordinary Americans. But, most Americans have
a hard time accepting that. They question the truth in that statement
for the simple fact that
had
Edward Snowden not revealed what was really going on within NSA in the
first place; this snooping and spying would still be going on in the
dark shadows of government operations.
And, equally important,
they know that this snooping and spying is still going on
today.
Furthermore, NSAs own internal watchdog
revealed dozens of instances where employees misused their intelligence
capabilities to spy on people, even ex-girlfriends. Why? Simply because
they can.
The secret truth we are learning is
that for years the NSA has quietly snooped and spied on millions of
people without a warrant or justification to do
so.
In my opinion, illegal activity has occurred.
NSA
argues that its employees only carry out the actions necessary to find
terrorists and protect our country. They have even claimed that
terrorist attacks have been prevented as a result of their
actions.
If this is true, those success stories should
be made public. At a Judiciary Committee hearing last week, I asked
Deputy Attorney General James Cole how many criminal cases have been
filed as a result of this massive spying
operation.
His answer?
Maybe
one.
And he wasnt even
100% sure of that.

questioning]
Thats right, the NSA has launched one of
the largest data collection programs in U.S. history that monitors
who we call, how long we talk to them, who they called, and where our
calls were made from, all in order to maybe catch one bad
guy.
In any event, the ends do not justify the
means. NSA has trampled on the Fourth Amendment rights of millions of
Americans.
The Patriot Act permits
targeted surveillance when that surveillance is justified by a courtit
does not permit the intrusive activities brought to light by
Snowden.
This old Soviet-style, dragnet approach -- casting a wide net in hopes
of catching a big fish -- is not permitted under the law.
It is also unconstitutional. It is
similar to police searching homes in in an entire zip code looking for
one outlaw.
No judge would
permit this but that is the type of action the NSA does through massive
metadata collection. Government spies simply cannot disregard the law
just because it is inconvenient.
The Fourth
Amendment gives every American the right to be secure in their homes,
papers and effects without fear of government intrusion.
The NSAs actions have been in clear
violation of the spirit and letter of the Constitution.
Before I came
to Congress, I was a criminal court judge for over 20 years. On the
bench, I signed thousands of warrants, but not once did I sign a
warrant to search homes in an entire zip code in hopes of finding one outlaw
who may live there. The same rules apply to
technology.
Now that some of the activities of NSA have been made
public, Congress needs to reign in the out of control agency. The
Executive Branch has acted outside of the law, and so the Legislative Branch
must act to restore the rule of law and regain the public
trust.
