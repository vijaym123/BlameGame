One of the core functions of the federal government is interstate commerce, and a vibrant transportation system directly impacts Americas ability to compete in the global economy. This week the House voted on the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 which extends federal surface transportation programs through May 2015. This bill is paid for and addresses the immediate need to ensure the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and provide fiscal certainty to the states. While this bill leaves a lot to be desired, all of us can see that our infrastructure is crumbling around us. Im actively working with my colleagues on long-term solutions to make our transportation system safer and more efficient, thereby strengthening our economy and spurring job creation.
Finding a long-term funding solution to strengthen our transportation network remains a top priority of Congress. However, this legislation is the responsible solution at this time, ensuring that we dont play politics with these programs and enabling us to continue making improvements to our surface transportation system. The bill now moves to the Senate for approval.
I also took the opportunity to speak on the House floor about the continuing terrorist attacks that Israel is experiencing from Hamas. Israel has made several attempts to diffuse the difficult situation. Hamas has responded by saying: We will not agree to quiet in exchange for quiet. If Israel does not agree to our demands, I expect we will continue this battle. Can you imagine that? Demands from Hamas that Israel not respond, not respond to hundreds of rocket attacks. Thats the only way you will get quiet for quiet between Israel and Hamas.

Last week I attended a briefing with Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer to discuss the ongoing situation in Gaza. One thing I found interesting is all the Israeli representatives had on their phones an application which sounded an air raid siren every time it sounded in Israel. We scarcely got through the briefing because they were continually going off all around the room, and I imagine myself in my hometown hunkered down in my basement against a rocket attack. No civilization should live this way.
Israel is one of Americas strongest allies and should have every right to defend its citizens from continued terrorist attacks. During World War II, the question was asked if more could have been done to protect Jewish people from an attempted extinction. Now people are questioning why Israel is defending itself so vigorously from a potential extinction. No nation in the world would allow hundreds of rockets to rain down on them without a response and neither should Israel.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
