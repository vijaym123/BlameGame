We are completely out of ideas.
After President Clinton emailed you this morning to ask for help, we really thought we would be in a better place.
But we aren't. The Koch Brothers, Karl Rove, and the other Republican outside groups are spending millions against us. It's the biggest spending spree of any midterm election EVER. So big -- it doesn't even look like President Clinton's email can dig us out of this hole.
There is still time, though. Things are rough, but we&rsquo;re not ready to accept defeat. If we can bring in 5O,OOO donations before tomorrow&rsquo;s ad buy deadline, we can get back on track. Will you answer President Clinton&rsquo;s call-to-action today?
