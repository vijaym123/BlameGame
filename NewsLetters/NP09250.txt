House Veterans
Affairs Committee Hearing on Alleged Secret Wait
Lists
5/28/14
This evening at 5:30pm MT/7:30pm ET, Congressman Doug
Lamborn, the second ranking Republican on the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, will be taking part in a hearing examining the VAs failure
to comply with subpoenas issued and designed to discover information
on the VAs destruction of documents that may be associated with the
secret wait lists cited by Phoenix VA Health Care System
whistleblowers.
Three VA officials were
previously invited to discuss this issue before the committee May 22, but
refused to show up. VA has promised to make officials available to the
committee May 28, but in the event they do not appear, VA will be
served with a subpoena that would compel all three witnesses to testify
before the committee May 30.
