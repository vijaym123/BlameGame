Obamacare has only been out for one month, and already I'm hearing an
overwhelming number of stories of how Obamacare is negatively affecting
folks across West Tennessee. I am eager to hear your story of how
Obamacare is impacting you and your family.
Share the details of your story HERE
(from lost coverage, to sky-rocketing premiums
and increases in deductibles) and I will share it with my colleagues in
Washington so that they may understand how this disastrous law is
affecting real people in our community.
*Don't forget to keep up-to-date on Facebook
and Twitter
. Have a great weekend!
