Neighbor,
If you can pull yourself away from rewatching highlights of the Super
Bowl, there are two photos I want to share with you:
HOUSING CONFERENCE
Last month I welcomed United States Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Shaun Donovan to Tacoma. He keynoted a conference I convened
about the future of the housing market in the South Sound. More than
300 people involved in real estate, affordable housing, and
construction were in attendance.
As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, housing policy
is one of the issues I spend a lot of time working on. It's extremely
important to the overall health of our local economy. You can see
photos and video from the conference here, and you can read more about
my views on housing policy.
While Secretary Donovan was in town, I couldn't pass up the opportunity
to give him his own 12th Man jersey. The Secretary is 12th in line to
the Presidency, so I think it fits him especially well.
Congressman Heck welcomes new Seahawks fan and United States Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan to Tacoma to discuss
federal housing policy.
STATE OF THE UNION
In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama spoke
about the need to give more Americans the opportunity to find
good-paying jobs. He outlined a number of specific policies including
improving technology in our schools, offering more high school
technical education, raising the minimum wage, and renewing emergency
unemployment insurance for jobseeking Americans.
Economists are increasingly worried the economic recovery is leaving
behind the middle class and those working to get into it. I'm worried
about that, too. Every family in Washington state deserves the
opportunity to thrive. Members of Congress must do a better job working
with their colleagues from both parties towards that goal.
There's one last thought on the State of the Union I want to share.
Every Member of Congress is allowed to invite guests to the State of
the Union. My guests this year were three of my favorite people: Sgt.
Luke Cifka, his wife Kait, and his son Wyatt.
Congressman Heck invited the Cifka family to attend President Obama's
State of the Union address.
Sgt. Cifka is an Olympia High School graduate (in fact, he graduated
two years after my son, Bob) who was on patrol in Afghanistan when he
was injured this past May. He's currently living at Walter Reed
National Military Medical Center in Maryland as he prepares for the
next phase of his life. I'm honored all three were able to come down to
D.C. for the speech.
To the Cifkas and all military families who serve our country: you have
the thanks of a very grateful nation.
Sincerely,
Denny Heck, Member of Congress

Neighbor,
If
you
can
pull
yourself
away
from
rewatching
highlights
of the
Super
Bowl,
there
are
two
photos
I
want
to
share
with
you:
HOUSING
CONFERENCE
Last
month
I
welcomed
United
States
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Secretary
Shaun
Donovan
to
Tacoma.
He
keynoted
a
conference
I
convened
about
the
future
of the
housing
market
in
the
South
Sound.
More
than
300
people
involved
in
real
estate,
affordable
housing,
and
construction
were
in
attendance.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Financial
Services
Committee,
housing
policy
is
one
of
the
issues
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
working
on.
It's
extremely
important
to
the
overall
health
of
our
local
economy.
You
can
see
photos
and
video
from
the
conference
here,
and
you
can
read
more
about
my
views
on
housing
policy.
While
Secretary
Donovan
was
in
town,
I couldn't
pass
up
the
opportunity
to
give him
his
own
12th
Man
jersey.
The
Secretary
is
12th
in
line
to
the

so
I
think
it
fits
him
especially
well.

is

the
middle

and

I'm
worried
about that,
too.
Every
family
in
Washington
state deserves
the opportunity
to
thrive.
Members
of
Congress must
do
a
better
job
working with
their
colleagues
from
both
parties towards
that
goal.
There's
one
last thought
on
the
State
of
the
Union
I
want
to
share.
Every
Member
of
Congress
is
allowed
to
invite
guests
to
the
State
of
the
Union.
My
guests
this
year
were
three
of
my
favorite
people:
Sgt.
Luke
Cifka,
his
wife
Kait,
and
his
son
Wyatt.
Congressman
Heck
invited
the
Cifka
family
to
attend
President
Obama's
State
of
the
Union
address.
Sgt.
Cifka
is
an
Olympia
High
School
graduate
(in
fact,
he
graduated
two
years
after
my
son,
Bob)
who was
on
patrol
in
Afghanistan
when
he
was
injured
this
past
May.
He's
currently
living
at
Walter
Reed
National
Military
Medical
Center
in
Maryland
as
he
prepares
for
the
next
phase
of
his
life.
I'm
honored
all
three
were
able
to
come
down
to
D.C.
for
the
speech.
To
the
Cifkas
and
all
military
families
who
serve
our
country:
you
have
the
thanks
of
a
very
grateful
nation.
