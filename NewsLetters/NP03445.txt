Dear Friends,
This week, Members of Congress were
sworn into office after the American people overwhelmingly demanded last
November that Congress cut through the red tape and address a growing
list of national and international issues.
As one of those
Members, I will work tirelessly to build a better South Florida and a
better nation through common sense bills that promote job creation,
strengthen our economy, and support freedom and democracy around the
world.
This includes passing legislation to approve
the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This legislation will
allow our nation to become less dependent on oil coming from unreliable,
hostile, or undemocratic countries. In this new Congress, I will also
remain committed to serving our veterans by advancing legislation that
allows us to better care for the needs of those who have sacrificed so
much in the service of our nation. In 2015, I will also
collaborate with my colleagues to strengthen the American economy and
addresses our national deficit.
Although some progress has been made
recently in decreasing the deficit, it continues to pose a threat to our
economic health.
Locally, I will strive to make Miami a hub for
innovation and economic activity by supporting South Floridas
entrepreneurs and industries and capitalizing on our citys position as the
tourism, trade, and travel epicenter of the
Americas.
Our nation must once again take a position of leadership in
international affairs.
Recently, the president gave the Castro
dictatorship a host of concessions which in my opinion will only serve as an
economic lifeline for the Castro brothers and undermines those fighting
for human rights and democracy in Cuba.
I believe that these
policy changes do not help the Cuban people; instead they will further
embolden their oppressors and threaten our national security
interests.
In 2015, I will continue my advocacy for those who have sacrificed
so much to achieve a free and democratic Cuba.
Both
at home and abroad, Americans need solutions that improve our nation
and ensure its success while providing a bright future for our children
and grandchildren. From achieving energy independence, to lowering
our deficit, and to continuing fighting for human rights and democracy
in Cuba and around the globe, I will continue to work tirelessly to
build a better South Florida and a better nation.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
