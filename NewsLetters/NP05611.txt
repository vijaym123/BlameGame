Supporting Charter
Schools
Yesterday, I visited the Louisiana
Key Academy, which is a charter school for dyslexic students.
I've always supported charter schools like the Key Academy and the Max
Charter School for dyslexic students because they give parents the
power to choose a school that is the best fit for their child.
Tragically, the Louisiana Association of Educators
filed a lawsuit
to defund charter schools
This lawsuit
does not have students best interests at heart.
We must all
work together to encourage our childrens
success.
Restraining the EPA
I joined
Rep. John Fleming
to urge Senator Mary Landrieu and the Senate Energy Committee to push
back on the EPAs attempt to lower the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards for ozone.
If lowered, these standards will destroy
Louisiana energy and manufacturing jobs.
At a minimum, Senator
Landrieu and her committee should join us in opposing the Presidents
ozone regulations, before Louisiana jobs are put in
jeopardy.
Strengthening
America
Finally, I recently joined Laura
Ingraham on her national radio show to talk about important issues
facing Louisiana.
You can listen to our interview by clicking

I will continue to work for
positive change in Washington.
