Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Forty-two years ago,
Congress passed a law mandating public schools provide comparable
educational and athletics programs to both boys and girls. When my wife and I
were growing up, I could play football, baseball, and participate in
many other school activities that my wife could not. Today, because of
Title IX, women represent over 40% of all college and high school
athletes. Title IX doesnt just expand equal access in athletics, this law
has increased gender equity in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) education.
I remain committed to
building on the successes of Title IX and I will continue to fight for
fairness and equality for women in Nevada and across the United
States.
For more information and to learn more about my work in the
Senate on behalf of Nevadans or to contact me, please visit
