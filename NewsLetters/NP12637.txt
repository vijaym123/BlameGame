State of the
Union

State of the
Union
speech on bypassing Congress by using executive orders in
possibly unconstitutional ways.
An executive order can be properly
used to carry out Congressionally-authorized actions, however using
orders to legislate and bypass Congress is a violation of the
Constitutional separation of powers.
