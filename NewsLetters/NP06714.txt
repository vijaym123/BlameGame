How can we help?
Navigating the vast and complex bureaucracy of a federal agency can be overwhelming and frustrating. One of the most important roles I have as Representative in Congress is to help constituents with issues involving federal agencies.
Our office cannot dictate a particular outcome or override a decision made by a federal agency, but we can inquire on your behalf to get answers to questions and find solutions.
For example, if a company has scheduled an employee to fly overseas for a business trip and his or her passport has expired, we can help you apply for expedited renewal. Some additional examples include:
Track the status of Social Security disability claims
Provide information on Medicare eligibility for a claim or assist with the appeals process
Work with Veterans Affairs on medical or benefit claims
Help find lost military records
Assist with active duty-military benefits claims
Check with the IRS on status of delayed tax refund or applications for tax-exempt status
These are a few examples of how we can help. Please contact our office in Greenville at 864-241-1075 or Spartanburg at 864-583-3264.
You will need to fill out an Authorization Form to allow our office to inquire on your behalf. You can find the form, and
more information
on our website.
If you are not a resident of the Fourth District but need assistance with a federal agency, you should contact your Representative or Senator in Congress. Find your House member
