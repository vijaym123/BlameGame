Dear Friend,
This week there was much non-sense
in Washington about the "heathcare fix." The Affordable Care was
enacted to serve the best interests of the American people, and despite the
problems, millions of American families are already experiencing the
benefits and protections from it. The GOP should stop pushing for the
failure of health reform and start working with Democrats to
strengthen this historical law.
Rangel Career Fair
2013:
It was a great day in New York this past Monday as hundreds
of people turned out to the
2013 Rangel Career
Fair
at the CCNY. Boosting and rebuilding America's economy starts with
creating jobs in the community. This Career Fair is my ongoing effort
to spur economic recovery in our District. The event offered many
job-seekers valuable networking experience, the chance to receive advice
and information from over 70 of the country's top employers, as well
as provided the opportunity for many to become gainfully employed. I am
grateful to CCNY's President Lisa S. Coico and her staff for helping
to create a pathway for hundreds of people seeking jobs to achieve the
American Dream. If you weren't able to attend this year, I hope you
would join us in 2014.
Affordable Care
Act:
This week, the President announced his plan to make
administrative adjustments that will allow consumers to receive more information
and choices regarding health care plans, including the option to keep
their old plans. As a result, insurers can offer consumers the option
to renew their 2013 health plans in 2014, without change. While
the GOP continues their attacks and failed efforts to repeal or
undermine the law, the President is doing what he can to ensure that we do not
return to the old individual market that continually subjected
Americans to financial ruin and denied coverage. Under the Affordable Care
Act, insurance companies are required to notify individuals of options
available in the health insurance marketplace, premium and cost
assistance available in the marketplace, and consumer protections not
provided under existing plans.
Super Typhoon
Haiyan:
The Philippines are reeling from the devastation of the
typhoon which struck the islands last week. The early numbers estimate as
many as 9.7 million people have been affected by the storm, and gusts
of wind reaching up to 235mph. Thousands have tragically lost their
lives in the wake of this disaster, and the people of the Philippines
desperately need help to care for the sick and injured. If you want to
find out more about how you can help, please visit the
USAID Website for Typhoon Haiyan , or the
State Department
for information.Let us keep all those
suffering in the Philippines in our thoughts and prayers.
