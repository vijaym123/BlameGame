I was honored to participate in the Manufacturing Day event that Wilo
USA LLC hosted this past Friday in Thomasville.
Manufacturing Day was
celebrated nationwide with nearly 1,500 events to showcase the
important role played by manufacturing both in local communities and
the nation and to highlight careers available in this industry.
Manufacturing is not only a major economic driver in the Eighth
District, but it is also a pillar of our nation's economy and essential
to job creation.
I applaud Wilo for hosting this event and thank them
for their investment in our community.
Can you join me for coffee?:
If you were unable to join me for coffee during the August District
Work Period, I would love to see you this Tuesday at Sidetrack Caf in
Eastman.
Drop-in any time between 9:30am - 10:30am to discuss the
major issues facing our nation and to ask any questions you may have.
Members of my staff will also be available, should you need assistance
with federal benefits.
Coffee with your Congressman
Tuesday October 7, 2014
Sidetrack Caf
312 Main Street, Eastman GA
9:30am - 10:30am
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
