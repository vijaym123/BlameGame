Dear Friend,
I don&rsquo;t mean to be an alarmist, but I&rsquo;m definitely sounding an alarm. We have a plan to win this election, but we can&rsquo;t implement that plan if we miss our fundraising goals. Right now, we&rsquo;re coming up short, and we need $3,627 to hit our $50,000 goal by midnight TONIGHT. Can you chip in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
&ldquo;Coming up short&rdquo; is one of those things you really don&rsquo;t want to hear on a campaign -- not in September, not in October, and definitely not in November. If we come up short for Ed, we have no one to blame but ourselves. We need to give Ed the resources he needs to win in November. And right now, we&rsquo;re a little short. Pitch in $5, $10, or more and help us hit $50,000 by midnight tonight.
Thanks,
Colleen
