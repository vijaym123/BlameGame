Dear Friend,
Just wanted to remind you about two things happening tomorrow.
1. It&rsquo;s Primary Day in Massachusetts! After tomorrow, the general election kicks off, and we&rsquo;re in the final stretch of this race.
2. Tomorrow is also the deadline for our $50,000 primary fundraising goal. Time is short, and right now, we still have about $6,025 to go. Can you chip in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Thanks, and happy Primary Day.
Ed
