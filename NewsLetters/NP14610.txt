The Farmer's Thesis
Dear Friends,
Years ago, when I was in college, I had a desperate need for some money. Like most students, I was strapped for money when it came to many things, but I remember the most important at that moment. Attending the Temptations concert at the Palladium Ballroom in Houston. So several of my friends and I decided to bail hay on a farm just north of the city to make some quick cash. I chuckle now when I realize some of my city slicker colleagues inside the Beltway think baling hay refers to getting some guy named 'Hay' out of jail. But back in my day, we knew all about baling hay - with our hands. Let me tell you, it was hard, itchy, and back straining work.
The farmer who hired us had a horse driven wagon, and that is where we loaded the hay. The boss noticed that anytime I got into the wagon, I got in from the rear, even to ride up front.
He asked me why I was doing that? I explained that I didn&rsquo;t want to get too close to the back kicking legs of the horse. The farmer laughed and said, &ldquo;The last thing this horse wants to do is kick while it is pulling the wagon. Haven&rsquo;t you heard that a horse can&rsquo;t kick when it&rsquo;s plowing and can&rsquo;t plow when it&rsquo;s kicking?&rdquo; And while I never quite accepted the farmer&rsquo;s thesis, I did remember it and modified it. You can&rsquo;t work and kick at the same time.
It got me thinking. What if the House of Representatives chose some tough but critical piece of legislation, and then decided to work on it feverishly to pull it through the legislative process? And what if we did so with only one rule, no kicking!
