Dear Friends,
A few weeks ago, I attended the
Hyundai Hope On Wheels National Launch Event in New York City to
celebrate the fight against pediatric cancer, as I'm glad to do every year. During this year's event I was
especially honored to be presented with Hyundai's "Ambassador of Hope" Award.
This is a battle which must be fought and won, no matter what. I greatly look forward to the
day when no parent ever again has to hear the words, "Your child has
cancer." There is no doubt that of all of America's assets, our children
are surely our best hope for the future.
For these reasons, I was ecstatic to learn that by the end of 2014, Hyundai Hope On Wheels will
have awarded more than $86 million towards childhood cancer research in
pursuit of a cure!
I invite you to read more about Hyundai Hope on Wheels and get involved at
http://www.hyundaihopeonwheels.org/ .
In other news,
I was happy to be featured in a brand new
video highlighting how my House colleagues and I were able to spend the
recent District Work Week catching up with our constituents. You can check it out
here .
Whether in Western Pennsylvania or Washington, I will never stop working
to create jobs, grow our economy, and expand opportunities for all in
order to restore an America that works.
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Commends
Speaker's Announcement
of Select Committee on Benghazi
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Friday, May 2nd, regarding Speaker John Boehner's announcement of his intent to establish a select committee in the House of Representatives to investigate the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack against a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
"I strongly applaud Speaker Boehner's decision to form a select committee to finally cut through the frustrating fog of the Benghazi terrorist attack against our citizens. It was tragic enough that four innocent Americans were killed in an orchestrated, al Qaeda-related assault on the 11 th
anniversary of 9/11. When the true story behind that attack was deliberately twisted by political actors in the executive branch, tragedy turned to scandal.
"Recent news now tells us that the Obama administration actively planned to conceal facts from the American people. This shameful obstruction of the truth must not stand. It is a dishonor to our country and an insult to those who needlessly died. The facts behind what occurred that night in Benghazi - however painful or infuriating or embarrassing they may be - must be fully exposed. Truth must no longer be another casualty of this extremely shameful episode."

Congress can be viewed

Rep. Kelly Praises House Action
to Enforce VA Accountability
House-passed MILCON/VA appropriations bill includes
two provisions inserted & co-sponsored by Rep. Kelly
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on the evening of Wednesday, April 30th, praising the passage by the House of Representatives of
H.R. 4486 , the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015, by a bipartisan vote of 416-1. The bill included report
language successfully inserted by Rep. Kelly
requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide a full status report by July 1, 2014, on actions taken by the VA to remedy the severe problems surrounding the leasing process for the Butler, PA Health Care Center as detailed in
a recent report by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (OIG) . Also included in the bill was an amendment co-sponsored by Rep. Kelly to ban performance bonuses for VA Senior Executive Service employees.
"I am extremely pleased that the House passed this critical legislation to provide proper support for our troops and our veterans as well as their families and our nation's defense infrastructure. In particular, I am very grateful that tonight's bill contains important provisions to enforce much-needed accountability at the VA at a time when a ' widespread and systemic lack of accountability ' has resulted in severe negligence toward veteran care. The long and necessary fight for reform at the VA is not over and must be waged until responsibility is restored and all of our veterans are efficiently receiving the full services they earned and deserve."
Kelly language included in H.R. 4486:
" Response to VA Inspector General report . - The Committee was disturbed by the March 31, 2014 Inspector General report describing the problems and lapses in management in the VA leasing process for the Butler, PA health care center.
While the Committee understands that changes have been made to operations in the VA Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction in response to the IG report, the Committee directs the VA to provide a report by July 1, 2014 documenting the structural, staffing, and process changes that have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented to prevent the problems with the Butler lease from happening anywhere else in the VA system."
