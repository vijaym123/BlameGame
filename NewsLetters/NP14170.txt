A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
November 17, 2013
Dear friends,
The predictably disastrous rollout of Obamacare, and the President's
unilateral decision to ignore parts of his law, show us what happens
when government tries to play too big a role in our lives. However,
this week we also saw examples of the positive impact it can have when
the proper legislative avenues are utilized. Keep reading for a wrap-up
of the week that was.
#KeepYourPlanAct: The President broke his promise to the American
people, but this week the House acted to give a voice to the millions
of Americans receiving cancellation notices, including many here in
Wisconsin. I was proud to co-sponsor the "Keep Your Plan" Act and went
on Fox & Friends to discuss how this bill may help many of my
constituents. I hope the President will consider it. Click on the link
to watch the interview:
Access to Capital + Small Businesses = Jobs! "Small companies that go
public increase employment by 156% on average. This is how the Googles
and the Apples, the Twitters and the Facebooks of the world started.
This week I introduced H.R. 3448, "Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act".
This bill supports America's newest jobs creators by creating a pilot
project to maximize their trading liquidity.
My hope is that this bill
will give these emerging growth companies greater access to much needed
capital so they can expand their businesses and create much needed
American jobs. I was very glad to see it receive unanimous support in
the Financial Services Committee and hope it will receive the same
level of support when it comes before the full House of
Representatives. For more information on this bill,

.
Listening to our job creators: This week I held the first meeting of my
manufacturers advisory council. It was great to hear from some of our
area's top manufacturers about the issues facing that industry today.
Manufacturers provide high-tech, high-paying jobs with good job
stability. As the largest industry sector in Wisconsin, accounting for
19% of the Wisconsin Gross State Product, it is important for me to
hear directly from manufacturers about the issues they face,
specifically over-burdensome regulations, so that I can work with them
on legislative options that will enable them to continue to grow their
businesses and create jobs.
Want to be a job holder? The past few years have been tough for
families in Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District.
Whether you worked
for the same company for 10, 15 or even 20 years and now find yourself
exploring a brand new career path, a recent college graduate trying to
figure out how to put your new degree to good use, or perhaps a Veteran
returning home after serving our country, we want to help you in your
search. Check out the panel on the right for details about our upcoming
job fair!
When the proper legislative avenues are utilized government can enable
Americans to live their lives in a manner that works best for them.
That is where I am going to continue to focus my efforts as your
Representative in Congress and, as always, I sincerely appreciate the
opportunity to do that on your behalf.
Have a great week,
Sean

Dear
friends,
The
predictably
disastrous

Obamacare,
and
the
President&#8217;s
unilateral

show
us

big
a

in
our
lives.
However,
this
week
we
also
saw
examples
of
the
positive
impact
it
can
have
when
the
proper
legislative
avenues
are
utilized.
Keep

for
a

that
was.
#KeepYourPlanAct:

the

to
give

including
many
here
in
Wisconsin.
I
was
proud
to
co-sponsor
the
&#8220;Keep
Your

Act
and
went
on
Fox
&amp;
Friends
to
discuss
how
this
bill
may
help
many
of
my
constituents.
I
hope
the
P resident
will
consider
it.

to
see
it

it
will
receive
the

Want
to
be
a

The
past
few
years
have
been
tough
for
families
in
Wisconsin&#8217;s
7 th
Congressional
District.

I
