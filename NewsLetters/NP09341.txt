Wicker Applauds Final Passage
of
Water Resources Legislation
Approval of
House-Senate Agreement Coincides
With Positive
News at Port of
Gulfport
Earlier this month, Mississippi welcomed a new addition to the
Port of Gulfport.
McDermott International, which serves the
offshore oil and gas industry, announced it would bring its pipeline
finishing operations to the East Pier and consolidate its Gulf of Mexico
operations center to Gulfport.
The investment is expected to create
at least 100 jobs.
The news
is an encouraging sign for Mississippi's Gulf Coast as the Port of
Gulfport Restoration Program continues.
Although two years away
from completion, the program is working to revitalize commercial
activity after the devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina.
The arrival
of McDermott is the restoration project's first major job
announcement, and I am optimistic it is only the beginning of future economic
development.
Like state and local officials, I support the Port of
Gulfport as a valuable and dynamic resource for Mississippi and the
entire Gulf Coast region.
It should be utilized to its fullest
potential.
More good news for
the Port of Gulfport, Port of Pascagoula, and Mississippi's many other
ports in recent days is the long-awaited final passage of the Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA).
The bipartisan legislation
the first of its kind in seven years
is instrumental to upgrading
Mississippi's ports, waterways, and flood-control projects.
It
earned overwhelming support in both the Senate and House of
Representatives.
Cochran Provision Improves Port
Maintenance
Ports like the Port of Pascagoula and
the Port of Gulfport stand to benefit from WRDA's reforms to the
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which was established for port improvements.
Specifically, the bill would increase the amount of funding
available for maintenance dredging, which many ports across the nation
desperately need.
I am pleased that
Sen. Thad Cochran was successful in equipping our ports with even
more opportunities to secure maintenance upgrades.
His amendment to
WRDA would expand crediting authority for navigation projects,
allowing more flexibility for ports like the Port of Gulfport to deepen
their channels.
Without timely dredging, ports risk missing out on
critical trade and economic
growth.
Infrastructure for
Storm Protection, Flood
Control
WRDA also recognizes the importance of ensuring that the
Gulf Coast continues to recover from the devastation wrought by
Hurricane Katrina.
The legislation authorizes funding for the
Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program to finish storm protection and
restoration projects.
Coincidentally, WRDAs final vote in Congress
nearly coincides with this year's National Hurricane Preparedness Week,
which runs May 25-31.
As
Mississippians know, adequate infrastructure is crucial to minimizing
the risk of damage when disaster strikes.
We are certainly
thankful for the flood-control mechanisms that were in place during the
historic floods along the Mississippi River in 2011.
WRDA would
help ensure these projects are properly updated and capable of protecting
lives and property.
As a
member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am proud to
have worked on WRDA during its consideration in the Senate.
The
capabilities of our water resources are integral to the health of our
economy and the future competitiveness of America's businesses.
When transportation channels are disrupted, jobs are threatened and
consumers are often burdened with higher prices.
WRDA represents a
bipartisan commitment to navigable and reliable water resources that
will sustain U.S. commerce and growth for years to come.
