BY THE NUMBERS: THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS WORKING
As we approach the fifth anniversary of Congress passing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), here's a look at how the health security law has changed the lives of millions of Americans:
16.4 million uninsured Americans
have gained coverage since the ACA was enacted in 2010
From 2013 to 2014, the percentage of Californians without health coverage dropped from
21.6 to 15.3 percent
Californians received
an average of $5,200 per household
through Covered California to help them purchase affordable health insurance in 2014
2.3 million young adults
have gained coverage since 2010 due to the ACA provision allowing young adults to remain on a parents plan until age 26
9.4 million people with Medicare
have saved over $15 billion on prescription drugs since the laws enactment, for an average savings of
$1,598 per person
Nationwide, since the beginning of open enrollment in October 2013 to March 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from
20.3 percent to 13.2 percent
