Fishing Season's Coming - Asian Carp Out of Luck
Congressman Nolan explains his several amendments to combat invasive
species within the Water Resources Reform & Development Act (WRRDA).
Dear Friend,
By the time Governor Dayton opens our 2014 Minnesota fishing season on
May 8th, near my hometown of Brainerd, the President will hopefully
have signed the Water Resources Reform & Development Act (WRRDA) into
law. This legislation includes my amendment to protect Minnesota's
favorite sport - fishing - and our multibillion-dollar sport fishing
industry by closing the St. Anthony Lock & Dam in Minneapolis to
prevent Asian carp from invading our lakes, rivers, and watersheds. The
bill also contains another Nolan amendment expanding the definition of
"invasive species" to include animal as well as plant life, so federal
money can be used for both research and abatement.
As a member of the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee that
crafted the bill - and as a conferee helping work out differences
between the House and Senate versions - I am particularly proud of that
amendment, as well as my provision to protect the Harbor Trust Funds
from raids for other purposes.
We need 100% of those trust funds to address a ten-year Great Lakes
dredging backlog that has slowed shipping commerce to just 80% of
capacity - costing thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in
business activity throughout the system.
With that in mind, I hope you will take a few minutes to watch this
interview, scheduled to air throughout northern Minnesota on CNN later
this month. Along with Asian carp, Great Lakes commerce, and other
important provisions of the WRRDA bill, we talk about my return to
Congress and other topics I think you'll find interesting.
As my dad used to say, every day you spend fishing adds a day to your
life. Time to get our gear ready. Have a great week.
Sincerely,

Medicare "Doc Fix" Passes House
Members of Congress came together last week to pass a bipartisan -
albeit short-term - compromise to prevent skyrocketing prices in what
our seniors pay for Medicare by ensuring doctors treating those
patients are fully compensated for their services. The bill also
improves community mental health programs, as well as reauthorizes the
Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program,
which provides much-needed health and development services for children
in low-income families. What we truly need, however, is a long-term
solution, and I'm hopeful the Congress will be able to find one over
the next year. In the meantime, I'll continue to look for ways to find
a permanent, common-sense solution to this recurring issue.

Honeybees' Demise Threatens World Food Supplies
Greeting Representative John Conyers, Jr., at a recent event hosted by
the Center for Food Safety to address our urgent need to save our
honeybee population from collapse.
As I told a roomful of members of the Center for Food Safety
organization last week, our bee colonies are collapsing, and I intend
to use my position on the House Agriculture Committee to do something
about it. Honeybees play a critical role in nature - pollination -
underpinning our entire food chain, as well as our global ability to
feed billions of people. These creatures are disappearing at an
alarming rate; we need to find out why, and then we need to fix it.
Total collapse would mean the end of our agricultural and food systems
as we know them - and as the richest and most technologically-advanced
country in the world, we should be devoting as many resources as we
possibly can - right now - to prevent this disaster. Among other
efforts, I'm cosponsoring legislation - H.R.2692, the Saving America's
Pollinators Act - to make sure the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) conducts comprehensive research into certain pesticides to ensure
these "neonicotinoid" chemicals aren't responsible for killing bees
around the world. Read more from an article in POLITICO here

Essar Project: Grave Concerns, Great Potential
Congressman Nolan with Madhu Vuppuluri, CEO of Essar Steel Minnesota,
in Washington last week. Essar Steel's currently stalled taconite and
steel manufacturing project in Nashwauk has the potential to bring
thousands of jobs to Minnesota's Eighth District.
The Essar Steel taconite operation would bring 2500 jobs to northern
Minnesota by investing more than $3 billion in both iron ore processing
and in steel manufacturing on the Iron Range. Once completed, the
company estimates they will process 700 million tons of iron ore each
year. Ultimately the goal is to be the first steel manufacturing plant
in northern Minnesota. Unfortunately, the project is fraught with
cash-flow problems, and despite breaking ground in 2008, construction
has stalled. Last week, I met Essar Steel's President & CEO, Madhu
Vuppuluri, as well as the U.S. Ambassador to India, Dr. S. Jaishankar,
because I have grave concerns regarding the outstanding debt this
multi-billion-dollar firm has to local Minnesotan construction
companies and their employees. This project is hugely important to the
future of mining in Minnesota, and I'm fully committed to ensuring it
moves forward in a way that serves workers, local businesses, and
advances our economy.

Emergency Unemployment Assistance Progresses in the Senate
Unemployment assistance helps real people in transition who are out of
work through no fault of their own, and last week, the Senate took a
critical, bipartisan step toward extending emergency unemployment
assistance to the millions of Americans who have been without this
crucial lifeline since December. The chamber voted 65-34 to begin
debate on the issue, and is expected to pass a measure today. As I
recently told the Star Tribune
, if the House Majority were to
allow us to hold a vote on extending these benefits to two million
Americans - including some 200,000 veterans - I'm confident it would
pass. My fellow Democrats in the House and I have signed a petition to
force the vote. We in the Congress have an obligation to come to the
aid of unemployed Americans during this tough economy, and I will
continue to push for a vote on behalf of those men and women who need
help now.

Our Week in Pictures
I discussed ways to end the notorious Veterans Affairs (VA) claims
backlog with Minnesotan members of the American Legion, including Ray
DeZurik of Breezy Point and Shirley Frederick of Hackensack.
Congratulations to EMTs Adam Donahue and Brian Meyer of North Branch,
with me in my office last week, for receiving the American Ambulance
Association's "Star of Life Award" in recognition of their lifesaving
work as outstanding paramedics.
I spoke to members of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers
Association - which represents more than 9,000 law enforcement
officers. Their work combatting crime and drug trafficking throughout
Minnesota deserves our full-fledged support in Congress.
I welcomed Erin Carlin and Mark Sakry of Boys and Girls Clubs of
Central Minnesota to my office, where we discussed the most pressing
issues for today's youth, as well as the work they're doing in teaching
young people the skills they need to succeed.
Members of the Arrowhead Regional Development Commission (ARDC) met
with me in my office to discuss what they're doing to help out-of-work
Minnesotans find good-paying, sustainable jobs now and in the future.
I addressed a crowd of Deer River students (and one student from
Virginia), all participants in their school's CloseUp program, on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol.
Ely High School students made their annual trip to D.C. last weekend,
and I was more than honored to be their part-time host. Here we are on
the U.S. Capitol steps - you can read about their trip in the Ely Echo.
_____
Briefly...
Last week, I:
.
Cosponsored the REPAY Supplies Act (H.R.3318) to make
permanent the tax deduction we offer to teachers who pay for school
supplies out of their own pockets.
.
Joined Republicans and Democrats in strongly urging
Republican leadership to move forward with the Voting Rights Amendment
Act, a bipartisan bill that would restore the safeguards of the 1965
law, many of which were done away with by a Supreme Court decision last
year.
.
Urged the House Appropriations Committee to fully fund both
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Harbor Maintenance Trust
Fund in next year's budget.

Finally...
Rah for the U of M!
Fellow University of Minnesota alumni gathered last week on Capitol
Hill to celebrate our alma mater's continued success in education and
innovation.
The University of Minnesota is responsible for the creation of one of
my favorite fruits: the delightful, delectable honeycrisp apple,
developed by U of M scientists in the 1990s, it quickly became one of
our nation's best-selling apples, helping to breathe new life into an
agricultural industry and brighten the desks of every teacher across
the country. It's just one of the many shining examples of the
innovation that flourishes at the University of Minnesota, as well as
the kind of societal reward we can expect when we support the education
of our young men and women.
I credit the brilliant professors and students at the University of
Minnesota - and their deep commitment to bettering our society and our
world - with helping inspire me to enter politics. As I told the crowd
last week, I pledge to keep working every avenue to improve access to
education grants, keep college tuition and student loan interest rates
low and affordable, and find every last dollar I can to support the
remarkable work of our great University of Minnesota.

Representative
Rick
Nolan
Fishing
Season's
Coming

Out
of

Congressman
Nolan
explains
his
several
amendments
to
combat
invasive
species within the
Water
Resources
Reform
&amp;
Development
Act
(WRRDA).
Dear
Friend,
By
the
time
Governor
Dayton
opens
our
2014
Minnesota
fishing
season
on
May
8th,
near
my
hometown
of
Brainerd,
the
President
will
hopefully
have
signed
the
Water
Resources
Reform
&amp;
Development
Act
(WRRDA) into
law.
This
legislation includes
my
amendment
to
protect Minnesota's
favorite
sport
-
fishing
-
and
our
multibillion-dollar
sport
fishing
industry
by
closing
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
&amp;
Dam
in
Minneapolis
to
prevent
Asian
carp
from
invading
our
lakes,
rivers,
and
watersheds.
The
bill also
contains
another
Nolan
amendment
expanding
the
definition
of
"invasive
species"
to include animal
as
well
as
plant
life,
so
federal
money
can
be
used
for
both
research
and
abatement.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Transportation
&amp;
Infrastructure
Committee
that
crafted
the
bill
&#8211;
and
as
a
conferee
helping
work
out
differences
between
the
House
and
Senate
versions
&#8211;
I
am
particularly
proud
of
that
amendment,
as
well
as
my
provision
to
protect
the
Harbor
Trust
Funds
from
raids
for
other
purposes.
We
need
100%
of
those
trust
funds
to
address
a
ten-year
Great
Lakes
dredging
backlog
that
has
slowed
shipping
commerce
to
just
80%
of
capacity
&#8211;
costing
thousands
of
jobs
and
billions
of
dollars
in
business
activity
throughout
the
system.
With
that
in
mind,
I
hope
you
will
take
a
few
minutes
to
watch
this
interview,
scheduled
to
air
throughout
northern
Minnesota
on
CNN
later
this
month .
Along
with
Asian
carp,
Great
Lakes
commerce,
and
other
important
provisions
of
the
WRRDA
bill,
we
talk
about
my
return
to
Congress
and
other
topics
I
think
you&#8217;ll
find
interesting.
As
my
dad
used
to
say,
every
day
you
spend
fishing
adds
a
day
to
your
life.
Time
to
get
our
gear
ready.
Have
a
great
week.
Sincerely,
Medicare

Honeybees'

Greeting
Representative
John

at
a
recent
event
hosted
by
the
Center
for
Food
Safety
to
address
our
urgent
need
to
save
our
honeybee
population
from
collapse.
As
I
told
a
roomful
of
members
of
the
Center

last

our
bee
colonies
are
collapsing,
and
I
intend
to
use
my position

to
do
something
about
it .
Honeybees
play

pollination

underpinning
our
entire
food

as
well
as
our
global
ability

These
creatures
are
disappearing
at
an
alarming
rate;
we
need
to
find
out
why,
and
then
we
need
to
fix
it.
Total
collapse
would
mean
the
end
of
our
agricultural
and
food
systems
as
we
know
them
-
and
as
the
richest
and
most

country
in
the

we
should
be
devoting
as
many
resources
as
we
possibly
can
-
right
now
- to
prevent
this
disaster.

I'm

Essar
Project:
Grave
Concerns,
Great
Potential
Congressman
Nolan
with
Madhu
Vuppuluri,
CEO
of
Essar
Steel
Minnesota,
in
Washington
last
week.
Essar
Steel's
currently
stalled
taconite
and
steel
manufacturing project
in Nashwauk
has
the
potential
to
bring
thousands
of
jobs
to
Minnesota's
Eighth
District.
The
Essar
Steel
taconite
operation would
bring
2500
jobs
to
northern
Minnesota
by
investing
more
than
$3
billion
in
both
iron
ore
processing
and
in
steel
manufacturing
on
the
Iron
Range.
Once
completed,
the
company
estimates
they
will
process
700
million
tons
of
iron ore
each
year.
Ultimately
the
goal
is
to
be
the
first
steel
manufacturing
plant
in
northern
Minnesota. Unfortunately,
the
project
is
fraught
with
cash-flow
problems,
and
despite
breaking
ground
in
2008,
construction
has
stalled.
Last
week,
I
met
Essar
Steel's
President
&amp;
CEO ,
Madhu
Vuppuluri,
as
well
as
the
U.S.
Ambassador
to
India ,
Dr.
S.
Jaishankar, because
I
have
grave
concerns regarding
the
outstanding
debt
this
multi-billion-dollar
firm
has
to
local
Minnesotan
construction
companies
and
their
employees .
This
project
is
hugely
important
to
the
future
of
mining
in
Minnesota,
and
I'm
fully
committed
to
ensuring it
moves
forward
in
a
way
that
serves
workers,
local
businesses, and
advances
our
economy.

We
in

in
recognition
of
their
lifesaving
work
as
outstanding

I
spoke
to
members
of
the
Minnesota
Police

Peace
Officers
Association
-
which
represents
more
than
9,000
law
enforcement
officers. Their
work
combatting
crime
and
drug

throughout
Minnesota deserves
our
full-fledged
support
in
Congress.
I
welcomed
Erin
Carlin and
Mark
Sakry
of
Boys
and
Girls
Clubs
of
Central
Minnesota
to
my
office,
where
we
discussed
the
most

for
today's
youth,
as
well
as
the
work
they're
doing
in
teaching
young
people
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed.
Members
of
the
Arrowhead Regional

met
with
me
in

to
discuss
what
they're
doing
to
help
out-of-work
Minnesotans
find
good-paying,
sustainable
jobs
now
and
in
the
future.
I
addressed
a

Virginia),
all
participants
in
their
school's
CloseUp
program,
on
the

of
the
U.S.
Capitol.
Ely
High
School
students
made
their
annual

last
weekend,
and
I
was
more
than
honored
to
be
their
part-time
host. Here
we
are
on
the
U.S.
Capitol
steps
-
you
can
read
about
their
trip
in
the
Ely

Briefly...
Last
week,
I:
&#8226;
Cosponsored
the
REPAY
Supplies
Act
(H.R.3318)
to
make
permanent
the
tax
deduction
we
offer
to
teachers
who
pay
for
school
supplies
out
of
their
own
pockets.
&#8226;
Joined
Republicans
and
Democrats
in
strongly
urging
Republican
leadership
to
move
forward with
the
Voting
Rights
Amendment
Act ,
a
bipartisan
bill
that
would
restore
the
safeguards
of
the
1965
law,
many
of
which
were
done
away
with
by
a
Supreme
Court
decision
last
year.
&#8226;
Urged the
House Appropriations
Committee to fully fund both
the
Great

Restoration
Initiative
and
the
Harbor
Maintenance
Trust
Fund
in
next
year's
budget.
Finally...
Rah

M!
Fellow
University
of
Minnesota
alumni
gathered
last
week
on
Capitol
Hill
to
celebrate our
alma
mater's
continued
success
in
education
and
innovation.
The
University
of
Minnesota
is
responsible
for
the
creation
of
one
of
my
favorite
fruits:
the
delightful,
delectable
honeycrisp
apple,
developed
by
U
of
M
scientists
in
the
1990s,
it
quickly
became
one
of
our
nation's
best-selling
apples,
helping
to
breathe
new
life
into
an
agricultural
industry
and
brighten
the
desks
of
every
teacher
across
the
country.
It's
just
one
of
the
many
shining
examples
of
the
innovation
that
flourishes
at
the
University
of
Minnesota ,
as
well
as
the
kind
of
societal
reward
we
can
expect
when
we
support
the
education
of
our
young
men
and
women .
I
credit
the
brilliant
professors
and
students
at
the
University
of
Minnesota
- and
their
deep
commitment
to
bettering
our
society
and
our
world
-
with
helping
inspire
me
to
enter
politics.
As
I
told
the
crowd
last
week,
I
pledge
to
keep
working
every
avenue
to
improve
access
to
education
grants ,
keep
college
tuition
and
student
loan
interest
rates
low
and
affordable ,
and
find
every
last
dollar
I
can
to
support
the
remarkable
work
of
our
great
University
of
Minnesota.
