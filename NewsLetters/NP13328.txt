Dear friends,
I was back in
Washington this week as Congress reconvened for the first time in
2014.
Its shaping up to be a big year, with many issues on our plate
from the economy to the debt ceiling, from Obamacare to immigration
reform.
The start of a new year also gives us
a chance to look back at 2013 and reflect on all that we
accomplished.
Im proud of the work my office did
and continues to do
for
the people of Idaho.
When I was first elected to Congress,
I knew that constituent casework
helping constituents deal with all
the federal agencies
would be an aspect of my job.
But I had
no idea it would be one of the most important aspects.
And one
of the most rewarding.
Im not a believer in Big
Government.
But when the government does something, it should do it
well.
Whenever you deal with a federal agency, you have a right to
expect fair treatment and good service.
And if you dont get that, I
have a duty to help.
I am eager to help you in any way that I
can.
In 2013, my office helped 2,267 Idahoans that
contacted me for assistance.
We also brought back over $4 million
in money that constituents were owed by federal agencies.
Since I
came to Congress in 2011, my office has managed to help over 11,000
Idahoans that have contacted me for assistance.
Weve also
brought back over $10 million in money that constituents were owed by
federal agencies.
If you ever have trouble with a federal agency
or need some other form of assistance
I am always here to
help.
Just go to
my website , fill out the form, and
well reply to you as soon as possible.
In
2013, my office was also able to answer 66,838 letters, guide 808
Idahoans on US Capitol Tours, hold 421 meetings with constituents, groups and
businesses, and host 6 town halls meetings.
On the
legislative front, last year I introduced 6 bills and cosponsored 96 others
on a wide range of issues.
The biggest issue, of course, was the
economy.
Four of my 6 bills were directly targeted toward
helping Idahos economy.
Those bills
if signed into law - would
reduce federal interference in the management of Idahos resources, expand
our resource production, and create jobs.
To see a full list of
the bills I introduced and cosponsored in 2013 to help bolster our
economy, please click

Also,
if you havent taken my 2014 Constituent survey yet, its not too
late.
All you have to do is click
here .
By taking this survey, you will help me better represent you in
Washington.
I value your opinions and I appreciate your
feedback.
Thank you again for the privilege of serving you in
Congress.
While 2013 year was a successful year when it comes to
constituent service, I believe 2014 will be an even better
year.
