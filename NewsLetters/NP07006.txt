Dear Friend, The Republicans are getting serious about this fall&rsquo;s campaign.
My opponent has joined forces with GOP candidates up and down the ticket, and they&rsquo;ve opened a command center on the outskirts of Boston.
At the opening of the office, my opponent said, "The door is open. We can beat Ed Markey." And you know what? If Democrats sit out this election, he might be right. We have one week until our pre-primary filing deadline, and we&rsquo;re aiming to raise $25,000 by then. Republicans are getting organized and running hard, and we need to respond -- make a $5 contribution and help us hit our goal.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
My opponent is coordinating with Republicans up and down the ballot, and with a recent Boston Globe poll showing tight statewide races, we should expect a strong Republican turnout in November. We can&rsquo;t take a single day for granted -- we need to organize from now until Election Day, and that starts with people like you. If we hit our $25,000 pre-primary goal, we can fight even harder in the general election. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can before our deadline.
Thank you for your help.
Ed
