Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Off He Goes...
I was privileged to attend the change of command ceremony Monday at
Scott Air Force Base, where I presented my Congressional Record entry
saluting his service to General William Fraser III, retiring commander,
U.S. Transportation Command. In an unprecedented transition involving
three four-star generals, Fraser was succeeded by General Paul Selva,
who turned over his Air Mobility Command, also based at Scott, to
General Darren McDew.
Subcommittee Seeks Answers From Nuclear Regulatory Commission
On Wednesday, I chaired a hearing of the House Energy and Power
Subcommittee, which reviewed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's budget
request and policy priorities. NRC Chairman Allison Macfarlane
testified alongside NRC Commissioners Kristine Svinicki, George
Apostolakis, William Magwood, and William Ostendorff.
Allison Macfarlane
Subcommittee members questioned the commissioners on a range of issues,
including the commission's increasing budget, pending regulations, and
efforts to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process. We also
inquired about the NRC's productivity and use of resources, as the
commission has requested a budget increase despite a decreased workload.
I asked how, with $400 million more dollars and 800 more people, the
NRC is struggling to review 40 percent fewer licensing actions.
Comparing today's NRC with the NRC of ten years ago shows how
management efficiency has degraded over the last decade. In 2004, the
NRC expected the number of productive hours from the employees to be
1,776 per year. For Fiscal Year 2014, that number is 1,355, a decrease
of 24 percent.
In addition, I questioned the NRC leaders regarding the commission's
court-ordered work to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process.
Last year, a District of Columbia Circuit Court upheld the NRC's
statutory mandate to review and issue a decision on the license
application. The NRC has repeatedly stated it lacks the resources to do
so, yet it has not requested additional funding.
It appears the commission doesn't feel compelled to fulfill its
mandate, only to spend down to zero.
Legislation To Safeguard Open Internet Approved By Committee
On Thursday, the Energy and Commerce Committee approved legislation
that I wrote to maintain U.S.-led management of basic Internet
functions until the Government Accountability Office (GAO) studies
proposals to replace longstanding U.S. oversight.
The global Internet has run smoothly for 25 years because U.S.
oversight ensured authoritarian governments had no control over the
Internet beyond their own borders. Until the Obama Administration can
guarantee that will remain the case under the oversight of
international stakeholders, we should not surrender our role.
I introduced the DOTCOM Act
in
response to the administration's recent proposal for the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to explore ways to
remove the United States from its oversight role of the Domain Name
System (DNS) and replace it with a so-called "multistakeholder"
governance model.
My bill is a simple good government bill. Trust but verify. Since we
only get one chance to get this right, we have to make sure the Obama
Administration just doesn't just rubberstamp whatever proposal ICANN
comes up with. Oversight is important, especially with this
administration.
Lerner In Contemp: On Wednesday, I voted to recommend that the House
find Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal
Revenue Service, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a
subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform compelling her to testify about her involvement in the agency's
targeting of conservative groups from 2010 to 2013. The measure passed
the House 231-187.
Warm Welcome
Navy Chaplain LCDR Stephen Coates, right, gave the House prayer at noon
Thursday. I was pleased to welcome him to my office - and to discover
that he is originally from Greenville.
Announcement
FEMA Application Reminder: Local government entities have until July 25
to apply for funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
Pre-Disaster Mitigation program. The program provides funds for hazard
mitigation planning and the implementation of hazard mitigation
projects, such as property acquisition and structure demolition or
relocation. More information is available online

Subcommittee
Seeks
Answers
From
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
On
Wednesday,
I
chaired
a
hearing
of
the House
Energy
and
Power
Subcommittee,
which reviewed
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission&#8217;s
budget
request
and
policy
priorities.
NRC
Chairman
Allison
Macfarlane
testified
alongside
NRC
Commissioners
Kristine
Svinicki,
George
Apostolakis,
William
Magwood,
and
William
Ostendorff.
Allison
Macfarlane Subcommittee
members
questioned
the
commissioners
on
a
range
of
issues,
including
the
commission&#8217;s
increasing
budget,
pending
regulations,
and
efforts
to
restart
the
Yucca
Mountain
licensing
process.
We
also inquired about
the
NRC's
productivity
and
use
of
resources,
as
the
commission
has
requested
a
budget
increase
despite
a
decreased
workload.
I
asked how,
with
$400
million
more
dollars
and
800
more
people,
the
NRC
is
struggling
to
review
40
percent
fewer
licensing
actions.
Comparing
today&#8217;s
NRC
with
the
NRC
of
ten
years
ago
shows
how
management
efficiency
has
degraded
over
the
last
decade.
In
2004,
the
NRC
expected
the
number
of
productive
hours
from
the

to
be
1,776
per
year.
For
Fiscal
Year
2014,
that
number
is
1,355,
a
decrease
of
24
percent.
In
addition,
I
questioned
the
NRC
leaders
regarding the
commission's
court-ordered
work
to restart
the
Yucca
Mountain
licensing
process.
Last
year,
a
District
of
Columbia
Circuit
Court
upheld
the
NRC&#8217;s
statutory
mandate
to
review
and
issue
a
decision
on
the
license
application.
The
NRC
has
repeatedly
stated
it
lacks
the
resources
to
do
so,
yet
it
has
not
requested
additional
funding.
It
appears
the
commission
doesn&#8217;t
feel
compelled
to
fulfill
its

only
to
spend
down
to
zero.
