Dear Constituent,
I am
proud to have dedicated my professional career
first as an emergency
medicine physician serving the community I grew up in, and now as your
voice in Washington
to ensuring that everyone has access to high
quality, affordable healthcare. While it is not perfect and we must
continue to work together to improve its flaws, the Affordable Care Act is
an important step toward reaching this goal as a country.
In
its first year of open enrollment, millions of uninsured Americans
enrolled in insurance plans for the first time. Right here in the Inland
Empire, according to Covered California, over 122,000 of our family
members, friends, and neighbors enrolled in private insurance plans
through the state exchange. This demonstrates the tremendous need for
affordable healthcare coverage in our region, and we have made remarkable
progress in ensuring that all in our communities have access to the
care they need, but there is more that we can do.
Open
Enrollment to get health insurance in 2015 through Covered California ends
on December 15, 2014. During Open Enrollment you can browse the plans
available and pick the one that best meets your needs. To ensure that
you and your family have access to healthcare please visit the website
to learn more. Here are a few pieces of important
information.
Did you buy your insurance through Covered California last
year? Yes, and I plan on
re-enrolling next year. No,
I got my health insurance through my employer. No, but I plan on enrolling in Covered
California this year. I'm
not sure how I get my insurance. None of the above *By answering this survey, you are

If you had coverage through Covered California in 2014 you
can select the same coverage for 2015, or explore other plan options
that may be better suited to the needs of you and your
family.
You may be able to qualify for premium tax credits
and other savings, make sure to check if you
do.
If you would prefer, you can buy a plan outside of Covered
California and still meet the healthcare coverage requirements, but if
you buy outside the Marketplace, you will not be eligible for premium
tax credits or other savings based on your
income.

Raul
