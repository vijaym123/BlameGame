David -- In 2012, after
thirty-two
years in Republican hands, Brad Schneider finally won Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district for Democrats.
Now, Boehner&rsquo;s on a mission to get it back. Over the weekend, we learned Republicans will spend a stunning $1,850,000.00 to smear Brad&rsquo;s strong progressive record.
It&rsquo;s a big number, and it doesn&rsquo;t even include GOP outside groups.
Illinois is a proud Democratic state, and Brad Schneider&rsquo;s a proud Democrat. But today, Brad needs your help. Will you rush $5 or whatever you can to support Brad&rsquo;s campaign for the final sprint to Election Day? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Brad&rsquo;s opponents are hell-bent on putting this seat back in Republican hands. They want ex-Congressman Bob Dold to be their reliable yes-man.
I&rsquo;m fighting with Brad to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen. But I need you with me --
