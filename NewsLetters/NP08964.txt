&ldquo;RNC files lawsuit to raise unlimited cash&rdquo; -Associated Press, 5/23/14
Dear Friend, Citizens United
was a body blow to our campaign finance laws.
McCutcheon
was the right hook. And now a new lawsuit,
RNC v. FEC , could be the knockout punch.
If the Republican National Committee (the &ldquo;RNC&rdquo; in the lawsuit) wins this case, they&rsquo;ll be able to raise unlimited amounts of cash, just like
Citizens United
allowed super PACs to do. This case will make its way through the courts in due time, but grassroots networks like ours need to prepare for the worst. We&rsquo;re aiming for a $36,000 goal this month to close out the FEC fundraising quarter with a bang. Can you contribute $5 to get us closer to our goal?

Here in Massachusetts, lots of the political ads on TV are paid for by outside groups. Groups backed by billionaires like the Koch brothers, and masterminded by people like Karl Rove, are slowly trying to buy our political system.
That&rsquo;s not good news for grassroots campaigns, or, frankly, for anyone who believes that elections should be about addressing the issues affecting our country.
The Senate is working on a constitutional amendment to roll back
Citizens United
and
McCutcheon , but in the short term -- between now and election day -- we need to fight fire with fire. Chip in $5, $10, or whatever makes sense to you, and help us reach our $36,000 goal before the FEC filing deadline on June 30.
Thanks,
Ed
