Friends,
There has been a change of plans and I will
not be joining
Fox
News' Megyn Kelly
tonight, but I am
trying find some time in my schedule to go on The Kelly File
this week to discuss my resolution.
I'll let y'all know the date as soon as we reschedule.
I
apologize for the confusion.
Sincerely,
