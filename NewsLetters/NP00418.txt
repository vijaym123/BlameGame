Hi Friend,
The team has been in the office all weekend working, so I thought I would try to help out.
They have been planning for 2016 and really need to hit their goal of $5,000 before midnight tonight.
Can you help out?
If you could pitch in $5, $25, or whatever you can today, it would be a huge boost for the team.
Here is the link:

And remember, your contribution will be doubled with the match.
I know it&rsquo;s early for the team to be working such long hours and weekends, but if we can build a strong platform now, the better off we will be come Election day.
We only have 13 hours left.
Thanks for your help,
Janine
P.S. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to win on election night for once?
Your support today would be a huge help--click here to pitch in.
