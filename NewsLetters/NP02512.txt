Lamborn Leads Letter Raising Concern About Qatars
Record on Terrorism
Raises Questions About U.S.
Relationship with Qatar as Emir Visits the White
House
2/24/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn (R-CO),
a member of the House Armed Services Committee, is currently
circulating a letter to the Secretary of Defense Ash Carter raising concerns
that the U.S. military relationship with Qatar allows them to play both
sides. Qatar is becoming a terror-financing hub while the American
military uses their country as a major base of
operations.
As multiple news outlets have reported,
Qatar has allowed numerous individuals designated as terrorist
financiers, or even terrorist leaders, to openly operate in Qatar. The leader
of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, operates in Qatar
with impunity. Recently, a member of al-Qaeda who was captured in the
United States, was released to Qatar and welcomed home as a conquering
hero.
As the Emir of Qatar
visits the White House today, Congressman Lamborn is circulating the
letter below, detailing his concerns with Qatars activities and asking
Secretary Carter to develop a strategy to hold Qatar
accountable.
Text of
Letter
Dear Secretary
Carter,
We write to
express deep concerns that Americas military footprint in Qatar may
be enabling the Al Thani regime to offer up its territory as a
fundraising center for terrorists around the region. The past few years have
seen Qatar grow into a major hub for terrorist operatives and
terrorism finance. [i ]
The Qatari government turns a blind
eye to terrorist fundraising for Al Qaeda and the Islamic State by
U.S.-designated persons within its borders. [ii]
The Qatari government has also actively financed,
advocated for, and
at least until recently
hosted the Palestinian
terrorist group Hamas, a relationship that Doha is only being compelled
to reconsider after increased pressure from other Gulf States, not
the United States. [iii]
Qatar is now known as the
worlds safe haven for terrorist groups and militia leaders.
These
activities lead us to believe that it is time to reassess and
reevaluate the U.S. military alliance with
Qatar.
Qatar professes a commitment and a role in the coalition
against ISIS and other Islamist insurgents in the Middle East.
However, its direct role in joint air operations against ISIS was minimal in
terms of military impact. [iv]
Further, evidence suggests that Qatar has directly armed or
financed multiple Islamist groups in the region, undermining U.S.
objectives in pivotal countries such as Libya, Egypt, and Syria by pushing
those places toward violent extremism. [v]
At the same
time, Qatars efforts to curb terror finance are woefully inadequate.
Money from Qatar has been funneled to a number of terrorist groups
including both ISIS and al Qaedas Syrian affiliate Al Nusra. For
instance, the Treasury Department indicated in September that a Qatar-based
donor provided $2 million to ISISs Amir of suicide bombers. [vi]
There is no indication that
this individual has been punished by
Qatar.
Another individual based in country, Qatari national
Abd al-Rahman al-Nuaymi, has been sanctioned for providing millions of
dollars to al Qaeda affiliates in at least four different countries,
but evidently he has yet to be prosecuted or arrested by Doha for his
actions. [vii]
Nuaymi
once provided the forerunner of ISIS, al Qaeda in Iraq, with $2 million
a month; Dohas refusal to convict and lock up a seed funder of ISIS
casts doubt upon the Al Thani regimes true beliefs about fighting
Islamist terror. [viii]
Indeed, David Cohen, the U.S.
Treasury Departments Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial
Intelligence recently noted that there are U.S. and U.N.-designated
terrorist financers in Qatar that have not been acted against under Qatari
law. These include others beyond Nuaymi or financial facilitators for
Hamas. Leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamic Group,
and the Taliban have also found a safe haven in Qatar, from which they
can safely coordinate radical activities and in some cases even
terrorism in the region without interruption. [ix]
While
some of these activities are done clandestinely, Qatar has not even
attempted to hide its support of Hamas, an organization blacklisted by the
United States. As Cohen noted in March, the Qatari regime has for
many years openly financed Hamas. [x]
Qatar has
opened its doors to Hamas leadership that fled from Jordan and Syria and
provides an unfettered media platform for terrorist leaders on Al
Jazeera. Israels security forces have disrupted several plots by Hamas
operatives in the West Bank that were run out of Qatar. Qatars support
for Hamas continued even as Hamas launched a war this summer against
Israel, lobbing rockets at Israel, and attempted to massacre Israeli
civilians by means of underground tunnels while using their own civilians
and U.N. schools as shields. While there are indications that Qatar
may be reconfiguring its relationship with Hamas, much more needs to be
done.
U.S. reliance on
Qatars support such as the Al Udeid base in Qatar has emboldened the
Qataris to believe they can undermine and damage American interests and
efforts in the region without consequence. America's strategic interests
should not be undercut or held captive. Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, and
the UAE all have advanced bases which can support the same U.S.
aircraft and facilities, possibly making the need for such an extensive
installation in Qatar redundant.
We ask that you develop a strategy to hold Qatar accountable for
their support of terrorism, including a serious exploration of positioning
some of our military assets with other allies in the
region.
