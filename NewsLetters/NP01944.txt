Dear Friends,
From identity theft to Medicare and insurance fraud,
many in our community have become victims of unscrupulous scam
artists.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, Florida saw the
highest number of fraud cases per capita of any state in the nation in
2014.
March marks Fraud Protection Month, a great
opportunity to raise awareness about white collar crime, a problem which has
become a significant threat to our
community.
Throughout my years in Congress, I have tirelessly worked to stop
fraud and help all South Floridians who have been victims of fraud or
identity theft.
In an effort to combat the rising number of
Medicare and Medicaid fraud cases, I co-sponsored the Preventing and
Reducing Improper Medicare and Medicaid Expenditures Act (PRIME
Act).
This bill would enact stronger penalties for Medicare fraud,
establish stronger fraud and waste prevention strategies, and improve
the sharing of anti-fraud data across
agencies.
Unfortunately, anyone can become a victim of white collar criminals but there are
steps you can take:
Dont
give your credit card, social security number, or Medicare information
to anyone who calls you in an unsolicited
manner.
If you speak to someone who says they work for a
bank, or any other state or federal agency, do not provide them with
any personal information; instead call them back at a contact number
provided in your bills or on the organizations official
websites.
Never give personal information
over the phone to anyone claiming to work for the IRS.
The IRS
only communicates with taxpayers by mail.
Regularly check your financial statements for any
unauthorized charges.
By remaining vigilant and ensuring your
personal information is safe, you can protect yourself from those who
wish to do you financial harm.
You may also reach out to my
office for help or information at 305-668-2285.
Together,
we can help stop fraud before it
happens.
NOTE: In an effort to help consumers, the Florida Department of Financial
Services is hosting a series of fraud-prevention workshops to educate
Floridians about potential scams and help members of our community
keep more of their hard earned money.
