Carper's Connection
July
23, 2014
Dear
Friends,
Since becoming Chairman of
the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs
Committee last year, I have
held countless discussions,
numerous hearings, and made
several visits to the
southern and northern borders
and Central America to study
the challenges and
complexities driving unlawful
migration to the United
States.
The current situation
along our southern border is
a large and complex
humanitarian challenge that
requires immediate attention
and resources. President
Obama and Department of
Homeland Security Secretary
Jeh Johnson have dispatched
an all-hands-on-deck,
government-wide response
effort to help manage the
surge of unaccompanied minors
from the Central American
countries of Honduras, El
Salvador, and Guatemala.
In recent weeks, the
Administration has sent more
agents and judges to the
border, expanded its ability
to hold families, and
implemented an educational
campaign in Central America
to warn would-be migrants and
their families about the
risks involved in the
journey. Now, Congress needs
to do its job and work in the
near-term to stop this surge
by approving the
Presidents
request for emergency
funding
to provide
additional resources for
agencies responding to the
crisis.
But too often, we only
treat the symptoms of a
problem and fail to address
the underlying factors. While
Congress and the
Administration need to
address this immediate influx
of individuals and families
coming to our
borders,the U.S. and
our partnersincluding
Mexico, Colombia, the
multilateral development
banks, the private sector,
and institutions of
faithalso need to help
those countries address those
underlying factors, or root
causes, that are pushing so
many of their young people
and families to attempt the
trip.
Over the past two weeks,
Ive chaired two
hearings to examine this
surge of Central American
migration:
The first hearing, "
Challenges
at the Border: Examining
the Causes, Consequences,
and Responses to the Rise
in Apprehensions at the
Southern Border
examined the impact that
the surge in migration from
Central
Americaincluding
unprecedented numbers of
unaccompanied minors and
familieshave had on
our frontline
agencies.Witnesses
from six federal agencies
laid out the
Administrations
interagency response to the
current humanitarian
challenge at our southern
border with Mexicoand
its recent emergency
supplemental budget
request.
Last
Wednesday,our
hearing, "
Challenges
at the Border: Examining
and Addressing the Root
Causes Behind the Rise in
Apprehensions at the
Southern Border ,
examined the root causes
that are pushing people
from Central America to
undertake the dangerous
trip to the U.S., including
the increasing violence and
lack of economic
opportunity and jobs in the
region. It also explored
what needs to be done to
foster stability and
socioeconomic growth in the
region so that Central
Americans arent
compelled to leave
including restoring the
rule of law, lowering
energy costs, improving
education and workforce
skills and stimulating
access to capital.
As Congress and the
Administration continue to
deliberate this issue, I
encourage you to send me your
views on this issue, or any
other, through
email
