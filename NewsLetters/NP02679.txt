Representative

Perry
February
22 , 2015
This week I hosted a town meeting at the Eureka Volunteer Fire and Ambulance Company in Stewartstown. It was great to see over 100 constituents in attendance. We discussed issues facing the U.S. Congress and America like the federal budget, job creation, homeland and national security, and immigration.
These town meeting are invaluable for me to effectively represent you in Congress. I regularly need
and seek - your feedback on all of the issues facing our country. This town meeting continues my efforts to solicit your feedback. I've met with hundreds of constituents via individual meetings and site visits, conducted regular in-person town and tele-town meetings throughout the 4th Congressional District, and aggressively utilize social media to interact with you.
Future town meetings will be announced shortly. If you're unable to attend these upcoming meetings in person but would like to speak with me, please contact any of our offices to schedule a meeting.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
