Congressman Veasey Votes In Favor of Short-Term Highway Bill
Veasey votes in favor of H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015
Washington, D.C.Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, issued the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 2353, the
Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015, which would provide a short-term extension for our federal highway and transit funding programs:
Today I voted in favor of passing the H.R. 2353, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 in order to provide a short-term funding extension before funding expires on May 31.
Right here in North Texas, the Texas Department of Transportation needs support from both sides of the aisle to ensure Texas can continue work on long-term projects like the Horseshoe Project near downtown Dallas and to ensure residents can continue to utilize reliable public transit services like Dallas Area Rapid Transit, which serves thousands in the DFW Metroplex.
As our nation approaches one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, this short-term patch will provide Congress with enough time to develop a long-term bill that will allow Texas and states across the nation to get to work on repairing our nations crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems. This temporary patch is only the first step; Congress must utilize the upcoming months to put together a bipartisan, long term transportation bill that adequately funds our transportation infrastructure for years to come.
