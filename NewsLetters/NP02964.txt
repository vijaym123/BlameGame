If you thought the amount of money spent in the 2014 elections was obscene, fasten your seatbelts because we&rsquo;re in for a rough ride:
Last week, the oil billionaire Koch Brothers pledged to spend $889 million for Republicans in the 2016 elections.
Forget for just a moment all the schools we could build, or the crumbling roads and bridges we could start to repair, or the medical research on Alzheimer&rsquo;s or autism that we could invest in with that ginormous amount of money.
The deep-down point is that if we thought the playing field was tilted against us last year, it&rsquo;s only going to be worse in the next election.
So here we are. We can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back.
Me?
I&rsquo;m fighting back&mdash;and I&rsquo;m getting started right now. I want to show the Koch Brothers that we&rsquo;re ready to fight. So I&rsquo;m asking you to sign my petition now to commit to restoring the Democratic Majority.
The Koch Brothers aren&rsquo;t the only ones we have to worry about. Last week, Republican political operatives linked to Mitch McConnell and Karl Rove launched a new SuperPAC with one goal (and I quote):
&ldquo;To protect and expand the Republican Senate Majority when Harry Reid, Elizabeth Warren and their army of left-wing activists try to take it back in 2016.&rdquo;
The Republicans are right: That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re going to do. We&rsquo;ll never be able to outspend the Koch Brothers or Karl Rove on the airwaves, but we can build a grassroots team that&rsquo;s ready to fight for what we believe in. We can fight, and we can win.
We didn&rsquo;t build this country so that it would work only for the millionaires and billionaires and giant corporations. We will not abandon this country to a bunch of Republicans who say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got mine, the rest of you are on your own.&rdquo;
We&rsquo;re a country that believes we make the investments together so the next kid can get ahead, and the kid after that. And we&rsquo;re going to take on Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers so that every kid gets a fighting chance.
Please help us get started. Names&mdash;thousands of names and millions of names&mdash;matter. Sign my petition to show Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers that you&rsquo;re committed to taking back the Senate in 2016 and standing up to the powerful interests trying to buy our elections. We need you to be a part of this.
Thank you,
Elizabeth Warren
