Dear Friend,
Last week, the House came together and passed the "Success and
Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act" to expand charter
school access. This legislation would facilitate the establishment of
more charter schools and makes improvements to the Charter School
Program to encourage states to expand their use of charter schools.
In addition to the great public schools in my district, there are six
charter schools serving local communities. This week, I had the
opportunity to visit the Magellan Charter School in Raleigh. I was
pleased to see their innovative and creative approach to educating our
young students.
Not every child is the same, and each child learns and grows in a
different way. Every family deserves to have choices when it comes to
education - we've learn that a "one-size-fits-all" approach simply
doesn't work. Charter schools give students and their parents the
opportunity to select a school that best fits their needs.
Sincerely,
George Holding

Dear
Friend,
Last
week,
the
House
came
together
and
passed
the
"Success
and
Opportunity
through
Quality
Charter
Schools
Act"
to
expand
charter
school
access.
This
legislation
would
facilitate
the
establishment
of
more
charter
schools
and
makes
improvements
to
the
Charter
School
Program
to
encourage
states
to
expand
their
use
of
charter
schools.
In
addition
to
the
great
public
schools
in
my
district,
there
are
six
charter
schools
serving
local
communities.
This
week,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
Magellan
Charter
School
in
Raleigh.
I
was
pleased
to
see
their
innovative
and
creative
approach
to
educating
our
young
students.
Not
every
child
is
the
same,
and
each

Every

deserves
to
have

when
it

-
we've
learn
that
a

approach
simply
doesn't

Charter
schools
give
students
and
their
parents
the
opportunity
to
select
a
school
that
best
fits
their
needs.
