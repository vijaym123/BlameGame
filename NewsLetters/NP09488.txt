I know a lot of Americans,
and Delawareans, enjoy
Memorial Day weekend on the
water or at the barbeque, and
Id like to wish you
and yours a great weekend
filled with family and fun.
However, I hope you take a
moment or two to remember the
somber nature of this
holiday.
Each year, we dedicate one
day to reflecting on and
thanking the men and women
who made the ultimate
sacrifice in protecting our
nation. We should also
remember the veterans who are
still with us and serve as
living testaments to the
sacrifices that our service
men and women make for us
each and every day.
So please join me in
saying, Thank
You, to the warriors
who have fallen and to our
veterans still with us
today.
