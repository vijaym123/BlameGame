Changing
Washington, Reducing Spending
Once again,
Congress was faced with a debt limit increase last week that did not
contain a single measure to help get our spending under control.
Thats simply the wrong prescription when it comes to ensuring a
strong economic future.
After the last five years of big-government
ideas from the White House and the Senate, it is clearer than ever that
simply spending money is not going to fix our problems.
We have begun to change the conversation in Washington, and
have made progress on the debt and deficit.
Since becoming the
majority in the House, Republicans have cut $165 billion in
spending.
But thats not nearly enough.
We need further
meaningful and serious changes to the spending status quo.
Washington must start asking the question: is this program important enough
to continue borrowing from China and other nations and loading debt on
future generations?
We need to get a handle on our
spending problem and we ought to be working to set the table for
economic growth.
Simply passing debt increase after debt increase
with no meaningful cuts to spending is not the
answer.
Instead, to restore confidence in our economy, we must confront our debt
head on, and reverse the pattern of deficit spending.
We can no
longer continue to kick trillion dollar deficits down the
road.
We did not get $17 trillion in debt overnight and we will
not solve the problem with one vote.
But it must start
somewhere.

Sincerely,
Sam Graves
