Dear Friend,
Today, our nation pauses to remember the sacrifices that have been made by our veteransevery man and woman who proudly defended our country. To a brave few, duty and service are more than words, they are a way of life.
As Americans, our freedoms and liberties have been secured because of our veterans.
From the Continental Armies of the American Revolution to those returning home today from places abroad, our veterans have proven, time and again, to be among our greatest national treasures.
As President John F. Kennedyhimself an American war heroonce said, A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces, but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.
Today, and every day, please join me in remembering and honoring our veterans.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
