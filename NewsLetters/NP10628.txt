Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
Every day hard-working, middle-class families and small business owners
from the 2nd District of Missouri create budgets, set priorities and
live within their means. Yet Washington Democrats insist on borrowing
more money from China by writing blank checks on the backs of our
children and grandchildren.
With our national debt now exceeding $17 trillion, this is no longer
just an economic issue - it is a moral issue as well.
Especially since
every child born today is saddled with more than $52,000 in debt.
As a
mother of three children, I see that reality as tragically
unacceptable.
In March of 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said, "Leadership means
that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden
of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.
America has a debt and a failure of leadership."
Mr. President, no
truer words have ever been spoken, but like many declarations coming
out of Washington, talk is cheap.
The path to prosperity for the American people means a responsible,
balanced budget that grows the economy and creates opportunity. This
week, the House passed the Ryan Budget, which will ensure that America's
best days are not behind her, but on the horizon for a better tomorrow.
To learn more about the House Republican budget, please watch my weekly
video below discussing this common-sense vision to protect the American
Dream.
Do you believe Congress needs to pass a budget that balances?

As always, it is an honor to serve you and I look forward to speaking
with you again soon.

Tables
carry
NO
style
declarations.
Only
declare
border,
cellspacing,
width,
bgcolor
(background

and
alignment
attributes
to
a

Think
of
the

as
providing

place
within
it.

added

This

COMMENT:
The
TD
is
where
you

text-alignment
(left/right/centered)

a

COMMENT:
By
declaring
a
default

you
avoid

paragragh,
DIV
(Division),

in
your
content.
COMMENT:
You
may
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the
HTML
code
of
this

table
you
will
see
how
these
concepts
are
being

COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of
style,
size
and
table
attributes
that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
shorter
tables
on
top
of

to
form
one
very
long
series
of
tables
and
avoid
the

Dear
Friend,
Every

hard-working,
middle-class
families
and
small
business
owners
from
the
2nd

budgets,
set
priorities

Yet
Washington
Democrats insist
on borrowing
more
money
from
China by writing
blank
checks
on
the
backs
of
our
children
and
grandchildren.
With
our
national
debt
now
exceeding
$17
trillion,
this
is
no
longer
just
an
economic
issue
&#8211;
it
is
a
moral
issue
as
well.
Especially
since
every
child
born
today
is
saddled
with
more
than
$52,000
in
debt.
As
a
mother
of
three
children,
I
see
that
reality
as
tragically
unacceptable.
In
March
of
2006,
then-Senator
Barack
Obama
said,
&#8220;Leadership
means
that
&#8216;the
buck
stops
here.&#8217;
Instead,
Washington
is
shifting
the
burden
of
bad
choices
today
onto
the
backs
of

grandchildren.
America

Mr.

The

This

the
