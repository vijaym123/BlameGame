Veterans Deserve Our Gratitude
We are a blessed nation indeed. Throughout our more than 237-year history, countless men and women have selflessly answered the call to protect our freedom and preserve liberty by serving in the military. On Veterans Day, we remember these individuals, their bravery and sacrifice. As we commemorate those who have come before to secure and preserve independence, honor those currently serving to keep us safe and as we support military families in our neighborhoods, join me in showing your appreciation.
True patriotism is embodied in the lives of our military and their families. Their service cannot be understated and must never be taken for granted. While numerous individuals have protected and fought for freedom, it wasnt until after World War I that we set apart a special day just to say thank you.
Celebrating our veterans on November 11th serves as a reminder of the hard-won victories of the past. During World War I, the United States joined our allies with the resolve for peace in Europe. Tens of thousands of courageous Americans were lost before the armistice between Germany and Allied Nations on November 11, 1918. After more than four years of violence and devastating losses, this ceasefire brought temporary reconciliation.
We still remember the sacrifices of those patriots, and their memories live on. Unfortunately, this was not the end of war during the last century. Many others responded to the call to serve during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars. And each one served with honor.
Today, there are more than 21 million veterans living in the United States and more than 1.4 million serving on active duty. We are forever indebted to them for their service, and they deserve our continuous support and appreciation.
For veterans of all ages, it is important that we protect their earned benefits for their selfless service. Many return from war forever changed, and it is sometimes difficult to adjust to life back home. In fact, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have a higher rate of unemployment than the general population. Others suffer from anxiety disorders.
Military service doesnt just impact those in the line of fire. Spouses and children of service members desperately need the support and love of their friends and neighbors, especially when their loved ones are deployed for long periods of time. But that support system is especially critical when service members dont return home.
Ronald Reagan once said, "History teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap." Few can understand the true price of the freedoms we enjoy every day because its not a fight that has been experienced firsthand. However, one thing is and always will be certain. It is because of those who are ready and willing to serve and sacrifice for the common good that we continue to be the greatest nation on earth.
The contributions of our military deserve more than one day to celebrate. But this Veterans Day, as we honor all members of our dedicated military, past and present, please join me in saying Thank you for your service.
Sincerely,
Tom Cole
