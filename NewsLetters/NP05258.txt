UNTIL 5:59PM: All Donations
Triple-Matched President Obama and President Clinton asked for your help.
Now until 5:59PM, we&rsquo;re making an emergency extension of the Triple-Match for today&rsquo;s huge ad buy deadline. Can you help?
What should we do?
Two new polls -- POLITICO and FOX NEWS -- show Democrats have pulled in to a dead-heat.
But -- Boehner is throwing EVERYTHING he has at us.
The Republicans will spend $2O,OOO,OOO against us in just 1 week.
That kind of cash will crush our chances. And we&rsquo;re overextended as-is.
So we don&rsquo;t have any other option: we&rsquo;re making an emergency extension of the triple-match
UNTIL THE 6PM AD BUY DEADLINE .
Please. Please, David. We still need 18,OOO more donations to fight Republicans&rsquo; ad blitz. Can you chip in right now?
