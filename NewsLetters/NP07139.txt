$50,000 was awarded to the Commonwealth Health Care Corporation from USDA for submitting a winning application under Rural Developments Community Facilities grant program, which will fund the purchase of much-needed beds.
I was very happy to join Mr. Joseph Diego of USDAs Guam field office for the presentation of grant award to CHCC management. Funding for community facilities program is part of Rural Development appropriations approved by Congress.
Congratulations CHCC!
$68,918 awarded to CHCC for disease prevention and capacity-building activities
The Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-borne, and enteric disease program awarded $68,918 to CHCC to provide for the expanded prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public sector health care costs and to increase capacity to reduce emerging infectious disease (EID) threats. The programs play a critical role in strengthening the national infectious disease infrastructure through collaborative efforts between state and local health departments, CDC programs, and other stakeholders to improve the ability to detect and respond to EIDs and other public health threats. Congratulations to CHCC!

$164,973 awarded for tsunami preparedness
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) awarded the CNMI Office of Homeland Security $164,973 under the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program to update the tsunami evacuation maps, signage, and to produce additional tsunami awareness materials for Rota, Tinian and Saipan. The updates will enable first responders and emergency personnel to have accurate evacuation information to mitigate actions against the risks of tsunamis, as well as efficiency in public evacuation procedures. The grant will also be used for training and exercises to ensure that evacuation plans are sufficient to reduce tsunami risks. Congratulations to the Office of Homeland Security!

$929,000 awarded for coastal zone management
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded $929,000 to the CNMI Division of Coastal Resources Management to help administer the Commonwealth's federally approved coastal management program that focuses on protecting, restoring, and reasonably developing our communities along the beaches. These funds will support jobs and address many important issues including climate change adaptation, coastal hazards planning, and public access protection. The grant award also supports a new initiative in ocean resource management planning. Congratulations to DCRM!
