Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Saturday, I welcomed the first of the refreshing fall weather as I went out to Clermont to encourage runners and congratulate the winners in the Miles for Meals fundraising run. The Church at South Lake, who hosted the run, has been very involved in helping the Buses n' Backpack effort to raise money to feed children facing poverty and homelessness. After the run, I was honored to participate in the American Legion Post 55 parade before the flag retirement ceremony in Clermont.

Last week, I spent a day in Sorrento, visiting local businesses and shops, and meeting with members of the community. Tonya Hodak, the owner of Cool Cuts Hot Tans, showed me her salon, introduced her hairdressers, and took me next door to visit Gigi's Italian Restaurant. Many of the business men and women we met also came to the East Lake County Chamber luncheon that afternoon, where I shared an update on federal issues and answered questions from these local business leaders.
Another visit I made in Sorrento was JA Croson LLC, a plumbing and HVAC company in Lake County. Currently employing 450 people, their leadership team arranged a reception in the conference room to provide an opportunity for their employees to make comments and ask questions. One of their employees, Tina, made an incredible cake for the occasion.
Some of my other stops in Sorrento included:
- Ace Hardware
- Catherine Hanson Real Estate, Inc
- East Lake County Library
- East Lake Historical Museum

Last Tuesday, I hosted neighborhood listening sessions in the Kings Ridge and Summit Greens communities. During the past few months, it has been an honor to visit so many local gatherings, community groups, and service organizations to share what is happing on a district level, as well as within our country and around the world.
This week, I visited several other groups, including:
- Leesburg Sunrise Rotary Club
- Kiwanis Club of Clermont
- Orlando Evening Rotary Club
- North Orlando Kiwanis Luncheon
- Dr. Phillips MetroWest Chamber of Commerce Friday Leads Group

On Thursday, I joined Florida Secretary of Transportation Ananth Prasad, Winter Haven Mayor Nathanael Birdsong, City Manager Deric Feacher and other local officials for the grand opening of the Central Florida Intermodal Logistics Center. This transportation system to move freight by rail will generate both jobs and economic growth, and I am excited for the expanded opportunities it is bringing to Winter Haven and the rest of the Central Florida region.

It was a beautiful morning on Friday when I met Jim Atchison, the President and CEO of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, to take a behind the scenes tour of the park and meet their animal caretakers, watch their trainers in action, and see the successful wildlife rescue, education, and conservation services they provide at their own expense.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Orlando, whose son is a missionary, contacted me regarding a nonimmigrant visa petition for a 14 year old girl from Cambodia with a rare vascular growth disorder. The missionary had been trying to help her receive treatment and the necessary medical care. Although a center in Denver was willing to provide her care for free, they were running into delays with the visa.
My office reached out to the U.S. Embassy and was informed that they were aware of the situation and working to resolve the scheduling issues. They assured my office that the visa request for the girl and her father would be given every consideration possible under U.S. immigration law. I was happy to receive confirmation from the constituent that the visa had been approved.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Last week, the second nurse from Texas Presbyterian Hospital was diagnosed with Ebola after helping to treat the patient who died from the virus. Considering the severity and contagious nature of the virus, do you believe that we should ban flights from certain African countries plagued with Ebola?

Legislative Update:
One of the main reasons that I went to Washington was to get our fiscal house in order. The year I began serving, our deficit was $1.3 trillion. The year before that it was $1.2 trillion. Astoundingly, the federal government was borrowing almost forty cents for every dollar it spent.
Since then
each year I have been in Congress
we have reduced spending and the federal deficit has decreased. None of it was easy. The first year, the House of Representatives struggled to reverse the upward climb and inch our way onto a path toward a balanced budget. Little by little, progress was achieved.
Just this last week, I received the most recent Treasury report on fiscal year 2014, which ended on September 30th. The amount of deficit spending is the lowest since I came to Congress in 2011, coming in at $483 billion. During the time I have been in office, our deficit has decreased by 63%. This is not great news compared to where we need to be, but it is good news relative to where we were previously. We have continued to shrink our borrowing for the last four years.
