Let's Be Sure Trade Works for Ohio
With over a quarter of Ohio manufacturing jobs dependent on exports,
workers on factory floors across our state benefit when we export
world-class 'Made in America' products. Workers at Timken in Canton
export more than half of their Ohio-made bearings. Auto workers in
Northwest Ohio export all over the world, including exporting more than
137,000 Toledo-made Jeep Cherokees and Wranglers last year, more than a
quarter of production. Ohio soybean farmers that I visited with
recently export more than 60 percent of their crop. Ohio exports
support good-paying jobs here at home.
But while we push to export more 'Made in America' goods and
services around the world, we've got to be sure we have a more level
playing field for our workers and farmers. This includes more
aggressive enforcement of current trade laws against unfair practices
and new laws to support American jobs. One new law needed is to stop
other countries from manipulating their currency.
Recently, I received a letter signed by thousands of Ohio auto workers
at Ford facilities that called currency manipulation "the most critical
barrier in the 21st century." Those words were from workers at Ford's
Transmission Plant in Sharonville, which I visited not too long ago. I
also received a similar letter from Ford workers in Avon Lake and Lima
with the very same concerns.
Given these concerns, I authored
legislation that cracks down on currency manipulation, which hurts
American workers by making our exports more expensive while our
competitors' exports into the U.S. are cheaper. That's a raw deal for
American workers. I am pleased to be joined in this fight by American
workers and manufacturers like Ford, GM, U.S. Steel, Nucor, AK Steel
and others.
You can read more about our efforts here
.
I am also working with steelworkers and manufacturers to change the law
so they can more easily get help when dealing with undersold and
subsidized imports. My bipartisan amendment
with Senator Sherrod Brown was approved by the Finance Committee
last week and will be debated on the Senate floor soon. I am also
pleased by important progress on legislation I worked on
with Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) to crack down on customs duty
evasion schemes through the ENFORCE Act, to ensure our competitors
aren't illegally skirting import laws.
Since being sworn in to the Senate, I have heard firsthand from workers
whose factories have been adversely impacted by the illegal trade
practices of foreign competitors. With so much to gain from growing
U.S. exports, we cannot let countries get away with gaming the system
at the expense of American manufacturing workers. This is exactly why I
have stood side-by-side with Ohio workers in dozens of trade
enforcement cases to ensure they are protected from illegal practices
targeting U.S. jobs.
Recently I was in Northwest Ohio meeting with United Steelworkers
(USW) to discuss the challenges they faced from imported Chinese tires
that allegedly break trade laws. In response to these concerns, I sent
a letter to the Secretary of Commerce and called on the Administration
to vigorously investigate this case and stand up for USW workers in
Ohio. This case has nationwide economic impacts and would adversely
affect hundreds of hard-working Ohioans.
This important tire case comes on the heels of two important trade
victories in 2014 for Ohio workers. Last year I worked with Senator
Brown to support Ohio pipe and tube workers in Cleveland and the
Mahoning Valley who are manufacturing parts to support the energy
renaissance taking place in our state. We successfully won trade
enforcement cases against a number of countries, including China, that
were illegally underselling and subsidizing their products. That
followed trade enforcement wins for Ohio workers who manufacture hot
rolled steel, washing machines, candles and rebar.
While we crack down on illegal practices by our competitors and expand
exports, we must also stand up for our allies. The right approach for
Ohio is to export more which creates good jobs and crack down on unfair
trade practices. With that balance, Ohio workers and farmers win. That's
why I worked on a bipartisan amendment with Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.)
on legislation aimed at combatting the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment
and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Over the past several years, a growing
contingency of countries have sought to isolate and delegitimize Israel
through BDS. This amendment leverages ongoing trade negotiations to
discourage prospective U.S. trade partners from engaging in economic
discrimination against Israel. I am happy to report that our bipartisan
amendment to Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) successfully passed the
Senate Finance Committee
last week. Now we need to be sure it is part of the final TPA
bill.
While we work to expand exports and create more jobs, we must also be
sure that we are ready to do all in our power to crack down on and hold
foreign trade partners accountable when they break the rules.
Around the Buckeye State
Recently met with workers at TimkenSteel in Canton after the exciting
unveiling of their Jumbo Vertical Caster.
I had the opportunity to visit Sinclair Community College to talk to
the Dayton Chamber annual meeting about ways to help Ohio small
businesses succeed.
It was inspiring to stop by and talk to a Stark State College class
certifying drug counselors to help those struggling with drug
addiction.
I visited with the successful JTM Food Group in Harrison to discuss
ways we can reduce barriers to small business growth.
I recently returned from a fact-finding trip to Ukraine, a year after
my colleague Senator Cardin and I led a Congressional delegation to
monitor last year's presidential election. Ukraine has reached a
pivotal moment. Ukrainians have made incredible sacrifices in the hopes
of securing a democratic future but need sustained economic, political,
and military support from the United States and NATO to ensure the
success of this hopeful vision. Earlier this month, I met with members
of the Ukrainian and other Eastern European communities in Cleveland to
talk about my visit. Many have family members in Ukraine and share my
concerns about continued Russian aggression.
I had the opportunity to thank the 1/3 HBCT in Latvia for their
dedication and sacrifice. They play a key role in supporting NATO
allies. Here we are in front of a Lima,Ohio-built Abrams tank I got to
ride in during a training mission.

But

we've
got
to
be

This
includes
more
aggressive
enforcement
of
current

against

and
new
laws
to
support

One
new

is
to

I
also
received
a

with
the
very
same
concerns.
Given
these
concerns,
I
authored
legislation
that
cracks

on
currency
manipulation,
which
hurts
American
workers
by
making
our
exports
more
expensive
while
our
competitors'
exports
into

U.S.
are
cheaper. That&#8217;s
a
raw
deal
for
American
workers. I
am
pleased
to
be
joined
in
this
fight
by
American
workers
and

Since
being
sworn
in
to
the
Senate,
I
have
heard
firsthand
from
workers
whose
factories
have
been
adversely
impacted
by
the
illegal
trade
practices
of
foreign
competitors.
With
so
much
to
gain
from
growing
U.S.
exports,
we
cannot
let
countries
get
away
with
gaming
the
system
at
the
expense
of
American
manufacturing
workers.
This
is
exactly
why
I
have
stood
side-by-side
with
Ohio
workers
in
dozens
of
trade
enforcement
cases
to
ensure
they
are
protected
from
illegal
practices
targeting
U.S.
jobs.
Recently
I
was
in
Northwest
Ohio
meeting
with
United
Steelworkers
(USW)
to
discuss
the
challenges
they
faced
from
imported
Chinese
tires
that
allegedly
break
trade
laws.
In
response
to
these
concerns,
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
Secretary
of
Commerce
and
called
on
the
Administration
to
vigorously
investigate
this
case
and
stand
up
for
USW
workers
in
Ohio.
This
case
has
nationwide
economic
impacts
and
would
adversely
affect
hundreds
of
hard-working
Ohioans.
This
important
tire
case
comes
on
the
heels
of
two
important
trade
victories
in
2014
for
Ohio
workers.
Last
year
I
worked
with
Senator
Brown

pipe

and

We
successfully
won
trade

cases
against
a

of
countries,
including
China,
that
were
illegally

their

That
followed
trade
enforcement
wins
for
Ohio
workers
who
manufacture
hot

steel,
washing
machines,
candles
and
rebar.
While
we
crack
down
on
illegal
practices
by
our
competitors
and
expand
exports,
we
must
also
stand
up
for
our
allies. The
right
approach
for
Ohio
is
to
export
more
which
creates
good
jobs
and
crack
down
on
unfair
trade
practices.
With
that
balance,
Ohio
workers
and
farmers
win.
That&#8217;s
why
I
worked
on
a
bipartisan

with
Senator
Ben
