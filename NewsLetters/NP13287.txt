Obamacare
Oversight
One of the larger -- though too frequently understated --
concerns with the implementation of Obamacare has been the threat of
a breakdown in the security of information shared on the exchange
systems and the website Healthcare.gov. From frequent failures in the
website's operations coupled with admissions by the Obama administration
that security reviews prior to launch were less than complete, it is
incumbent upon Congress to get to the bottom of any information security
threats that might exist.
Health care is innately personal, and the information that one must share
with the government in abiding by the mandates to carry insurance is
itself personal and ought to remain as such. That is why, in the House
of Representatives, we are preparing this week to act on legislation
requiring immediate notification to an individual of any security
breach that might have occurred and resulted in someone attaining unlawful
access to that individual's personal
information.
This is a small step but part of a larger
Obamacare oversight effort in the House of Representatives that will continue
in the days ahead. In the end, what's needed is to replace this law
that empowers Washington with one that empowers patients, families, and
physicians to access quality, affordable care. That can be done and
must be done so that not only one's personal health care information
but his or her personal health care decisions are
protected.
