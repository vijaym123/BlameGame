WASHINGTON
&#8211; Congressman John J. Duncan, Jr. (R-Tenn.) was ranked the most conservative
Member of Tennessee&#8217;s Congressional delegation Friday by the Nation&#8217;s leading grassroots conservative organization.
The American Conservative Union (ACU) gave Duncan a 96-percent score for his voting record in 2013, higher than any other federal Representative in
Congress from Tennessee.
The score is based on 25 votes taken in the House of Representatives on conservative issues in 2013.
U.S. Senators were scored on 25 separate conservative votes in the Senate.
&#8220;The American Conservative Union represents the traditional conservative views of free markets, constitutionally limited government, individual liberty,
and living within our means,&#8221; Duncan said. &#8221;Massive foreign aid, endless wars, nation-building, and big brother government go against every traditional conservative position I have ever known, and I am glad the American Conservative Union recognizes the true
definition of conservatism.&#8221;
ACU&#8217;s score of Congress differs from others that emphasize single areas like taxes, defense, or social policy; scored votes are not announced in advance
and cover a wide range of conservative issues before Congress.
&#8220;If other Members of Congress had voted the way I have over the years we would have very little debt at all if any, and this country would be booming
beyond belief,&#8221; Duncan continued.
&#8220;Under this administration, the role of government continues to grow and infringe on our freedoms. It is important we have strong principled members
in Congress like Rep. Duncan to take this agenda head-on,&#8221; said ACU Chairman Al Cardenas.
The 2013 report is the 43rd edition of the conservative ratings guide, which ACU began issuing in 1971.
