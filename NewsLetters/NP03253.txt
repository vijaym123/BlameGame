Friend
Have you heard about
H.RES.24 ? This resolution, which Im cosponsoring, would amend the House rules so that the names of fallen servicemembers would be read aloud on the House floor each month. That way, on the first legislative day of every month, the men and women in uniform who died in combat the previous month would be honored on the House floor.
I think this resolution is important -- not only because it honors the men and women in uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice -- but also because it reminds Members of Congress and citizens alike that
freedom is not free . Our liberty comes at a cost. And the men and women in uniform who fight for our freedom are the greatest heroes our nation will ever know.
Yours in service,
Randy
