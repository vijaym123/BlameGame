REVIEW
Thanks to all of the Arkansans who stopped by
my office this week.
It was great to meet with Dr. Burris from
Fort Smith, Matt Wilkins from Fayetteville, Dr. Gunter, Dr. McClure,
and Dr. Endel of the Arkansas Association of Supervision and Curriculum
Development, Terry Sheeler and Patricia Thompson representing the
National Federation of the Blind of Arkansas, and Dr. Pillow-Price, Brad
Planey, and Nichetra Magee, advocates for the Arkansas Home Visiting
Network.
Hope you enjoyed your time in
Washington.
On
Tuesday, the House passed
H.R. 7 , the No Taxpayer
Funding for Abortion Act, with a bipartisan vote of 227-188.
This legislation enacts a permanent ban on the use of all federal
dollars to fund abortions and eliminates tax credits and subsidies for
Obamacare health plans that include elective abortion coverage.
I
support life and strongly believe that people who morally object to
abortion shouldn't have to finance it.
I am proud to have supported
this legislation as a cosponsor and with my vote.
On Tuesday
evening, President Obama delivered his fifth State of the Union
address to the nation before a joint session of Congress.
In it, the
President called for a year of action and asked whether we in Congress
are going to help or hinder Americas progress.
Unfortunately, Im afraid our nation cant take much more of the top-down,
government-expanding action and progress for which hes calling.
I
know for certain that Arkansass Third District cant; I hear it from
you, my constituents, day after day.
House Republicans agree we need
a year of action, and thats what weve been working on in the
House.
Our focus remains on plans to create jobs, grow the economy, and
empower people, not the government.
If the President is
serious, he should join us as we work to lower health care costs, improve
education, and help Americans take home more of their
paychecks.
My sister and Atkins High School Principal, Margaret
Robinson, accompanied me to the address.

Thanks for
being my guest and visiting me in Washington!
On Wednesday,
House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (KY-5) appointed me to serve
as vice chairman of the House Appropriations Labor, Health and Human
Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.
I will
continue to serve on the Defense and Financial Services and General
Government subcommittees, in addition to serving as vice
chairman.

floor speech

Labor-H provides the funding for and oversight of
federal programs that impact every single American.
But in this time
of limited resources and as we work to successfully address our
nations spending problem, the thorough evaluation of these programs
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, education, and Social Security
is essential to ensuring their sustainability and efficiency.
As
this subcommittees vice chairman, I am honored to be given this
responsibility and challenge as
we work towards our goal to complete
the entire committee's work for 2015 on time and in regular
order.
Wednesday afternoon, the House passed the
farm bill
conference report, which authorizes federal
agriculture programs for five years, with a bipartisan vote of 251-166.
The report cuts $23 billion in mandatory spending, including $8 billion
from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, and makes
important reforms to farm and food programs.
The farm bill
was far from perfect, but in divided government
each side has to find
common ground.
Ultimately, this report
like many of the other
bipartisan agreements that have been signed into law
moves the ball
forward by making much-needed reforms to federal programs and reducing
spending.

bill

On Thursday, northwest Arkansas
was honored with a visit from the 35 th
Commandant of
the United States Marine Corps, General Jim Amos.
General Amos
spoke at the Northwest Arkansas Summit and visited Walmartto discuss the
issue of diversity integration, particularly gender integration in
the workplace, and about Walmarts commitment to
veterans.
Today, the Arkansas Municipal League is wrapping up its Winter
Conference, and as former mayor and member of the League, as well as their
"Person of the Year," I was honored to speak to them today.
Great
cities truly do make great states, and I am extremely grateful for all
of the work the League and these leaders do for ours.
This
afternoon, I swung by Bonnie Grimes Elementary to join their
Groundhogs Day Celebration!
Thanks for including me in the
fun.
From the
Front...
