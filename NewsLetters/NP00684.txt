This Memorial Day, let us honor all the men and women who have given their lives in defense of our nation, reflect on the valor of our fallen American heroes, and offer our gratitude to all those past and present who have answered the call to serve.
I hope you have a pleasant Memorial Day with your family and loved ones. On this day and all others, may we recognize that our freedoms have come at great cost and must never be taken for granted.
