Dear Friend,
Tomorrow marks the
twentieth anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act being signed into law.
This act is monumental legislation that strengthens our commitment
against domestic violence. Every woman deserves to be free from the
threat of violence in public spaces, the workplace, and especially in her
own home.
In the twenty years since this legislation was
signed into law every level of law enforcement has been provided the
tools to investigate and prosecute domestic and sexual violence at a much
higher rate. However, our work on this issue is not complete. We must
come together as a society and take a stand against all instances of
domestic violence wherever it is exists because even just one case is
too many.
Sincerely,
Congressman
