Background information from the Energy and
Commerce Committee
H.R. 6 will expedite exports of U.S.
liquefied natural gas (LNG) to our allies. Increasing U.S. LNG exports
would help boost the U.S. economy while increasing global energy
security, and this legislation would bring certainty to DOEs export
approval process to ensure the U.S. does not miss this window of
opportunity.
