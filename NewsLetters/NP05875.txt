Harry Reid on Jobs: Nothing but Crickets
Dear Friends,
The gridlock the Senate is causing is simply unconscionable.
In addition to ignoring the package of energy bills we sent, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also refuses to consider
H.R. 4: the Jobs for America Act .
H.R. 4 is a jobs package that would: restrain the recent explosion of federal regulations; make permanent the ban on internet access taxes; restore the 40 hour work week that has been undermined by Obamacare; encourage the hiring of veterans; and repeal the medical device tax.
It would also require the Forest Service to actively manage for healthier forests and sustainable timber revenues for local communities, streamline the permitting process to expand Americas supply of rare earth minerals, and give small businesses much needed relief so they can hire more employees.
Harry Reid is desperately trying to sell the do nothing Congress as republicans' fault but it was his own decision to keep the Senate from coming to the table to work on these critical issues.
We have sent the Senate many different solutions and ideas.
Harry Reids Response? Still nothing but crickets.
Please let me know your
thoughts and concerns
on these or other issues.
