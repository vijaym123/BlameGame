Progress for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses in NH
Hi All!
I hope you all had a terrific weekend.
I spent last week pushing for
veteran-owned small businesses and fighting for Granite State workers.
At the Small Business Committee hearing
Advocating for Veteran-Owned Businesses
Last Wednesday, the U.S. House Small Business Committee approved an
amendment I introduced that would help increase job creation and
contracting opportunities for veteran-owned small businesses.
Our
nation's veterans made great sacrifices to protect our nation, and we
must ensure they have the resources they need when they return to
civilian life.
Many of our veterans are talented entrepreneurs, and my
amendment will help provide support and expanded contracting
opportunities for veteran small business owners.
My amendment would
require the U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary and the U.S. Small Business
Administration to regularly consult with veterans service organizations
on ways to increase opportunities and expand contracting programs for
service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and veteran-owned small
businesses.
I also voted in favor of additional amendments to increase contracting
opportunities for women-owned small businesses.
I was proud to support
my colleague Congresswoman Judy Chu's (CA-27) amendment to also help
women-owned small businesses succeed.
Congresswoman Chu's amendment
would increase the contracting goal for women-owned small businesses
from 5 to 6 percent.
Fighting for NH Workers
Last Thursday, I helped introduce the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act
of 2014, which would provide benefits and workforce training to
displaced New Hampshire workers whose jobs were affected by foreign
trade.
The bill would extend for an additional seven years key
provisions in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009 that lapsed
in December.
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which will
extend a key benefits program that many New Hampshire workers rely on.
This extension will restore access to TAA benefits to service industry
employees, which is particularly important to workers in New Hampshire's
North Country who have faced stiff foreign competition in the expanding
global marketplace.
I am hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can
work together in the House to swiftly pass this legislation, and
provide relief to these workers.
Last month, a Berlin, NH consulting firm, Salience Insight, let go of
half its workforce.
These workers may have been eligible for essential
benefits under the 2009 Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, but when the
bill expired last year, service workers were no longer included as a
category of workers for TAA benefits.
As a result, the Salience
Insight workers' application for benefits was denied.
This bill would
restore TAA benefits for service workers like those at Salience
Insight.
Working to Promote Energy Efficiency
On Wednesday, I voted in favor of H.R. 2126, the Energy Efficiency
Improvement Act, which would help commercial landlords and tenants work
together to lower energy consumption.
The bill would use a
market-driven, "best practices" approach to reduce demands on the
national energy grid.
Among other things, this bill would enable the U.S. Department of
Energy to develop a voluntary incentive program to reward and publicly
recognize tenants that design and construct highly energy-efficient
spaces. It would also help encourage public-private partnerships
between tenants who work for the federal government and private sector
building owners who are willing to invest in energy efficient building
practices.
Introduced by Representative David McKinley (WV-1) and
Peter Welch (VT-At Large), this bill is part of a larger bipartisan
effort to advance common sense energy efficiency initiatives in the
House of Representatives.
We must consider smart ways to reduce our energy consumption and take
advantage of alternative energy sources in order to cut costs for
taxpayers and protect our environment for generations to come.
I was
proud to join members of both parties in voting in favor of this common
sense energy efficiency legislation, and I look forward to the Senate's
swift passage of this measure.
At the 2014 Winter Challenge!
Skiing for a Great Cause
On Saturday, I was at Loon Mountain for the 2014 Winter Challenge,
sponsored by New England Disabled Sports.
This fantastic event raised
money for the New England Disabled Sports program, which is
headquartered at Loon and provides year round adaptive sport
instruction to adults and children with physical and cognitive
disabilities.
I was so inspired by the passion and spirit shown by
everyone who participated to support this important cause.
During the competition, Brad and I skied with Jerry Miserindino, a
disabled veteran who is now a ski instructor for NE Disabled sports.
Jerry is an accomplished skier with a positive outlook, who has
overcome many obstacles throughout his life.
It was great getting to
know him and spending some time together on the slopes!
Helping Granite Staters
In November, 2013, I was contacted by a New Hampshire veteran about the
significant difficulties she was facing in receiving her veterans
benefits.
Robin Partello served five years in the Air National Guard
and was on active duty between October 5, 2001 and September 30, 2003
in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Since April of last year she had tried unsuccessfully to obtain her
medical benefits.
She was repeatedly denied despite clearly qualifying
for coverage.
She even met with VA staff members who were concerned
but unable to help.
My office worked with the VA to get her evaluated
financially and medically and in December, she was approved and
obtained her benefits.
If my office may ever be of assistance with a
problem you are facing, please contact my staff at 603-226-1002 so we
may help you resolve your problem or get you the information you need.
Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Progress

NH
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
terrific
weekend.
I
spent
last
week
pushing
for
veteran-owned
small
businesses
and
fighting
for
Granite
State
workers.
At
the
Small
Business
Committee
hearing Advocating

Last
Wednesday,
the
U.S.
House
Small
Business
Committee
approved
an
amendment
I
introduced
that
would
help
increase
job
creation
and
contracting
opportunities
for
veteran-owned
small
businesses.
Our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
made
great
sacrifices
to
protect
our
nation,
and
we
must
ensure
they
have
the
resources
they
need
when
they
return
to
civilian
life.
Many
of
our
veterans
are
talented
entrepreneurs,
and
my
amendment
will
help
provide
support
and
expanded
contracting
opportunities
for
veteran
small
business
owners.
My
amendment
would
require
the
U.S.
Veterans
Affairs
Secretary
and
the
U.S.
Small
Business
Administration
to
regularly
consult
with
veterans
service
organizations
on
ways
to
increase
opportunities
and
expand
contracting
programs
for
service-disabled
veteran-owned
small
businesses
and
veteran-owned
small
businesses.
I
also
voted
in
favor
of
additional
amendments
to
increase
contracting
opportunities
for
women-owned
small
businesses.
I
was
proud
to
support
my
colleague
Congresswoman
Judy
Chu&#8217;s
(CA-27)

amendment
would
increase
the
contracting
goal
for
women-owned
small

from
5
to
6
percent.
Fighting
for
NH
Workers
Last
Thursday,
I
helped
introduce
the
Trade
Adjustment
Assistance
Act
of
2014 ,
which
would
provide
benefits
and
workforce
training
to
displaced
New
Hampshire
workers
whose
jobs
were
affected
by
foreign
trade.
The
bill
would
extend
for
an
additional
seven
years
key
provisions
in
the
Trade
Adjustment
Assistance
Act
of
2009
that
lapsed
in
December.
I
am
proud
to
be
an
original
cosponsor
of
this
legislation,
which
will
extend
a
key
benefits
program
that
many
New
Hampshire
workers
rely
on.
This
extension
will
restore
access
to
TAA
benefits
to
service
industry
employees,
which
is
particularly
important
to
workers
in
New
Hampshire&#8217;s
North
Country
who
have
faced
stiff
foreign
competition
in
the
expanding
global
marketplace.
I
am
hopeful
that
Republicans
and
Democrats
can
work
together
in
the
House
to
swiftly
pass
this
legislation,
and
provide
relief
to
these
workers.
Last
month,
a
Berlin,
NH
consulting
firm,
Salience
Insight,
let
go
of
half
its
workforce.
These
workers
may
have
been
eligible
for
essential
benefits
under
the
2009
Trade
Adjustment
Assistance
Act ,
but
when
the
bill
expired
last
year,
service
workers
were
no
longer
included
as
a
category
of
workers
for
TAA
benefits.
As
a
result,
the
Salience
Insight
workers&#8217;
application
for
benefits
was
denied.
This
bill
would
restore
TAA
benefits
for
service
workers
like
those
at
Salience
Insight.

On

I
voted
in

of
H.R.
2126,
the

to
develop
a
voluntary

It
would
also
help
encourage
public-private

between
tenants
who
work
for
the
federal
government
and
private
sector
building
owners
who
are
willing

I
was
proud
to

members
of
both
parties
in
voting
in
favor
of
this
common

energy
efficiency
legislation,
and
I
look

to
the
Senate&#8217;s
swift

of
this

Helping
Granite
Sta ters
In
November,
2013,
I
was
contacted
by
a
New
Hampshire
veteran
about
the
significant
difficulties
she
was
facing
in
receiving
her
veterans
benefits.
Robin
Partello
served
five

between
October
5,
2001
and
September
30,
2003
in
support
of
Operation
Enduring

and
Operation
Iraqi
Freedom.
Since
April
of
last
year
she
had
tried
unsuccessfully
to
obtain
her
medical
benefits.
She
was
repeatedly
denied
despite
clearly
qualifying
for
coverage.
She
even
met
with
VA
staff
members
who
were
concerned
but
unable
to
help.
My
office
worked
with
the
VA
to
get
her
evaluated
financially
and
medically
and
in
December,
she
was
approved
and
obtained
her
benefits.

my
