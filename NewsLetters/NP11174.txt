David --
Things are changing rapidly.
On Monday, I told you that Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s top deputy was being deployed to Illinois TODAY to fundraise for my opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling. Well, yesterday we found out that Mr. Schilling was added to the National Republican Congressional Committee&rsquo;s top contenders program.
That means the GOP establishment will give him extra special help
just to beat me.
We told you this race was going to be competitive, and that is shaping up to be an understatement. If we aren&rsquo;t able to hit our grassroots goal this month, we could fall dangerously behind.

Our campaign relies on grassroots donors. With the Tea Party and Boehner throwing everything they&rsquo;ve got to try and flip this seat, I&rsquo;m relying on you to step up.
I&rsquo;m so proud to represent Illinois in Congress. And I&rsquo;ll keep fighting for the folks I represent as long as I&rsquo;m in office.
Thanks for doing your part,
