Dear David,
I wanted to take a moment to give you a brief update on what I've been
up to these past few weeks.
But first, let me wish all fathers-
particularly my own dad, Len-a very happy Father's Day!
Between newsletters, don't forget to follow me on Twitter
or like my Facebook
page for daily updates!
As always, please do not
hesitate to contact me
if you have any questions or concerns, or simply want to
express your opinion.
I'm always happy to hear from you.
Sincerely,
>From the House Floor
The problems at the VA are unacceptable. President Obama has claimed
for years that fixing our broken VA is a priority, yet he's sat idly by
as its leadership and culture has continued to deteriorate. Our
veterans deserve better.
Recently, the House passed two bills that
would begin the process of fixing this broken agency:
H.R. 2072: Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act
This legislation requires the Obama administration to take additional
action if the VA has not appropriately responded to the recent
Inspector General report that recommended several actions the VA
Secretary must take to address the issues that have arisen at the
agency.
H.R. 4810: Veteran Access to Care Act
This legislation enables any veteran forced to wait more than 30 days
for an appointment at a VA facility the option to receive
private-sector care.
It also eliminates bonuses for any VA employee
until the agency improves its performance.

Committee Spotlight
This week, the Financial Services Committee
passed legislation to rein in the unaccountable
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and to make sure that the agency
is not above the law.
Transparency and accountability are hallmarks of
good government, and the bills we passed would subject the CFPB to the
routine checks that other federal agencies operate with, such as a
separate, independent Inspector General.
The committee also held a hearing examining our current coin production
and circulation practices and associated costs to the federal
government.
While confidence in U.S. currency is vitally important, we
must study new forms of payment, such as debit cards or mobile phones,
that will increasingly be used for commerce and explore how they will
impact future demand for banknotes and coins.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee
held a hearing to examine Iran's compliance with an
agreement signed in November requiring Tehran to give up part of the
country's nuclear program in exchange for the removal of economic
sanctions-a deal I felt was ill-fated and strongly opposed.
This
hearing sought to determine the standards and requirements that will be
used to verify Iran's compliance.
It also explored concerns with the
U.S. monitoring capabilities and the frequency of inspections by
international officials.
The Foreign Affairs Committee also recently held several subcommittee
hearings, including one examining the budget request and operations of
the State Department's Counterterrorism Bureau to ensure it is both
productive and cost effective.
Rep. Tom Cotton with students and parents from Greenbrier
Fighting Back Against Obamacare
Obamacare is riddled with hidden fees and taxes that President Obama
often conveniently forgets to mention whenever he talks about this
unworkable law.
Take the "health insurance provider annual fee," for
instance.
This "fee" is actually a new annual tax on health insurance
plans, which will ultimately mean higher premiums for both employers
and individuals.
That is why I have co-sponsored H.R. 3367,
legislation that would delay this tax until 2016 and provide a refund
to consumers who paid any amount toward the tax in 2014 or 2015.
Rest
assured, I will continue to fight to save Arkansans from the worst
effects of this terrible law until we can achieve full repeal.
Spotlight: Stopping the EPA's Assault on Arkansas's Energy
President Obama's EPA is one of the most aggressive history and
unfortunately, Arkansas is paying the price.
Recently, they announced
new power plant regulations that will have a devastating impact on
Arkansas's economy.
This regulatory assault on our energy industry
must be stopped.
That is why I sponsored H.R. 4813, the Protection and Accountability
Regulatory Act of 2014
, legislation that will terminate both last
year's New Source Performance Standard proposal and the most recent
proposal.
The bill will also prevent the EPA from issuing a
substantially similar rule for a period of 5 years after the bill is
enacted.
This week, I also joined my fellow members of the Arkansas
Congressional Delegation in sending a letter to Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy requesting the
agency hold a hearing in Arkansas to examine the impact of its recently
proposed carbon rule on the state, particularly the rural areas.
More
information and full text of the letter can be found here

Around Arkansas
I had a great afternoon in Hot Springs honoring this year's U.S.
Service Academy Attendees from Arkansas's 4th District at my annual
"Service Academy Send-Off" reception. The following students have
accepted appointments to one of the U.S. Service Academies:
Rep. Tom Cotton with Linette Westley, Jordan Elliot, and David Johnson,
3 of the 2014 U.S. Service Academy appointees from Arkansas's 4th
Congressional District
United States Military Academy
Jordan Elliot (Camden, Arkansas)
United States Naval Academy
David Johnson (Charleston, Arkansas)
Erika Hoffman (Sheridan, Arkansas)
Matthew Scoggins (White Hall, Arkansas)
United States Air Force Academy
Rebecca "Claire" Smith (Oden, Arkansas)
Linette Westley (Ashdown, Arkansas)
As a veteran, I feel strongly about the importance of military service.
I am proud of these young men and women for earning appointments to
these distinguished institutions.
And I want to extend my deepest
thanks to them for their willingness to respond to the call of service.
I know they will continue to make their communities and all of Arkansas
proud.

Protecting Religious Freedom
Meriam Ibrahim is the Sudanese woman who, along with her two small
children, has spent the last 5 months imprisoned in Khartoum on charges
of adultery and apostasy for her marriage to a non-Muslim man and
refusal to denounce Christianity.
She has been sentenced to death and
Sudanese authorities have shown no signs of releasing her.
Her
husband, a naturalized U.S. citizen has been repeatedly rebuffed in his
efforts to seek help from the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum.
The gross
mistreatment of Meriam Ibrahim by the Sudanese government is deplorable
and such religious oppression has no place in the modern world.
That's
why I introduced H.R. 4821, legislation that would grant Meriam Ibrahim
permanent legal status in the United States.
