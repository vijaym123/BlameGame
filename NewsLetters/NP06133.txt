Dear Friend,
The House of
Representatives has been busy over the last few days, and I want to make sure
you're up-to-date on what we've done.
I'll cover it in
two parts--this week's e-mail and next week's, so stay
tuned.
First on everyone's mind is how we're going to handle the
threat posed by the Islamic State. I've made no secret that I'm
skeptical of President Obama's "strategy," but I also believe this threat is
real and that it is my job to do everything I can to protect Americans
and make sure an attack doesn't happen here.
I discussed
this challenge for a pretty long segment Tuesday morning on C-SPAN's
Washington Journal. If you really want to know where I stand and how I
got there,
please give it
look :
I've said before that airstrikes alone won't eliminate this
danger.
That's why I've offered two bills to cut to the
core of how the Islamic State operates.
The first I told
you about last week, which is an
immediate suspension of the visa waiver
program.
The second is a powerful means to get
those who say they're with us in the Middle East to utilize all of their
resources to stop funding to the Islamic State. You can read more
about this idea
here .
These are times with very few clear-cut answers
and tough decisions. That's why I depend on hearing from you. Please
let me know
what
you think, and check your inbox again next week for an update on what
we've done to make life more affordable here at home.
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
