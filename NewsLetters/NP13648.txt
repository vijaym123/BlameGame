Dear Friend,
Last Friday morning, I joined Dr. Carl Cartwright, the Principal at Howard Middle School, for the schools musical drama presentation. The acting caliber and stage performance was very impressive and the performance was completely managed by the middle school students. I enjoyed talking to the students before and after the program, and was glad to answer their questions and congratulate them on their presentation. The faculty, teachers, and staff at Howard Middle School are doing a great job in guiding the success and achievement of these talented students.

Over the weekend, I had the pleasure of participating in four Christmas parades around the district. Several of my grandkids joined Sandy and I in my 97 Ford pick-up truck for the Ocoee Christmas Parade, and threw out candy as we wished the community a very happy Christmas season. When we passed the Lions Club building at the end of the parade route, I presented a flag that flew over the Capitol to Ocoee Lions Club members. The Lions Club has been very active in benefitting the community, and worked very hard to organize this weekends parade.
At the head of the Ocoee Christmas Parade was a local Ocoee resident, Mel Jenner, who flew 45 missions in the Army Air Corps during World War II. As we commemorated Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day on Saturday, it was very fitting to honor Chief Master Sergeant Jenner as a B-17 Flying Fortress tail gunner and recipient of many awards, including two Distinguished Flying Crosses. I thanked him for his dedicated service to our country.
In Winter Garden, I was the Grand Marshall for the Christmas parade, and was privileged to lead the route through the quaint downtown streets. Later on Saturday, I joined the Tavares Christmas Parade, and afterwards went up to Leesburg for their parade as well. It was great to see so many families and children enjoying the holiday season together and wish them Merry Christmas.

Recently, my interview from the Live with Lori: Political Food for Thought program aired on TV. During the program, I joined Lori Halbert in making stuffed chicken while we discussed a whole range of issues including my history in the state legislature, working on education in Florida, and my current involvement with the House Rules Committee in Washington. You can

Constituent Corner:
Last year, my office was able to assist a constituent in obtaining an expedited FBI background check in order to meet the mandatory deadline for her to continue teaching English overseas. This year, she contacted us again so that she could remain in South Korea teaching English for another year. Within a week after receiving her completed Privacy Form, my staff submitted the inquiry and received a call from the FBI saying that they had found and promptly processed her application.
Share Your View:
On June 14, 2013, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act that authorized appropriations for the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year 2014.
The legislation makes appropriations for weapons and equipment procurement, research and development, operation and maintenance, active and reserve military personnel, troop pay and health care, and many other vital accounts that keep the United States military the worlds finest fighting force.
The bill passed by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 315-108. Six months later, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has refused to even bring the bill up for a vote in the Senate. If the Defense Authorization is not passed by the end of the year, our troops will not receive the pay raise approved by the House earlier this year, and it will mark the first time in over 50 years that a defense bill was not passed.
Should Harry Reid and the Senate immediately take up the defense bill this week?
Yes
No
I don't know

Legislative Update:
With so many people traveling during this time of the year, many of them leave valuable items, including money and loose change, at our airport checkpoints. Last week, I supported the TSA Loose Change Act, a measure that directed the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to transfer this unclaimed money to nonprofit organizations that provide rest and recuperation facilities and amenities at our airports for members of the Armed Forces and their families. Currently, the TSA simply retains this money, which amounted to more than $500,000 over the past two years.
