As the son of a
Marine, I am deeply committed to working for our veterans and ensuring we
honor their service and
sacrifice.
Thats one of the reasons why I recently voted against the Ryan-Murray
budget proposal and its proposed cuts to our servicemen and women's
uniform retirement pay. The annual cut could have a devastating
financial impact for those who retire at the 20 year point by
reducing retired pay by nearly 20 percent before reaching age
62 .
While I commend Senator Patty
Murray (D-WA) and Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) for their work to
find agreement, I believe its simply unacceptable to pay for
Washingtons increased spending on the backs of our countrys veteransthe
brave and selfless men and women who have defended our nation--through
ill-conceived, blunt cuts to their retirement pay.
As your voice in Washington, it is not only my
priority, but also my job to represent and serve you. Please take a
moment to share your thoughts on this important issue by filling out the
