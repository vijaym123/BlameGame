Dear Friends,
This week, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Chairman Patty Murray unveiled a proposal which would give the United States its first operating budget in years.
The last shutdown cost our economy over $24 billion, and its a good sign to see Republicans and Democrats working together.
Im reviewing this proposal now in order to make the best decision for the folks in the 12th District.
Weve got some serious problems facing us - $17 trillion debts, wasteful spending, and a budget sequester thats hurting some folks in the 12th District.
Im not sure if this proposal is the direction we need to be going in, and Id like to get your feedback.
The Washington Post published some information on the bill that can be helpful as you make your decision on the proposal.

As always, if theres anything else I can do for you, please dont hesitate to ask.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
