Dear Friend,
The Koch brothers&rsquo; network of outside groups is planning an unprecedented assault before the 2016 elections, one that will cost them
$889 million. The ground is shifting beneath us when it comes to campaign finance.
When it comes to the damage
Citizens United
and subsequent Supreme Court decisions have done to our democracy, there&rsquo;s no telling how bad it will get.
But there&rsquo;s one thing that I can always depend on:
Your help to fight back.
Outside groups will spend millions of dollars to elect their anti-middle class allies. But grassroots networks like ours have always been -- and will always be -- a force that can overcome outside spending. Our deadline to reach $12,000 is only 2 days away. Help us have a successful May by contributing $5.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Until
Citizens United
is overturned, outside groups will continue their spending spree. Luckily, I have you to help fight against them.
Thank you for all of your help.
Ed
