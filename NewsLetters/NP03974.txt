Saving the Newport Coast Guard Helicopter
When Coast Guard officials recently threatened to close down Newport's
Coast Guard helicopter rescue station, endangering the lives of
commercial fishermen, recreational boaters and visitors along the
coast, Jeff got to work. After persuading the Coast Guard to extend the
closure date to December 15, Jeff worked with other members of the
Oregon delegation to let their colleagues know how important this issue
was to Oregon's coast and reverse the Coast Guard decision.
A few days
ago, they succeeded in passing a bill before the deadline to save the
helicopter and keep it in Newport.
As Jeff said, the passage of this bill is a literal lifesaver for our
coastal communities. It's a huge win for the safety of coastal
residents and visitors - and for the local economy, which is built on a
strong commercial and recreational fishing industry. Jeff is determined
to keep the Newport helicopter right where it belongs: in Newport.

will remain open until January 2016
Equality for All
In America, no one should be discriminated against just because of who
they are.
But today, it's still legal in dozens of states to discriminate against
lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) individuals in many
aspects of their lives. It's shocking that in the year 2014, Americans
could legally be denied a job, housing, or entrance to a store just
because of who they are or who they love. But in all too many places,
it's true.
That's why Jeff announced recently that he will be drafting a
comprehensive LGBT civil rights bill to give our LGBT friends and
neighbors the same civil rights protections that exist for other
Americans. As Speaker of the Oregon House, Jeff passed a comprehensive
LGBT civil rights bill to ensure that all Oregonians would have
equality under the law. Now, it's long past time to make sure that
equality is extended to all Americans.

Making the Senate Work Better for Working Families
Jeff has been fighting for years to break through the gridlock and fix
the broken Senate because he knows it's critical to making Washington
work for working Americans.
A year ago, Jeff's efforts led to a historic rule change - and it's
made a real difference. Recently, the Bend Bulletin highlighted Jeff's
work to make the Senate work better and the big impact the rule change
has had in its first year.

Happy Holidays!
This holiday season, Jeff is wishing safe and happy holidays to
everyone in Oregon.
Did you know that Oregon is one of America's top producers of Christmas
trees? To honor Oregon's tradition of growing great Christmas trees,
Jeff recently
encouraged
Forest Service officials to
bring an Oregon tree to the nation's capital as the Capitol Christmas
Tree in 2016.
Happy holidays!
