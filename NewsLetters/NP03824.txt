13th Congressional District E-Newsletter
Dear friends,
This week the state of Illinois suffered a great loss with the passing of Judy Baar Topinka.
Words cannot express how much Judy Baar Topinka meant to the entire state of Illinois, how much we will miss her, and how much we will miss her leadership. Her constant professionalism, passion for serving the people of Illinois, honesty, and sense of humor truly set her apart from all other elected officials. Judy was one of those legendary, all-time greats, and will be impossible to replace.
Shannon and I offer our deepest sympathies and will keep her family, friends and staff in our thoughts and prayers.
In Washington this week the 113th Congress adjourned for the last time. Once we return to Washington in January, it will be for the swearing in of the 114th Congress.
Before Congress adjourned, we approved legislation to fund the government for the next year, providing certainty for the American people and giving the next Congress an opportunity to operate without being forced to govern from crisis to crisis.
Although this was not a perfect bill, it does include many of the individual House-passed appropriation bills. But to return to regular order, where Congress debates each appropriation bill and goes line-by-line through the budget to see what works and what doesnt, we need a willing partner in the Senate.

As we head into the holiday season, my family and I would like to wish you a very Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a safe, prosperous New Year.

James R. Burgess Jr. Post Office Building
On Monday, the Senate approved legislation I introduced to designate the U.S. Postal Service facility at 302 East Green Street in Champaign, as the James R. Burgess Jr. Post Office Building.
Since Mr. Burgess passing in 1997, constituents in my district and especially his son, Steve, have been looking for a way to commemorate the achievements of his life. When I was first elected two years ago, Steve approached me, seeking my help to honor the life and legacy of his father. Its taken a lot of time and work and while Im proud that this bill is headed to the president's desk, I have a heavy heart. More than one year ago, Steve Burgess passed away suddenly. Steve worked tirelessly over the years to get this project to the finish line, and its heartbreaking that he wont be able to see it through to completion. Naming this building after Mr. James R. Burgess is both a small token of our gratitude for his service and an opportunity to honor his son, Steve.
The legislation now heads to the presidents desk to be signed into law.

Subcommittee Chairmanship
This week I named as the Chairman of the Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research Subcommittee for the 114th Congress.
I am
honored to be selected to chair this subcommittee
which considers legislation and matters vitally important to Illinois' agriculture industry. Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, and I look forward to this opportunity to highlight the important research done throughout the U.S. including research done right here in Illinois. Universities like the University of Illinois, Illinois State University and Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville in my district are at the forefront of cutting-edge research that has the potential to transform the future of agriculture.
