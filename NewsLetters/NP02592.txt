Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
Human Trafficking Roundtable Discussion
While I was in the district last week, I hosted a roundtable to discuss what can be done to combat human trafficking. I want to thank all the law enforcement and support service personnel who came and contributed to the conversation. We had a very productive discussion, and I'm grateful that we've got such talented individuals working everyday to protect the victims of human trafficking.

Introducing Legislation to Protect Local Radio
Tuesday, Congressman Gene Green and I introduced H. Con. Res. 17, The Local Radio Freedom Act. This legislation, which was cosponsored by an additional 92 Members of the House of Representatives, opposes attempts from record labels to impose new taxes on local radio stations.
Local radio stations provide invaluable news and emergency information, not to mention Friday night football scores and music. By demanding new performance taxes from local radio stations, big record labels are handed a payday while small radio stations are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. This legislation will ultimately protect the more than 244 million Americans who regularly tune in to their local radio station. I'd like to thank my colleague, Congressman Green, for introducing this legislation with me. I'm glad to see such wide bipartisan support to protect local radio.
Meeting with Commissioner Sid Miller
I had the pleasure of visiting the Texas Department of Agriculture to talk with Commissioner Sid Miller . We come across a lot of similar issues in our respective roles, so it was good to take some time to discuss some of those topics. I appreciate Sid's willingness to work with me to help Texas agriculture thrive!
Rotary Club Meeting in Granbury
I recently had the opportunity to speak with the Rotary Club in Granbury. The Rotary Club has chapters around the world full of business and community leaders, and Granbury is no different. We had a great conversation about what can be done to help our communities by leading with morality. I'm very thankful for the invitation to join the Granbury Rotary Club for their meeting.
Llano County Courthouse
The town of Llano has a wonderful town square, where the county courthouse sits. Originally built in 1892 by Jacob Larmour and A. O. Watson, the building has gone through several restorations to retain it's original appearance. The last restoration, which took place in 2002, was part of the Texas Historical Commission's Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program. The Llano County Courthouse is also on the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places. If you find yourself with a few minutes to spare in Llano, it's worth walking around to see this really neat, historic building.
