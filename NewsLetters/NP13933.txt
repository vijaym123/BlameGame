The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of November 25 - 29, 2013
As families and friends across the 32nd Congressional District join
together today, I am honored to highlight five academy graduates who
currently serve as officers in our military. Each of them has
selflessly sacrificed for the freedoms we enjoy as Americans and I'm
extremely thankful for their dedicated service to our great nation.
During this season of thanks, I believe it is extremely important to
remember our brave men and women in uniform and their families.
1st Lt. Megan Hoskins. USAF & Captain Jeffrey Randolph, Jr., USAF
Megan is a 2007 graduate of Hockaday School of Dallas and a 2011
graduate of the United States Air Force Academy. Most recently, she was
stationed in Korea at Osan AB as an Intelligence Officer working with
various high-altitude ISR platforms.
Megan was the Officer-In-Charge
of the Analysis side of the Tactics and Analysis shop in the 303rd
Intelligence Squadron.
Megan is currently in the United States at Holloman AFB, NM.
Over the
next year, she will be helping to stand up two F-16 squadrons that will
be moving from Luke AFB to Holloman.
Although this will be a big
change from working with ISR in Korea, Megan is excited for this
learning opportunity and is happy to be back in the States where she
can be close to her family.
Captain Jeffrey Randolph, Jr., USAF
Jeff is a 2005 graduate of St. Marks School of Dallas and a 2009
graduate of the United States Air Force Academy. Like his sister Megan,
Jeff has also spent time in Korea.
He is stationed at Kunsan AFB where
he flies the F-16.
He was promoted to Captain last May and is now
currently going through upgrade training to become a flight lead.
Jeff
has thoroughly enjoyed his time in Korea and will be looking forward to
moving on to his next assignment at the beginning of 2014 when he will
be stationed back in the States at Shaw AFB, NC.
1LT Matthew Hayden Meredith, USA
Hayden graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point
in May of 2010. After graduation, he was stationed at Ft. Benning,
Georgia, where he completed the Infantry Officer Basic Course, Airborne
School, Air Assault School, the infantry Mortar Leaders Course, and
where he earned his Ranger tab.
In September of 2011, he moved to Joint Base Lewis-McCord in Tacoma,
Washington, where he served as a Rifle Platoon Leader. In October of
2012, he deployed to Afghanistan. During his nine month deployment in
Panjwai District, Kandahar Province, Afghanistan he served as the
battalion liason officer to his brigade and then as the battalion
mortar platoon leader.
After returning from Afghanistan, Hayden works at Joint Base
Lewis-McCord where he is the Executive Officer of Able Company, 4th

demobilizing his unit as part of the overall army reduction effort.

team, on the Commandant's List, scored maximum PRT, and was the
recipient of 2006 USNA Lawrence Ethics Essay Award for Ethics and Moral
Reasoning for the Naval Leader.
