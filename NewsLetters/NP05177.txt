Rubio Announces Legislation To
Impose Temporary Visa Ban On Ebola
Affected Countries
On Monday, Marco announced plans to
introduce legislation to impose common
sense travel restrictions by creating a
temporary ban on new visas for nationals
of the countries of Liberia, Guinea and
Sierra Leone. Marco plans to introduce
the legislation following the
Senates return to session in
November.
The ban would be put in place
immediately, until the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) has certified that
the Ebola outbreak has been contained.
New countries in which the outbreak
reaches significant levels would also be
subject to this ban. The legislation
would exempt individuals who are approved
to come to the U.S. for training related
to the Ebola outbreak.
While Ebolas deadly
reach has proven to be a complex and
unique international challenge, the
many uncertainties surrounding this
virus continue to threaten U.S.
national security,
said Rubio . Our biggest
priority is ensuring that sufficient
safeguards are in place to limit the
spread of Ebola, contain it at the
source, and protect Americans.
We must take any and all
necessary precautions to contain this
virus
and common
senserestrictionson travel
from countries now confronting this
epidemic is an important step,
added Rubio . The most
effective way to combat this deadly
virus is to address it at its source.
This ban on issuance of visas does not
mean we will be completely cutting off
the affected countries from the outside
world. We must continue to increase our
assistance to those countries as they
struggle to contain this outbreak. That
is, ultimately, the only way we will be
able to stop this outbreak and keep
Americans safe from this horrible
disease.
Rubio To Kerry: Cuba Should Not Be
Allowed To Undermine Summit Of
Americas
Marco expressed concern over the
Administrations mixed messages to
the Panamanian government regarding
Cubas participation in the VII
Summit of the Americas to be held in
Panama.
In
a
letter to Secretary of State John
Kerry , Marco urged Kerry to stand by
the democratic principles the U.S.
formally committed to during the 2001
Summit in Quebec City, and argued that
the Castro regimes continued
oppression and habitual human rights
violations make Cuba ineligible to
participate.
Furthermore, allowing a
country that is a habitual violator of
human rights and has not allowed a free
election in over 50 years would damage
everything that the Summit wishes to
accomplish. Cuba should not be allowed
to undermine the commitment to
democracy made by the remaining nations
of the Western Hemisphere during the
Summit process, wrote Rubio.
Moreover, the United States
should not stand idly by if Panama does
indeed intend to invite Cuba to the
Summit.
I urge you to reaffirm the
United States position that Cuba
should only be welcome to participate
in the Summit when the Castro regime
abandons its repression of the
islands population and to ensure
that the nations of the Western
Hemisphere are left with no doubt that
the United States will stand firmly
behind the formal commitment it made at
the Quebec Summit, added
Rubio.
Rubio, Kirk: U.S. Support To Gaza
Cannot Come At Israels
Expense
Marco and Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL)
expressed concern over Secretary of State
John Kerrys recent announcement of
more than $150 million of assistance to
the United Nations Refugee and Works
Agency (UNRWA), despite ongoing concerns
about its conduct during the recent
conflict in Gaza.
In
a
letter to Kerry , the senators
highlighted three cases of rockets being
found at UNRWA facilities as well as the
absence of an independent investigation
into its actions, and called on the
Administration to assure Congress that
U.S. assistance to the Gaza
reconstruction effort will in no way aid
extremists attacks against
Israel.
Given UNRWAs record
and the absence of an independent
investigation into its actions during
the conflict, we were dumbfounded when,
on October 12th, you reiterated,
without any qualification, that the
United States would provide more than
$150 million to UNRWA programs in
Gaza,
wrote the senators . This
blind support sends the wrong message
to an institution that has already
become far too dependent on the
largesse of the American taxpayer and
repeatedly failed to ensure that its
facilities and resources are not used
by terrorists who wish to sow chaos and
instabilityrather than aid the
Palestinian people.
The United States should
assist the people of Gaza as they
rebuild after yet another Hamas-caused
conflict. But this support cannot come
at the expense of Israels
security,
added the senators . We
will not support the provision of
future U.S. assistance to entities or
projects in Gaza unless the State
Department assures Congress that UNRWA
or the relevant recipient entity has
imposed independently audited
accountability measures to verifiably
prevent any U.S. assistance from
aiding, directly or indirectly,
extremists efforts to rearm or
lay the groundwork for future attacks
against Israel.
Rubio Comments On Attacks In
Canada
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the recent attacks in
Canada:
Our neighbors to the north
have a long history of standing by
America in good times and bad. Canada
has been by Americas side in our
struggle against violent jihadists.
Since 9/11, Canadian servicemen and
women have shed blood in the fight
against Islamic extremism, and we stand
with them during this difficult period
and pledge our unwavering support as we
join them in mourning the fallen.
The attacks of recent days in
Canada as well as the horrible attack
on pedestrians, including Americans, on
a Jerusalem street yesterday are yet
another painful reminder that declaring
wars to be over does not end them.
Radical jihadists remain committed to
waging war against anyone who does not
share their warped ideology, which is
why we must defeat them wherever they
reside and work to reduce the risk of
self-radicalization of individuals in
our societies.
