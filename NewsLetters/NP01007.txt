Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
A Resolution Honoring Those Leading American Energy Revolution
Today, I introduced H.Res. 243, a resolution asking Congress to support the hard-working men and women who are leading the United States Energy revolution in West Texas. We have witnessed the impact of their strong entrepreneurial spirit and innovative technological advances that have grown our economy, created jobs, and bolstered our national security. We depend on their exhaustive and dangerous work to power our homes, pave our roads, fuel our cars, farm our lands and everything in between that keeps this nation running.
It is imperative that this Congress support energy policies that are as adaptive and innovative as these hard-working men and women. Our policies must cut through the bureaucratic red-tape to encourage exploration here at home, reduce job-killing regulations, and repeal the antiquated crude oil export ban of a bygone era.

Sitting Down with All Ag News
I really enjoyed sitting down with Tony St. James this week to talk about all things agriculture. Floydada, Texas is home to KFLP, the only all Ag, all-day radio station in Texas. Tony St. James is the owner and driving force behind KFLP. At one time he considered making it an all-comedy station, but he decided that all-ag was right for West Texas. Many farmers and ranchers spend hours listening to KFLP. KFLP Radio coverage stretches from Amarillo to Lamesa, and from Clovis to Vernon. I want to thank Tony for all he has done and continues to do for agriculture.
Brownwood Fire Station Dedication Ceremony
Tuesday morning, there was a dedication ceremony for the new Central Fire Station in Brownwood, Texas. The new fire station has been years in the making, and the dedication ceremony included presentations by the Heart of Texas Honor Guard, bagpipers and drums, and a flag-raising.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
