WEEK IN
REVIEW
This week was a busy one in Washington! I would like that
thank all of the Arkansans who were a part of it by visiting my
office during their visits to our nations capital, including Major Josh
Baker, the Arkansas Paper Recycling Coalition, Jennifer Necessary of
Rogers, the Arkansas Realtors, the
Rollene
family of Elm Springs, Arkansas Tech
students and faculty, the Cole family of Roland, the Arkansas Chapter of the
American Heart Association, Gene O'Nale of the Arkansas National
Guard, Arkansas State Representative Matt Pitsch,
Carlette
Metcalf of Springdale, the
Arkansas Pharmacists Association,
Arkansas Veterans Affairs
Assistant Secretary for Benefits Allison Hickey, Carolyn Philpot of Fort
Smith, Jeff Frisby of the Arkansas National Guard, the Arkansas Oil
Marketers Association, Paul Coates of Thornton, the Arkansas
Rheumatologists, and Anthony Sanders of the Arkansas National Guard. Safe travels
back to Arkansas!
On Tuesday afternoon,
Senator
Boozman, Senator Cotton, and I announced
that the Fort
Smith Regional Airport will receive nearly $592,000 in grant money from
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be used for firefighting
equipment. In an area with as much economic promise as Fort Smith, a
thriving regional airport is key, and I am proud to join with my
colleagues to celebrate this grant. It is yet another building block to
continued prosperity for Fort Smith.
Tuesday evening, the House passed two bills under
suspension
the Dont Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act ( H.R. 606 ;
Roll Call #216 ) and the
Defending Public Safety Employees Retirement Act ( H.R. 2146 ;
Roll Call #220 )
and the Regulatory
Integrity Protection Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1732 ) by a vote of 261-155 ( Roll Call #219 ). H.R. 1732 requires
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its Waters of
the U.S. proposal, which greatly expands the federal governments power
over waterways without stakeholder input.
On Wednesday, the
House passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 ( H.R. 2048 ) by a vote of 338-88 ( Roll Call #224 ). The bill
includes numerous reforms to the nations intelligence-gathering programs
operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by
building on legislation (H.R. 3361) passed in the 113th Congress to reform
surveillance authorities and strengthen privacy and civil liberties
protections. Ultimately, H.R. 2048 ensures that the U.S. Intelligence
community has the necessary tools it needs to protect our homeland from
an array of terrorist
threats,
while also increasing transparency and civil liberty
protections for Americans.
Additionally, the House passed
the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act ( H.R. 36 ) by a vote of 242-184 ( Roll Call #223 ). H.R. 36
generally prohibits the abortion of unborn children at 20 weeks after
fertilization or later with certain exceptions. Unborn lives matter,
and making sure our unborn that can feel pain are protected from
abortion is long overdue. As a cosponsor, I applaud the passage of H.R. 36,
which not only prohibits abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy
the point at which fetuses feel pain
but also provides compassionate
care for mothers coping with traumatic, stressful, and emotional
decisions about abortion. I will continue to support policies that protect
life and human dignity.
On Thursday, the House passed two bills under suspension
the
Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1191 ;
Roll Call #226 ) and the Hezbollah
International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 ( H.R. 2297 ;
Roll Call #227 ).
We wrapped up the week by passing the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for (FY) Fiscal Year 2016
( H.R. 1735 ) today
by a vote of 269-151 ( Roll Call
#239 ). The NDAA authorizes and prioritizes funding for
the Department of Defense (DoD) and other select national security
programs within the Department of Energy for FY 2016. Specifically, the
bill authorizes $515 billion in spending for national defense and an
additional $89.2 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund
(OCO), for a total of $604.2 billion, which is equal to the Presidents
overall budget request. Regardless of the gridlock in Washington and
our countless disagreements, there is one commitment that both sides of
the aisle must come together to uphold
our commitment to our men
and women in uniform. I commend Chairman Thornberry for his leadership
and on the passage of the fifty-fourth consecutive National Defense
Authorization Act and join my colleagues in sending the Senate a bill
that provides for our military in a way that is both fiscally responsible
and mindful of the growing threats across the globe. From ISIL to
Boko Haram, our enemies are becoming bolder and more numerous, but
defending our nation and defeating terrorist threats is one place where
politics should not
and cannot
interfere.
Next week, the House will be
back in session.
