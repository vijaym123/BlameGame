Video Address Text
Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address.
It is an honor to represent the
people of Virginias Fifth District,
and I appreciate the opportunity to share
with you some of what we have been working
on during the month of March.
Over the past month, my
colleagues in the House and I have focused
on reining in executive overreach, which
has become an issue of increasing concern
under the current Administration. I spoke
on the House floor in support of the
ENFORCE Act, which re-establishes the
checks and balances inherent in our
Constitution. This Administrations
record of overreach is so significant that
it has not only ignored and undermined
federal statutes, it has effectively made
law without congressional approval. By
passing the ENFORCE Act, we are working to
restore the proper role of the executive
and to ensure the laws Congress passes are
faithfully executed.
One such example of this
Administration failing to follow the
Constitution is with respect to the
individual mandate found in the
Presidents original healthcare law.
Earlier this month, the President announced
that the millions of Americans who had
their health plans cancelled because of the
law would be able to keep their plans and
be exempt from penalties until after the
2016 elections. This unilateral delay of
the harmful impacts of the law is further
proof that this law is having severe
repercussions for Americans and their
families.
To help working families and
small businesses, the House has passed two
bills to address the harm caused by the
Presidents healthcare law. The first
suspends the individual mandate tax penalty
under the Presidents healthcare law
for one year, and the second ensures
emergency service volunteers, such as
volunteer firefighters, are not considered
when determining full-time employees that
must be considered under the laws
employer mandate.
This month, we also continued our
focus on increasing access to capital for
small companies, allowing them to spur our
recovery and grow our economy. Along with
my colleague, Democratic Congresswoman
Terri Sewell, we introduced the Small
Company Disclosure Simplification Act. This
bipartisan legislation would streamline
regulations for small public companies and
remove disincentives for companies to
access capital in the public markets. It
would allow companies to focus on
innovating, expanding, and creating jobs,
rather than complying with duplicative and
unnecessary federal regulations. I am
pleased to report that our bill passed the
Financial Services Committee with
overwhelming bipartisan support, and now
awaits a vote on the House Floor.
This month, I also had the
opportunity to travel throughout our
district to meet with our constituents. I
attended the Boy Scouts Merit Badge
College in Rustburg and spoke with students
at Fluvanna High School in Palmyra and
Baker-Butler Elementary School in Albemarle
County. I also engaged with local elected
officials throughout Central and Southside
Virginia who share the responsibility in
representing the two cities, 21 counties,
and 39 towns that make up Virginias
Fifth District. It is an honor to work
alongside these state Senators, Delegates,
members of Boards of Supervisors, City and
Town Council members, School Board members,
and Constitutional Officers to serve the
fine people we represent.
I am grateful for the opportunity
to represent you in Washington, and I look
forward to continuing to work to promote
policies that will grow our economy, create
jobs, and provide for a brighter future for
our nation.
As we close, I encourage you to
sign up for frequent updates at our website
at
hurt.house.gov
and join the conversation on our social
media pages. Thank you for tuning in to our
monthly video address.
Robert visited with Dr. Robert Craig
Group, a physics professor at the
University of Virginia and his colleague,
Adam Davis.
Robert met with Candy Daffern and
Barbara Miller of the Monticello Area
Community Action Agency.
Sincerely,
Washington, DC
