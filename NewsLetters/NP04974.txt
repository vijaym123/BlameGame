Friend -- With only five days left until the election, TWELVE Senate races are still polling within three points -- which Nate Silver calls &ldquo;remarkable&rdquo;!
&ldquo;Republicans... haven&rsquo;t been able to put Democrats away,&rdquo; Silver continues. Our amazing grassroots -- you -- have brought us so close to victory. And now we have to finish strong.
In 24 hours, we&rsquo;re launching the Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push that will WIN us this election.
We have an AGGRESSIVE plan to reach out to 3.5 MILLION voters!
But it could all fall apart if we can&rsquo;t raise the last $1,434,634 -- and we could lose the entire election at the last second.
Will you pitch in before tomorrow&rsquo;s end-of-month deadline so we can INVADE battleground states, PUSH voters to the polls, and CLINCH the Senate for Democrats? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Depending on how many voters we can reach this weekend, Mitch McConnell could be GONE in five days. The GOP&rsquo;s hopes could be OBLITERATED.
But Senator Al Franken warned earlier today: &ldquo;With just days to go until the polls close, every minute counts.&rdquo; Every minute you wait to give is another voter we could be contacting -- so please, don&rsquo;t delay a second longer.
Pitch in NOW and we&rsquo;ll use your donation to get to critical voters in critical states. AND, it&rsquo;ll be triple-matched -- giving it four times the effect!!
