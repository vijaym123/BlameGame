News from Representative John Delaney
March 14, 2014
Dear Friend,
I write to you today to share some exciting news on my work to
strengthen job growth in the United States. This morning, the House
Committee on Financial Services considered legislation I introduced
with Representative Stephen Fincher (TN-8) to streamline the initial
public offering (IPO) process for growing American businesses. I was
happy to see strong bipartisan support for my bill, which passed the
Committee in a 56 to 0 vote.

at the Financial Services Hearing
Having worked for two decades as an entrepreneur and CEO, I understand
that when more companies go public, our economy grows and employers
hire more people. According to a study published by Forbes, after going
public, the average company adds 822 employees. With more than two
million people looking for work nationwide, these are jobs that our
workforce needs now. Having taken two companies public myself, I
understand that a simpler IPO process will help provide American
businesses with the resources they need to grow and to realize their
potential.
That's why I partnered with Representative Fincher to introduce the
Improving Access to Capital for Emerging Growth Companies Act, H.R.
3623. This legislation would streamline the IPO process for Emerging
Growth Companies (EGCs), making it easier for them to attract investors
and conduct road shows, and simplifying the IPO registration process.
H.R. 3623 also clarifies the definition of an EGC, ensuring that all
eligible companies are able to take advantage of the streamlined
process.
As the 113th Congress moves forward, I will be sure to keep you
up-to-date with my work to strengthen job growth in the United States.
While H.R. 3623 takes an important step forward in addressing some of
challenges that employers face today, we still have a long way to go to
ensure that all Americans have the opportunities they deserve in today's
economy. I welcome your feedback on this important issue and my work in
Congress.
Sincerely,
John

Dear

I
write
to
you
today
to

on
my
work
to
strengthen
job
growth
in
the
United

This

the
House

I
introduced

Having

for
two

as
an

I

that
when
more
companies
go

our
economy
grows
and
employers
hire
more

According
to
a
study
published
by
Forbes,
after
going

the
average

adds
822
employees.
With
more
than
two
million
people
looking
for
work
nationwide,
these
are
jobs
that
our
workforce
needs
now.
Having
taken
two

myself,
I
understand
that
a

will
help
provide
American
