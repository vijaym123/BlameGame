Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
On Friday night, it was a pleasure to join family members, friends, and South Lake High School administration and faculty in honoring hundreds of graduates for their hard work and time they have invested in attaining a high school diploma.
Graduation is a time to recognize accomplishments as well as a commencement to begin the next chapter of life. I wish these graduates great success as they pursue their dreams and inspire those around them.

This past weekend, I participated in a West Orange Habitat for Humanity Groundbreaking Ceremony in Winter Garden. It was a pleasure to join St. Lukes United Methodist Church in preparing to welcome the Fikes family into the Habitat community. Pamela Fikes and her daughter, Shayla, both work for Orange County Public Schools and have lived in East Winter Garden their entire lives. Pamelas granddaughter, Taylor, is an honor roll student at Tildenville Elementary. West Orange Habitat for Humanity is having an impact on the lives and future of many.

Last week, representatives from the Florida Chamber of Commerce came to my office in Washington to discuss trade and transportation legislation. Jobs and the economy are the biggest issues impacting Floridas families and individuals, and I was eager to hear an update from the Florida Chamber and discuss ways we can continue to encourage job creation in Central Florida and spur entrepreneurial success.

While I was in Washington, I had the privilege of welcoming several constituents visiting our nations capital, including April Lopez and the Central Florida running group that accompanied her. My staff provided April and her friends with a tour of the Capitol building and assisted in making their trip a memorable experience.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Groveland contacted my office regarding an problem receiving durable medical equipment from Medicare. Due to lung problems, he required the use of compressed oxygen to live and work. For the past several years, he received three large oxygen tanks every other week, but was informed that because of the Affordable Care Act, the three would be reduced to one. Our office contacted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on his behalf.
Shortly after submitting an inquiry, the constituent contacted my office to express his thanks for our assistance and to let us know that his regular oxygen supply had been restored.

Response from the
previous survey question,
"With growing evidence that the VA scandal, which has contributed directly to the death of dozens of veterans, has been ongoing for months if not years, do you believe the President of the United States is doing enough to hold VA personnel responsible for these deaths?" Yes - 14%
No - 80%
I don't know - 6%
Legislative Update:
As details of the secret wait lists at veterans hospitals were revealed in a report this week, the passage last week of a bill that I cosponsored became even more timely. H.R. 4031, the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan support of 390-33, provides the authority to the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to remove any senior executive who has been negligent in carrying out their duties.
As the depth of the scandal at the VA that has led to the untimely deaths of dozens of veterans continues to grow, it is unconscionable and completely unacceptable that the brave men and women who have put on a uniform and so faithfully served our country would be denied the timely, critical care and services we have promised to provide.
On Friday, following the resignation of Secretary of the Department of Veteran Affairs Eric Shinseki, I sent a letter to newly Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson asking him to expand access to medical care for our veterans by allowing those veterans who are experiencing delays to use private-sector medical providers at the VAs expense. We must ensure that we use all the tools at our disposal to deliver delayed care to our veterans.
Veterans deserve our deepest respect, and it is intolerable that the personnel overseeing this charge would be so irresponsible and unsympathetic. It is similarly intolerable that these bad actors cannot be held accountable due to the constraints of current law. This bill relieves the Secretary of those constraints, and the Senate should not delay in sending it to the President for his signature.
Secretary Shinsekis resignation and this bill alone will not solve the systemic failures the Inspector General found at VA health facilities around the country.
The House will continue to seek answers to the many troubling questions this scandal has raised and work with the President and any Members from either side of the aisle or the Capitol who are willing to right these terrible wrongs and get the VA back on the right path. This week, I plan to personally visit the VA facilities in Central Florida.
