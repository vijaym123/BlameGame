Friends,
The
world lost a fearless leader and champion of Democracy last week,
Nelson Mandela.
Wrenzie and I offer our prayers and deepest
condolences to the Mandela family and the people of South Africa as they mourn
the loss of this great leader.
In the words of Nelson Mandela,
When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and
his country, he can rest in
peace.
2013 Farm Bureau Annual Dinner
Our Farmers are
vital to the Seventh Districts economy, and I enjoyed attending the
Farm Bureaus Annual Dinner last Thursday. As the House and Senate are
set to conference on their respective Farm Bills, it was great to
speak with our communitys farmers and hear their thoughts about the
negotiation process. I am not on the Farm Bill Conference Committee, but I
will do what I can to support the needs of our farming
industry.

Analyzing Post-Recession Small Business
Lending
The House Small Business Subcommittee that I preside over held a
hearing last week to examine the current state of lending for small
businesses and their access to functional capital.
We were fortunate
to have the SC Bankers Association President, Fred Green, attend the
hearing and testify about the small business lending market in South
Carolina.
The hearing provided a
great dialogue about the various factors and economic trends affecting
levels of lending to small businesses.
The fact of the matter is
that small businesses cannot expand and create jobs if they do not have
access to working credit.
Some of the reasons for this limited
access are market demand and fluctuating credit levels.
However,
Washingtons increased regulatory scrutiny is also proving to be a
major factor to dwindling access to
credit.
Thankfully, new lending alternatives have become available for small
businesses.
However, as our nation attempts to fully rebound
from the recession and improve our global economic competitiveness,
Washington must pull back on the onslaught of financial regulations so that
small businesses can access the credit they need to grow and create
jobs.

A Date Which Will Live In
Infamy
Yesterday, Americans and veterans around the World remembered the brutal
attack on Pearl Harbor.
On December 7, 1941, Japanese aircraft
engaged in a sneak-attack on our military.
In just two hours, more
than 2,400 Americans lost their lives and more than 1,000 were left
wounded.
This attack shook America to the core and launched our
Nation into war. We will never forget the sacrifices our veterans and
their families have made; and as we enter the holiday season, I
encourage you to keep our deployed troops and their families in your thoughts
and prayers.
Have a good
week,
Washington D.C.
