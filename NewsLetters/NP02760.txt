LEGISLATION
February 15, 2015
Dear
David,
This past week, President Obama asked Congress for formal
authorization for the use of military force against the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In
his letter (please
read here)
and
draft resolution (please read
here) , the President outlines his requests, specifically for the ability
to continue air strikes and authorize "ground combat operations in
limited circumstances," including rescue operations and special forces
operations to "take military action against ISIL leadership." The
authorization would expire three years from now.
Do you believe Congress should approve the Presidents
request? Yes. No. Congress should approve air
strikes, but not ground troops.
