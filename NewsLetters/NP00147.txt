Friend,
Father&rsquo;s Day is just a couple days away and I have been thinking a lot about what a privilege it is to be a father.
More than anything, I want to be able to be there for my family when they need me and I know most fathers would echo the same sentiment.
But too often, other obligations take us away from our families. The lack of parental leave and affordable childcare policies force us to make hard decisions between fulfilling our commitments at work and our commitments to our family.
No parent should have to choose between working to put food on the table and caring for a new or sick child.
There is nothing more important than family and we need to ensure parents have the ability to care for their families in times of need.

The relationship between parents and their families should never suffer because of work, which is why parental leave and childcare policies are so important.
Family should always come first--

Be well,
