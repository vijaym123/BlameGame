Dear friend:
Today at 7pm, I'm hosting an
interactive webinar on how to effectively apply and compete for
federal jobs . This is part of my ongoing efforts to bring everyone in
our community back to work.
The webinar, which will be
presented by Dolores Garcia, US Department of Labor Recruitment Coordinator
for the Boston and New York Regions, will cover:
How
to read a vacancy announcement and how the applicant can set
themselves up for success
Who gets referred to the selecting
official and why
The importance of competency
questions
How, if you follow the rules taught in resume writing
workshops, you will probably fail to be sent to the selecting official for a
federal job
The importance of reading the vacancy
announcement from top to bottom as it is the little things that will kill your
chances
Ways to get into the federal gov't (the applicant
should know of the numerous ways to be considered for a
position)
The Pathways Program
for students and recent
grads
The Bender List
What it is and how to get on it
for
individuals with disabilities
Non-competitive hiring authorities
(for certain veterans, individuals with disabilities and current and
former Peace Corps volunteers, 30% and greater disabled
veterans.)
There will also be time at the end of the webinar for
questions and answers.
