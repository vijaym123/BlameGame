Dear Friends,
Today we recognize one of the most sacred American holidays - a day
dedicated to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for the freedoms we
enjoy to this day. You and I are able to live our lives freely because
of these brave men and women, and for that we will remain forever
grateful.
Just last week I was able to experience Memorial Day early, visiting
with men and women in uniform - many of whom were from South Carolina -
in Kabul, Afghanistan. During my time with them I let them know the
folks from the 3rd District stand behind their mission and are praying
for their safe return. I hope you will take some time today to honor
the fallen and participate in a Memorial Day service.
One way we honor the memory of the veterans who are no longer with us
is to make sure their surviving brothers and sisters-in-arms are
treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. With all the
controversies surrounding the current Department of Veterans Affairs
today, we are reminded we still have a long way to go to ensure those
who sacrifice on our behalf are adequately treated and compensated. I
promise to continue fighting to hold the VA accountable and ensure our
veterans receive the benefits the were promised and deserve. I've heard
from many veterans over the past week who have shared their
frustrations with me and are disgusted with the "lack of urgency"
coming from some leaders in Washington on this issue. Veterans deserve
accountability, justice, and a solution, and it needs to happen
immediately.
Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to join me
tomorrow for my 2nd Annual First Responders Tour. The purpose of this
event is to invite the public out to honor and thank our local first
responders (many of which are veterans themselves), and to pay homage
to the sacrifices they make for our safety. I encourage everyone to
come out and support them by attending one of these events.
Blessing and Liberty,

Dear
Friends,
Today
we
recognize
one
of
the
most
sacred
American
holidays
&#8211;
a
day
dedicated
to
those
who
paid
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for
the
freedoms
we
enjoy
to
this
day.
You
and
I
are
able
to
live
our
lives
freely
because
of
these
brave
men
and
women,
and
for
that
we
will
remain
forever
grateful.
Just
last
week
I
was
able
to
experience
Memorial
Day
early,
visiting
with
men
and
women
in
uniform
&#8211;
many
of
whom
were
from
South
Carolina
&#8211;
in
Kabul,
Afghanistan.
During
my
time
with
them
I
let
them
know
the
folks
from
the
3rd
District
stand
behind
their
mission
and
are
praying
for
their
safe
return.
I
hope
you
will
take
some
time
today
to
honor
the
fallen
and
participate
in
a
Memorial
Day
service.
One
way
we
honor
the
memory
of
the
veterans
who
are
no
longer
with
us
is
to
make
sure
their
surviving
brothers
and
sisters-in-arms
are
treated
with
the
dignity
and
respect
they
deserve.
With
all
the
controversies
surrounding
the
current
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
today,
we
are
reminded
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
ensure
those
who
sacrifice
on
our
behalf
are
adequately
treated
and
compensated.
I
promise
to
continue
fighting
to
hold
the
VA
accountable
and
ensure
our
veterans
receive
the
benefits
the
were
promised
and
deserve.
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
veterans
over
the
past
week
who
have
shared
their
frustrations
with
me
and
are
disgusted
with
the
&#8220;lack
of
urgency&#8221;
coming
from
some
leaders
in
Washington
on
this
issue.
Veterans
deserve
accountability,
justice,
and
a
solution,
and
it
needs
to
happen
immediately.
Lastly,
I
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
invite
you
to
join
me
tomorrow
for
my
2nd
Annual
First
Responders
Tour.
The
purpose
of
this
event
is
to
invite
the
public
out
to
honor
and
thank
our
local
first

(many
of
which
are
veterans
themselves),
and
to
pay
homage
to
the
sacrifices
they
make
for
our
safety.
I
encourage
everyone
to
come
out
and
support
them
by
attending
one
of
these
events.
