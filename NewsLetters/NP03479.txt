Helping Our Veterans Find Jobs, Ros-Lehtinen
Supports The Hire More Heroes Act
Hiring veterans
should be of paramount importance for our nations businesses. Their
professionalism and determination mark their service to our country and
are qualities that help any enterprise succeed. Our veterans have
sacrificed so much for our nation, it is only fitting that we do all we
can to help ensure they are able to earn a living when they return
home.

Ros-Lehtinen Re-Introduces Bill To Relist North Korea As A
State Sponsor Of Terrorism
From kidnapping U.S.
citizens, to repeated missile launches, sinking a South Korean naval
vessel, an appalling human rights record, and to the recent cyber attacks,
it is clear that the North Koreans feel emboldened and the U.S. must
respond with enforcing and applying stricter sanctions. For our own
national security, as well as that of our allies, especially those in the
region like South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, we cannot allow North
Korea to continue sponsoring terror without
consequences.

On House Floor, Ros-Lehtinen
Opposes Policy Concessions Toward Cuban Communist
Regime
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose the December 17th
announcement by the President on policy changes towards the Cuban

using Alan Gross as a pawn to receive concessions from the
administration and their strategy worked.
In April 2013, when asked

Congress that we have refused to do that because there is no
equivalency. Alan Gross is wrongly imprisoned. And we are not going to trade as
if it is a spy for a spy
That turned out to be not
true.

All U.S. Funds To The Palestinian Authority Must Be Immediately
Suspended After The PA Signs Rome Treaty, Says
Ros-Lehtinen
The latest destructive actions by Abu Mazen and the
Palestinian Authority reaffirms, once again, that Abu Mazen is not a real
partner for peace. By attempting to bring a flawed resolution to the UN
Security Council and by signing the Rome Treaty, Abu Mazen only
reiterates that he is not willing to return to direct peace negotiations with
Israel without pre-conditions...

Paris Attack Rekindles
Debate Over Freedom Of Expression
Artists and
journalists should push the envelop. Everything is on the table
religion included, said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., the chairwoman
of the House Foreign Affairs panel on the Middle East. Why shouldn't
religion be the subject of merriment and ridicule? We all are. That's
freedom. If you're just going to be free to do what is accepted,
that's not freedom.
