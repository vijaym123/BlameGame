Rep. Tsongas with
recent nominees to the U.S. service
academies
Dear Friend,
As
families and high school students begin to make post-graduation plans,
it is important for them to have accurate information and the ability
to ask questions as they weigh different opportunities. That is why
this Thursday, October 30 th , I will host the Third Districts
7 th
Annual U.S. Service Academy and Military Career Forum
at Lowell High school.
The event will highlight
opportunities to attend the United States Service Academies, participate in local
University ROTC programs, and serve in each of the armed services.
Students and their families will be able to interact with
representatives of each of these organizations and to explore the array of benefits
military service can provide.
More information is also
available at

Each year I have the privilege of nominating a

to our nations service academies. This annual event provides high
school students and their families with information about that process and
other opportunities to serve their community and country through
military service.
