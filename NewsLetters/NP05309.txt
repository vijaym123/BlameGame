Hi David,
I&rsquo;m Tracy Mayfield, finance director for Brad Schneider&rsquo;s re-elect.
For 2013-2014, we do not have a record of your support. I believe that should be correct, but I ran this search by E-mail. (If it&rsquo;s not or you have questions, just reply to this message.) Brad is incredibly thankful for his grassroots support.
Most polls show us tied or even ahead by a few points.
I&rsquo;m reaching out tonight because there&rsquo;s only 19 days to go and over $6.5 million being spent against Brad on Illinois t.v. Would you consider contributing $5 to help Brad finish strong?
You may contribute on our website ( act.schneiderforcongress.com/donate-here ) or call us at 847-790-4333 to send a donation by phone.
Gifts of any amount are greatly appreciated.
Thank you again,
Tracy Mayfield
