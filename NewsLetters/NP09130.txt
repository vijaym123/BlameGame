Palazzo Hosts Air Force Secretary James at Keesler
Palazzo Calls for Shinseki to 'Clean House' at VA or Resign
Palazzo Bill Could Expand Red Snapper Season
Pro-life Groups Praise Palazzo Bill to Protect Disabled Children
Friends-
I am saddened and angered, but not surprised, by recent reports of negligence and failures at the Department of Veterans Affairs. After learning of deaths at the Jackson VA last year, I suspected these problems were widespread throughout the VA system.
Secretary Shinseki has heeded our
calls to step down . Leaders at the Phoenix VA are being fired. The internal investigation continues. The House has
taken action
to expedite termination for more high-level VA officials. The VA has become the poster-child for dysfunctional government bureaucracy.
This isn't over . Secretary Shinsekis resignation should be the first step the VA takes, but certainly
not the last . We must continue to clean house at the VA and clear the way for substantial, institutional reforms. We must continue to demand better for our veterans.
I
have
also had concerns about the care given to veterans locally, and I've asked the
Jackson and Biloxi VA facilities
to account for wait times.
I will continue to keep close contact with those taking care of our South Mississippi veterans.
As always, I'm here to assist those who have problems working with the VA or
any
government agency. You can reach my offices by calling toll-free:
1-855-255-8740.
I also encourage you to connect with me on
facebook ,
twitter , or by visiting my
website .
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
