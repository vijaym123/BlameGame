David, Early this morning, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling launched a desperate and dishonest smear campaign.
Mr. Schilling knows our race is neck-and-neck. It&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;ll say anything to pull ahead.
David, if we don&rsquo;t respond
-- immediately --
Illinois voters could believe his lies.
Please, will you chip in to our Illinois Rapid Response Fund to help us fight back?
I could really use your help. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Mr. Schilling&rsquo;s trying to distract voters from his anti-middle class record by pointing to veterans &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; that never happened.
Let me be clear, David: I&rsquo;ve always fought for our veterans. And I always will. Please, don&rsquo;t these attacks go unanswered. Chip in tonight: http://action.cheribustos.com/Fight-Back
