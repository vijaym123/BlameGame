Friends,
Congress recently wrapped up
Stop Government Abuse Week
and I believe we landed some solid counterpunches against government overreach.
The U.S. House passed
fourteen bills
to empower American families and businesses. This stands in stark contrast to President Obamas hunger for more executive power and control (what he refers to as his pen and phone).
The first group of bills focused on transparency. We voted to
shine light in the dark corners of the federal government
by creating an online program for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests (H.R 1211). Using this system, citizens would be able to easily request access to hidden government information and receive a more timely response.
Other measures that passed would make it
easier for taxpayers to understand how their money is used
by the federal government. This would be accomplished, in part, by forcing every agency to submit an annual report card detailing their expenditures and operating costs (H.R. 1423). Meanwhile, the executive branch would be required to put a disclaimer on any taxpayer-funded public communication (H.R. 3308).
Three bills were aimed at
protecting taxpayers from the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). One would prevent proposed new rules to further hassle and target civic groups for their political beliefs (H.R. 3865). We also sought to protect all taxpayers by prohibiting the IRS from asking about your religious beliefs, limiting the amount of time you can be subjected to an audit, and forcing the IRS to disclose when it shares your tax information with another federal agency (H.R. 2531, H.R. 2530).
We took steps to
c ontain the growing federal regulatory burden , which costs America an estimated $1.8 trillion annually. Under our plan, if the government proposes a new regulation, it must publish online notices every month with information about the plans and associated costs (H.R. 2804). Additionally, agencies would be required to use the least costly method of implementing new rules that affect families and small businesses (H.R. 2122, H.R. 2542). This matters because costly regulations drive up prices, drive down wages, and drive out jobs.
Another outstanding bill that passed would
protect private property rights
by blocking certain federal funds to states and localities that abuse eminent domain powers (H.R. 1944).
We also acted to
eliminate the law that prevents you from unlocking your own cell phone . This would make it easier for you to switch to a new wireless provider without being forced to buy a new phone (H.R. 1123).
Now, you might reasonably think this legislation will get trapped by Washington gridlock, but heres some good news: several of the bills Ive outlined passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The online program for FOIA requests passed unanimously.
So, I believe we made some progress in taking power away from Washington and transferring it back to you, the American people. We must continue working vigilantly to
confront government overreach wherever it exists .
