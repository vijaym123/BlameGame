Friends,
Another week, another ObamaCare delay
. This
time the Obama administration pushed back the March 31 open enrollment
deadline despite repeatedly telling Congress and the American public
the deadline was "firm"
and that they
lacked the statutory authority to change it
.
Two weeks ago, I sat in an appropriations committee hearing when Health
and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said point blank that
the deadline was firm and would not be changed. Check out the exchange
between Secretary Sebelius and one of my colleagues, Representative
Chuck Fleischmann from Tennessee:
We all want as many Americans as possible to have affordable health
insurance, but the deadline is there for a reason. Removing it brings
more uncertainty into the marketplace and makes it difficult for
providers to distill metrics and set future rates.
This latest delay serves to hide the reality that ObamaCare is
fundamentally flawed and cannot be fixed through small tweaks or
executive orders. That is why we need to scrap it and replace it with
patient-centered reforms that actually lower costs and improve care.
However, I do not believe it is enough to just say we want to repeal
ObamaCare. We must come behind it with a plan that makes sense and
actually works. A group of conservative lawmakers - several who are
doctors - is working on this right now. I will keep you updated as the
specifics take shape over the next few months.
Unions Interfering with the Workplace?
Did you know that union officials are reportedly accompanying federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspectors
during visits to non-unionized
businesses? This certainly raised a red flag with me. If workers wish
to unionize, they have a right to. They also have a right not to be
coerced into unionizing, which is why OSHA inspectors teaming up with
labor reps at private, non-union businesses is alarming.
This development is especially concerning considering recent efforts by
southeastern automotive manufacturing businesses to resist
unionization, most recently in February at the Volkswagen assembly
plant in Chattanooga. There is no doubt that the southeastern
manufacturing industry is thriving in part due to the pro-business
environment, right-to-work laws, and skilled workforce found in our
region.
Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez is scheduled to testify
before
the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations
Subcommittee this week. I look forward to discussing these issues with
him. I'll let you know what develops.
Seeking Solutions for Our Veterans
On Thursday, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki appeared
before the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies
Appropriations, of which I am a member. I used the hearing as an
opportunity
to ask Secretary Shinseki about an
effective, efficient service known as the Patient Centered Community
Care program, or PC-3.
The program would allow veterans to seek treatment in certain instances
from local providers rather than solely at VA facilities. This is
especially important when certain ailments would require a veteran to
travel hundreds of miles to a VA facility with the appropriate medical
care. It could cut down on travel inconveniences, costs to the federal
government, and wait times associated with VA facilities. PC-3 is
especially important for rural areas, like Southeast Alabama.
I will continue to work with the VA to ensure that PC-3 is fully
implemented and all VA officials are actively promoting the
commonsense, cost-saving solution.
The Week Ahead
We will have another packed schedule in Washington next week with a lot
of the focus on the federal budget process. Additionally, we will
continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine.
Specifically, the House is expected to consider:
*	H.R. 4005
: the
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014, which would
authorize funding for the coast guard;
*	S. 2183
: United States
International Programming to Ukraine, which would authorize Voice of
America broadcasts in Ukraine;
*	H.R. 2575
: the Save American
Workers Act, which protects Americans and their wages from ObamaCare's
dangerous 30 hour rule; and
*	H.R. 1874
: the
Pro-Growth Budgeting Act, which requires the Congressional Budget
Office to provide detailed information on the economic impact of major
legislation.
As always, do not hesitate to contact my office
directly if we can be of assistance to you. My staff
and I are here to help.

Friends,
Another

another

Seeking
Solutions
for
Our
Veterans
On
Thursday,
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
Eric
Shinseki
appeared
before
the
Military
Construction,
Veterans
Affairs
and
Related
Agencies
Appropriations,
of
which
I
am
a

I
used
the

as
an

to
ask
Secretary
Shinseki
about
an
effective,
efficient

known
as
the
Patient

or
PC-3.
The
program
would
allow
veterans
to
seek
treatment
in
certain
instances
from
local
providers
rather
than
solely
at
VA
facilities.
This
is
especially
important
when
certain
ailments
would
require
a
veteran
to
travel
hundreds

to

It
could
cut
down
on
travel
inconveniences,
costs

federal

and
wait

PC-3
is
especially
important
for
rural

Southeast
Alabama.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
the
VA
to
ensure
that
PC-3
is
fully

all

are
actively
