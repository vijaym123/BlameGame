Weekly Column: Working To Protect Ohio's Energy Supply
and Preserve Ohio Jobs
The United States is fortunate to have more coal than any other country
in the world. A vital resource that provides over half of our country's
electricity, coal supports more than 550,000 jobs. I fully understand
the importance of keeping this abundant natural resource a part of
America's energy supply, and more specifically Ohio's energy supply.
According to the Environmental Information Agency, there are 55
coal-fired units in Ohio that produce more than 24 million tons of coal
per year. Coal generates over 50 percent of our state's electricity and
the industry employs thousands of Ohioans. Read more HERE
