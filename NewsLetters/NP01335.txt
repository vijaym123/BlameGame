Dear
Friend,
I am pleased to announce
that I have joined the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee
for the 114th Congress. As the only physicist in Congress, I am
excited to have this opportunity to stand up for science and fact-based
debate.
I'm also
excited for this opportunity because I know how important it is for the
United States to maintain our position as the leader in science and
technology. Serving on this committee will allow me to better advocate for
sustained investments in research and development and support
Illinoiss national laboratories.
Congressman Foster touring Argonne National
Laboratory and speaking with
researchers.
We have two important
national labs right here in Illinois - Argonne National Laboratory and
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The work done at these labs not
only supports our local economy, employing as many as 4,725 people in
Illinois, but is critical to our nations long-term economic success. It
is essential we continue to fully support funding for our national
labs to preserve our global competitive advantage. My position on the
House Science, Space, and Technology Committee will allow me to better
advocate for these vital institutions.
While serving on the full committee, I will also be
joining the Science Subcommittee on the Environment, which looks at
research being done to
determine
the impact climate change is having on our planet. I look forward to
delving into the fact-based analysis done by government agencies like
the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) ,
the
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA).

Foster
