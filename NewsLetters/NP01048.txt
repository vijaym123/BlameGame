As the United States moves ahead with negotiating
two of the biggest free trade deals in the history of the world, it is
important to take a step back and examine the benefits these deals
could bring to Hoosiers. Indianas economy is heavily based in
manufacturing and agriculture. The success of these businesses is dependent on
the ability to access as many consumers as possible. The trade deals
being discussed will help create expanded access to Hoosier products for
consumers around the world.
Free Trade and
Hoosiers
These trade agreements would open markets for
U.S. job creators to nearly 1 billion consumers, covering nearly
two-thirds of global GDP and 65% of global trade. Finalizing these two
agreements would allow the United States to set 21 st
century
trade standards for the world. It is crucial that the United States have a
leading role in rewriting the global trade rules and does not forfeit
that role to countries like China. Forfeiting that role will be
harmful to Hoosier businesses and workers.
Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)
is designed to clarify the joint role
of Congress and the administration while negotiating trade deals with
foreign countries. TPA-2015 clarifies Congress constitutional
authority within trade negotiations by setting trade negotiating objectives
and ensures consultation with Congress. Furthermore, the process
streamlines House and Senate consideration of trade deals should the
administration meet mandated objectives. This process thereby empowers U.S.
trade negotiators, allowing them to secure the best offers from
negotiating partners. Specifically, TPA institutes three core
provisions:
1.
Specifically mandates nearly 150 negotiation objectives.
2.
Mandates
consultation requirements, ensuring Congressional oversight of negotiations
and allowing their direct involvement in negotiations
3.
Expedited
floor consideration, providing confidence to negotiation partners that
Congress will not re-write trade agreements, enabling the U.S. Trade
Representative to negotiate the best deal possible.
TPA is not
a plan to hand over unchecked negotiating power to the administration.
By passing TPA, Congress is able to set forth a concrete plan to
oversee and influence the negotiations. Instead of acting as a bystander
in the negotiations, Congress is now a partner with the administration
in order to come to an agreement with the best possible terms for
Hoosiers.
What Weve Done
In order
to provide for effective and efficient Congressional consideration of
TPP, Congress began the process of considering TPA. On April 17, 2015,
Chairman Paul Ryan introduced
H.R. 1890, the
Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities &amp; Accountability Act , to
renew TPA through July 1, 2018. The House Ways and Means Committed
marked up and passed H.R. 1890 with my support on April 23, 2015, by a
bipartisan vote of 25-13.
