Resources
Are you a
victim of
government?
Sen. Johnson strongly believes that the
root cause of America's social and economic problems lies in the
excessive laws, rules, and regulations that constitute the government's
intrusion in our lives. If you have had, or are currently having, issues
dealing with the federal agencies that mandate these restrictions, we
would like to hear your story and work with you to resolve the issues.
Share your story with Ron's professional staff by emailing us
at
VictimsofGovernment@ronjohnson.senate.gov .
