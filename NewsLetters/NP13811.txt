Dear
Friend,
For many, Thanksgiving is a break from work
or at least from a strict diet.
It turns out it wasn't a break
from news stories about the ways Obamacare is failing the American
people. Reports are continuing to mount about the difficulties people are
having signing up, the household budgets feeling the strain, and the
concern over the care families might actually get.
The end
of the year isn't going to bring the end of these
problems.
If you haven't heard, I'm having a
telephone town hall
meeting on Tuesday night at 7:00 .
It's a good chance
for us to talk about you're experiences, the things you're hearing, and
your ideas for solutions.
We try to call as many folks as
possible, but just to make sure we reach you Tuesday night, you can
sign up
here .
I'm
looking forward to it!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
In case
you missed it...
