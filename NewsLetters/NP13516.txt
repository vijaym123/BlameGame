The Rigell Report: Christmas at Arlington Cemetery, Defending Our Veterans
Dear Friend,
Last weekend thousands of Americans, including some members of my family and staff, laid wreaths on graves at Arlington National Cemetery. This effort was led in part by our offices Military Liaison, Bre Kingsbury. She helped raise $21,000 to sponsor 1,400 wreaths.
My daughter Lindsey came home from that experience deeply moved and said, Dad, every American should visit Arlington.
Shes right.
A visit to Arlington National Cemetery is a powerful reminder of the sacrifice that has been made for our freedom. And, to me, Arlington is a powerful reminder of that which binds us together ... before all else, we are fellow Americans. On Arlington's hallowed grounds, now blanketed with evergreen, there are no Republican or Democrat tombstones. All have sacrificed for the country we love.
From our family to yours, especially to those who wear our nation's uniform and our Gold Star families, we wish you Merry Christmas.
Mindful that I work for you, I remain
Yours in Freedom,
Scott Rigell

Recently Congress passed a budget agreement to address the impact of sequestration on our region, reduce the nations deficit, and help restore regular order. However, the bill unfairly affects the military retiree Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) rates.
In response, Scott cosponsored legislation to fully reverse the COLA decrease. Read the text of that legislation
here .
Scott also delivered the commencement address at Old Dominion University last week.
He spoke about citizenship and passing on the blessings of liberty and freedom to the next generation of Americans.

You Should Go!
to Fort Monroe!
Fort Monroe, a national historic landmark in Hampton, Virginia, was built for coastal defense between 1819 and 1834. The largest stone fortification built in the United States, Fort Monroe has been called The Fortress of Freedom and The Gibraltar of the Chesapeake.
The fort, which sits in Virginias second congressional district, is being transferred back to our Commonwealth pursuant to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process.
Scott was a leader in ensuring that Fort Monroe became a national monument in 2011.
A National Historic Landmark, Fort Monroe holds special cultural and historical meaning for the community, and has roles in the beginning and end of slavery in America.

Quote Worthy
For, more than just a day, Christmas is a state of mind. It is found throughout the year whenever faith overcomes doubt, hope conquers despair, and love triumphs over hate. It is present when men of any creed bring love and understanding to the hearts of their fellow man. The feeling is seen in the wondrous faces of children and in the hopeful eyes of the aged. It overflows the hearts of cheerful givers and the souls.
-- President Ronald Reagan
