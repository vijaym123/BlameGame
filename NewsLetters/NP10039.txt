Congressional Report -- Week of April 28 - May 2: Public
Service Recognition Week Event in San Antonio Office
Hello Friend,
It was a busy week in Washington, D.C. I met with constituents from
23rd District of Texas. I attended hearings in House Armed Services and
Agriculture Committees. On Armed Services, we are working on the annual
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Unlike many bills, the NDAA
has passed annually for more than 50 years in a row. On Agriculture, we
are working on livestock and labeling issues. On Thursday afternoon, I
headed back to Texas to spend Friday and the weekend working in San
Antonio.
Meanwhile, our field representatives were busy, too. They worked in San
Antonio, Hondo, Castroville, Uvalde, Eagle Pass, Carrizo Springs, Del
Rio, Balmorhea, Monahans, Grandfalls, Fort Stockton, Presidio and
Terlingua. It's a big district, but we cover it all.

Public Service Recognition Week Event in San Antonio Office
On Friday, I hosted an event in San Antonio in honor of Public Service
Recognition Week, which will run from May 4-10. During the next couple
of days, please thank those public servants who we see every day but
many times take for granted - law enforcement officers, postal workers,
firefighters, inspectors, caseworkers or receptionists. These people,
and many more public servants, make our lives safer, easier and better.
Through constituent services I provide and the efforts of public
servants in various federal agencies, our office has been able to
recover over $2.5 million owed to constituents of the 23rd District of
Texas. I'm really proud of that.
Joining us at the event were public servants from the U.S. Department
of State, Department of Veterans Affairs, United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services, the Social Security Administration, the Small
Business Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. To see

Uvalde Job Fair a Huge Success
On Tuesday, my office hosted a job fair in Uvalde, Texas. It was the
first job fair there in the last five years. More than 200 people
attended the job fair and over 35 employers participated. Thanks to our
co-hosts, Southwest Texas Junior College and the Uvalde Area Chamber of
Commerce for their work in making the fair a resounding success.
Among the potential employers participating in the job fair were local
law enforcement agencies, school districts, state and federal agencies,
local small businesses, aerospace and engineering firms, and
agriculture and medical sector businesses.
Providing people the resources and tools to find jobs is a priority of
mine. Dr. Hector Gonzales, president of Southwest Texas Junior College,
and Olivia Rish, executive director of the Uvalde Area Chamber of
Commerce, are pretty passionate about it, too. We all get more things
done by working together. I'll continue to work with businesses - large
and small - throughout the 23rd District of Texas to bring more jobs
and opportunities to our state. For more on this job fair, click here

Office hosted 2014 Jobs Fair in Uvalde, Texas. More than 200 people and
35 potential employers participated.
Uvalde Community Health Center Receives $1.2 Million
Last week, I shared the news that Community Health Development Inc. in
Uvalde County received $1,201,415 in federal funds. The funds will
continue to operate the health center, which also prioritizes
prevention. It's a wonderful facility that helps people de-stress
through exercise, teaches people about nutrition and cooking healthy,
and does many things to help people stay stronger and live longer.
These federal funds are made available through the Department of Health
and Human Services.
Community Health Development Inc. provides access to quality,
affordable health care services to the people of Uvalde, Real, Edwards
and parts of Zavala Counties. For more on these funds, click here
.
Lastly, I always end by saying thank you - thank you for letting me be
your voice in Washington. My goal is to bring some Southwest Texas
common-sense to a place where common sense can seem in short supply. If
I can help you with a federal agency or issue, or if you have any
complaints about or suggestions for federal government, please call on
any of our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed below.
I'm not a big fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of
the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
