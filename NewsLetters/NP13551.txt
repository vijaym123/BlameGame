SERVING YOU

December 15, 2013
Dear Friend,
As a Member of Congress, my primary responsibility is to cast
votes and draft legislation on your behalf.
I also have a lot
of opportunities to serve you personally, which of course is why I have
a district office in Gainesville.
One of
the highlights of this job is the opportunity I have to nominate
students for admission to our highly-competitive military service
academies.
These academies each have rich histories of providing
world-class training to our men and women in uniform.
Because this is
their mission, they look for the best and the brightest young people in
the country who have proven their dedication to excellence through
outstanding academic achievement and service to the
community.
I think its good news for Northeast Georgia
that these nominations were some tough decisions to make.
With
so many sharp young people who are dedicated to academic excellence
and serving others, the future of our community is
bright.
Weve made individual announcements for each of these
nominees, but I wanted you to see everyone Ive nominated for
acceptance to our military service academies this year.
If you know them
or any of their family members, please take a moment to wish them the
best:
