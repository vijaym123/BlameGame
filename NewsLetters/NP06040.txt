Dear Friends,
I'm
pleased to share with you that my Academy Day in South Charleston on
Sunday was a great success! Many families -- including the Westfalls,
pictured above -- attended to learn more about the opportunities offered by
our nation's service academies.
And for those of you
living in the Eastern Panhandle, please don't forget -- Sunday is my
Academy Day in Charles Town!
As a member of Congress, I have the
privilege of nominating a select group of individuals for admission to
the United States service academies: Army, Navy, Air Force and
Merchant Marine. Dozens of students I have nominated have been accepted to
these academies and have served us honorably in the armed
forces.
I encourage students interested in a career in the military and
their parents or guardians to attend my upcoming Academy Day to learn
more about the opportunities available at our nation's service
academies:
Sunday, September 28, 2014
2-4

The number of available
appointments is highly competitive, so I encourage students interested in
applying to attend one of my Academy Days or contact my Charleston office
at (304) 925-5964 as soon as possible for more
information.
Applicants should be residents of the Second Congressional District
of West Virginia and between the ages of 17 and 22. The deadline for
receiving all required information is
Friday, Oct. 31,
2014.

WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF OSTEOPATHIC
MEDICINE
On Thursday, I had the
opportunity to visit West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine in Lewisburg,
where I met with students and learned more about the school's
educational opportunities. I am pictured here with President Michael Adelman
and Vice President of Academic Affairs Craig Boisvert.
MAKING HIGHER
EDUCATION ACCESSIBLE
More than 17,000 West
Virginia students will have access to higher education planning and
readiness services, thanks to a $21 million grant announced this week by the
U.S. Department of Education. The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness
for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) grant to the West Virginia
Higher Education Policy Commission will allow the commission to conitnue
offering services to help West Virginia students find the path to higher
education that's right for them.
Higher education is the
key to a better future. The GEAR UP program will help West Virginia's
students find the educational path that's right for them -- a trade
school, two-year degree program or a traditional four-year college. This
grant program is highly competitive, and I am proud that West Virginia
has been recognized for its efforts to expand access to higher
education and create brighter futures for all students.
Thank you for reading
my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in
the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
