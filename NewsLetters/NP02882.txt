Friends,
On Wednesday evening, February 18, at 7:30pm, I&rsquo;ll be holding a
tele-town hall
focused on ways to reform our tax code.
I want to hear about your experiences navigating our current tax system. And I want to hear your ideas about how we can make the system work better.
If you&rsquo;re interested in participating, please
click here
or call my Wilmington office at 302-691-7333 or toll-free at 877-899-7872 by 5:00pm on Tuesday. If you
sign up , you&rsquo;ll receive a phone call around 7:30pm Wednesday evening that will enable you to ask questions during the call and listen to my answers. The call will last an hour.
I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to join me.
Sincerely,
Please do not respond to this email.
