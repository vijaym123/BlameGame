Dear Friend:
After five long years, the release of Alan Gross is a joyous moment for his family, his friends and all Americans who have worked and prayed for this day.
Today opens a new chapter in U.S.-Cuba relations that rejects the failed policies of the past and embraces a new future that will better serve America's interests and improve the lives of Cubans and their families. To learn more about President Obama's historic announcement, please click

As I learned during a trip I made to Cuba in 2002 with the agricultural community from California, turning the page in U.S.-Cuban relations will have enormous economic opportunities. There will be many other benefits as well, and that is why I fully support this breakthrough.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
