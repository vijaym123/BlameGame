Yesterday was U-N-B-E-L-I-E-V-A-B-L-E. FIRST:
House Republicans authorized a vote to sue a sitting President: it&rsquo;s never happened in U.S. HISTORY. THEN:
Vice President Biden emailed asking you to defend President Obama. FINALLY:
Something truly amazing happened. Over 25,945 donations came in to Democratic Headquarters to take down Boehner's Republicans.
David, you're one of our strongest supporters, so we want to make sure you're a part of this.
We're 14,055 away from hitting 40,000 donations since Republicans authorized a lawsuit vote.
If you stand with President Obama against this unprecedented lawsuit today, we'll triple match your gift! Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00 ALL GIFTS TO THIS EMAIL TRIPLE-MATCHED!
