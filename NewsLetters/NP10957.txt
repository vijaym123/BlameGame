Dear fellow New Jerseyans,
March
31st would have been Cesar Estrada Chavezs 87th birthday.
For
the last eight years, Ive marked this day by introducing a resolution
honoring this great American civil rights leader who helped change the
course of our nations history.
Yet, for the eighth time, right
wing Republicans said no and would not allow it to
pass.
Cesar Chavez deserves to be remembered
and honored by the United States Senate. He dedicated his life to
fighting for equality, justice, and dignity
not only for Latino workers,
but for all workers in the United States. The President has
proclaimed March 31, 2014 Cesar Chavez Day and over ten states honor his legacy
each year on this day.
Yet, Republicans cant find it in their
hearts to join us in recognizing
him.
There is strong support in our community for honoring Cesar
Chavezs legacy and Im proud to have stood on the Senate floor to
recall his contributions to working people and to call on the Senate to
give Cesar Chavez that recognition he so rightly deserves.

And I want you to know this
I will be back next year, and
every year, to stand up and fight to see the day that Cesar Chavez
and
the immeasurable contributions of Latinos
receive the proper
commemoration.
Si se puede.
Adelante,
Robert Menendez
United States Senator
