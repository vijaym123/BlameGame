President Obama asked.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz pleaded.
And bless his heart, James Carville begged.
We wouldn't all be emailing you today if it wasn't so important.
Right now, President Obama is facing a Republican opposition unlike anything we've seen. All told, we're being outspent nearly 3-to-1.
The only way we can withstand this barrage of corporate interest attacks is with your support. And right now, we're still coming up 56,301 donations short. Can I count on you? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
