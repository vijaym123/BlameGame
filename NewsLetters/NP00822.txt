Dear Hoosier,
Prescription drug abuse and heroin use is a serious problem around the country, including in Indiana. Addressing the growing heroin and ongoing prescription drug abuse epidemics is a top priority of mine. I recently reintroduced
The Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act
with my friend Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire.
