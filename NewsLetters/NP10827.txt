Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
As your representative, one of my top priorities is not only protecting
our national security, but our local economic security as well.
That's
why I circulated a letter to my colleagues in Congress to support the
production of 22 EA-18G Growlers for the United States Navy, which
would support over 5,000 jobs in the St. Louis Region.
Right now, we
have over 30 co-signers on the letter who all agree this is a top Navy
priority in maintaining our military readiness.
In Missouri, the FA/18 program, which is built on the same production
line as the Growler, contributes to 13,000 jobs from 91 different
suppliers, resulting in $640 million annually.
Without adding more
Growlers next year in the budget, the St. Louis production line will
start to close and the last jet will be delivered in 2016.
Yesterday, I testified before the House Appropriations subcommittee on
Defense to support this vital program.
This week, I wrote an op-ed in The Hill about the importance of the
EA-18G Growler to our national security.
Next week, I look forward to testifying about our Saint Louis
production and the Navy's need for more Growlers in front of the House
Armed Services Committee.
Fighting for our Veterans:
As a mother of a soldier currently serving his nation - I have the
utmost respect for those who have answered the call to defend freedom.
That's why I was outraged over reports from constituents that the
Missouri Veterans Commission is not filing claims on behalf of our
nation's heroes.
As a result, I have demanded a full audit and an investigation into the
Missouri Veterans Commission.
One veteran missing out on benefits they
earned because someone neglected to do their job is one veteran too
many-and so far my office has heard from six veterans affected by this
egregious level of incompetence and neglect.
If you are a veteran and have filed a claim with the Missouri Veterans
Commission, and felt that your claim was not processed, please email me
at ann.wagnermo02@mail.house.gov or call my District Office at (636)
779-5449 and ask to speak with Erin Olson.
Protecting Jobs:
This week, I voted to restore Americans' work hours so they can have
more opportunity and a bigger paycheck.
The Save the American Workers
Act would repeal ObamaCare's 30-hour work week and replace it with the
traditional 40 hour work week.
Due to the looming employer mandate, businesses are reducing workers'
hours to 29 hours per week or less to avoid ObamaCare's high costs and
taxes - leaving millions of middle and low-wage workers with less take
home pay.
I recently heard from Jim from St. Louis who wrote to me
that his daughter just lost her job due to the cost of health care.
As
a result, the company eliminated jobs in order to keep their doors
open.
For those employees who still have their jobs, the business
reduced their hours because they cannot afford to provide the health
insurance required under ObamaCare.
At a time when 75% of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the
government should promote job growth and economic prosperity instead of
higher taxes. This common-sense legislation will protect jobs and
restore wages to provide financial stability for American families.
As always, it is an honor to serve you and I look forward to speaking
with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Ann's
Weekly
Roundup
Dear
Friend,
As
your
representative,
one
of
my
top
priorities
is
not
only
protecting
our
national
security,
but
our
local
economic
security
as
well.
That's
why
I
circulated
a
letter
to
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
support
the
production
of
22
EA-18G
Growlers
for
the
United
States
Navy,
which
would
support
over
5,000
jobs
in
the
St.
Louis
Region .
Right
now,
we
have
over
30
co-signers
on
the
letter
who
all
agree
this
is
a
top
Navy
priority
in
maintaining our
military
readiness.
In
Missouri,
the
FA/18
program,
which
is
built
on
the
same
production
line
as
the
Growler,
contributes
to
13,000
jobs
from
91
different
suppliers,
resulting
in
$640
million
annually.
Without
adding
more
Growlers
next
year
in
the
budget,
the
St.
Louis
production
line
will
start
to
close
and
the
last
jet
will
be
delivered
in
2016.
Yesterday,
I
testified
before
the
House
Appropriations
subcommittee
on
Defense
to
support
this
vital
program.
This
week,
I
wrote
an
op-ed
in
The
Hill
about
the
importance
of
the
EA-18G
Growler
to
our
national
security.
Next
week,
I
look
forward
to
testifying
about
our
Saint
Louis
production
and
the
Navy&#8217;s
need
for
more
Growlers
in
front
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee.
Fighting
for
our
Veterans:
As
a
mother
of
a
soldier
currently
serving
his
nation
&#8211;
I
have
the
utmost
respect
for those
who
have
answered
the
call
to
defend
freedom.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
outraged
over
reports
from
constituents
that
the
Missouri
Veterans
Commission
is
not
filing
claims
on
behalf
of
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes.
As
a
result,
I
have
demanded
a
full
audit
and
an
investigation
into
the
Missouri
Veterans
Commission.
One
veteran
missing
out
on
benefits
they
earned
because
someone
neglected
to
do their
job
is
one
veteran
too
many &#8212;and
so
far
my
office
has
heard
from
six
veterans
affected
by
this
egregious
level
of
incompetence
and
neglect.
If
you
are
a
veteran
and
have
filed
a
claim
with
the
Missouri
Veterans
Commission,
and
felt
that
your
claim
was
not
processed,
please
email
me
at
ann.wagnermo02@mail.house.gov
or
call
my
District
Office
at
(636)
779-5449
and
ask
to
speak
with
Erin
Olson.
Protecting
Jobs:
This
week,
I
voted
to
restore
Americans&#8217;
work
hours
so
they
can have
more
opportunity
and
a
bigger
paycheck .
The
Save
the
American
Workers
Act
would
repeal
ObamaCare&#8217;s
30-hour
work
week
and
replace
it
with
the
traditional
40
hour
work
week.
Due
to
the
looming
employer
mandate,
businesses
are
reducing
workers&#8217;
hours
to
29
hours
per
week
or
less
to
avoid
ObamaCare&#8217;s
high
costs
and
taxes
&#8211;
leaving
millions
of
middle
and
low-wage
workers
with
less
take
home
pay.
I
recently
heard
from
Jim
from
St.
Louis
who
wrote
to
me
that
his
daughter
just
lost
her
job
due
to
the
cost
of
health
care.
As
a
result,
the
company eliminated
jobs
in
order
to
keep
their
doors
open.
For
those
employees
who
still
have
their
jobs,
the business
reduced
their
hours
because
they
cannot
afford
to
provide
the
health
insurance
required
under
ObamaCare.
At
a
time
when
75%
of
Americans
are
living
paycheck-to-paycheck,
the
government
should
promote
job
growth
and
economic
prosperity
instead
of
higher
taxes.
This
common-sense
legislation
will
protect
jobs
and
restore
wages
to
provide
financial
stability
for
American
families.
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
serve
you
and
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
again
soon.
Sincerely,
Ann
Wagner Member
of
Congress
