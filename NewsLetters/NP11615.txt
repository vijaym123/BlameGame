Dear Neighbor,
We were in Chemung County this morning meeting with Office of the Aging and AARP representatives to rollout our
Older Americans Act .
We're making the push to pass the five year reauthorization of nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, transportation services, support for family caregivers and services to prevent senior abuse and neglect.
At our recent
senior resource event
in Seneca County, we had conversations with seniors and their families on the need for the services this bill supports and we're proud to lead on reauthorization efforts.
REED: TAX REFORM PUTS $600 IN THE POCKETS OF SOUTHERN TIER, FINGER LAKES TAXPAYERS
The tax reform draft released last week would result in an additional $600 back in the pockets of 23 rd
district taxpayers &ndash; that&rsquo;s over 160 gallons of gas or six months of electric bills. Real tax reform creates an opportunity for taxpayers to keep more of their own money instead of it going into the abyss in Washington. Hear more about the impact in
this clip .
REED VOTES IN FAVOR OF &ldquo;SIMPLE FAIRNESS ACT&rdquo;
The House passed bipartisan legislation this week to protect individuals and families from the Obamacare mandate penalty if they do not enroll in Obamacare this year. We&rsquo;re simply asking that individuals and families are afforded the same relief from Obamacare that big businesses have now been afforded by the White House not once, but twice. Families deserve a fair solution that protects all, not just some from having to pay the penalty.
&ldquo;HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT&rdquo; PASSES HOUSE WITH REED SUPPORT
Responding to
concerns we heard
from home and business owners, we are fairly protecting the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes from seeing sharp, immediate rate increases in their flood insurance premiums. In addition to protecting homeowners and businesses against skyrocketing flood insurance costs, the bill puts the National Flood Insurance Program on a long-term, solvent path.
REED MOVES TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY HOME HEATING RELIEF
We supported legislation this week to bring relief from the ongoing home heating fuel shortage and resulting price increase this winter. The high demand throughout this winter&rsquo;s extreme cold has outpaced supply and caused propane prices to skyrocket. Families need relief from energy bills and the comfort of knowing they will be able to heat their homes. We need to &ldquo;ease the squeeze&rdquo; felt by so many families. More on the &ldquo;HHEATT Act&rdquo;
