Notable & Quotable: Paul Ryan
Paul Ryan tells Commissioner John Koskinen why no one believes the IRS
June 20, 2014
Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen at a Ways
and Means Committee hearing, June 20:
Ryan: I am sitting here listening to this testimony. . . . I don't
believe it. That's your problem. Nobody believes you. The Internal
Revenue Service comes to Congress a couple of years ago and misleads us
and says no targeting is occurring.
Then it said it was a few rogue agencies in Cincinnati. Then it said it
was also on progressives. All those things have been proven untrue.
This committee sent a criminal referral of possible criminal
wrongdoing, just a month ago, to the Justice Department and we've heard
nothing. You bury, in a 27-page letter to the Senate, asking for them
to conclude the investigation, that you've lost Lois Lerner's emails
during the time in question because of a hard drive crash. . . . Monday
our investigators asked your agency whether any other hard drives
crashed and we learn that six other hard drives of the people we are
investigating were involved. . . . you didn't tell us that!
Koskinen: We told you on Monday.
. .
Ryan: You told us on Monday because we asked you whether any other hard
drives crashed. This is unbelievable. You told us in May that you were
going to give us all of Lois Lerner's emails and you learned in
February that this crashed.
Koskinen: I did not learn in February of the crash and we told you on
Monday.
Ryan: I'm not asking a question, I'm making a statement.
Koskinen: I'm sorry.
Ryan: You are the IRS. . . . You learned about this months ago, you
just told us, and we had to ask you on Monday. This is not being
forthcoming. This is being misleading again. This is a pattern of
abuse, a pattern of behavior, that is not giving us any confidence that
this agency is being impartial. I don't believe you.

Paul
Ryan
tells
Commissioner
John

why
no

believes

IRS
June
20,
2014
Rep.
Paul
Ryan
(R.,
Wis.)
and
IRS
Commissioner
John
Koskinen
at
a
Ways
and
Means
Committee
hearing,
June
20:
Ryan:
I
am
sitting
here
listening
to
this
testimony.
. . .
I
don't
believe
it.
That's
your
problem.
Nobody
believes
you.
The
Internal
Revenue
Service
comes
to
Congress
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
misleads
us
and
says
no
targeting
is
occurring.
Then
it
said
it
was
a
few
rogue
agencies
in
Cincinnati.
Then
it
said
it
was
also
on
progressives.
All
those
things
have
been
proven
untrue.
This
committee
sent
a
criminal
referral
of
possible
criminal
wrongdoing,
just
a
month
ago,
to
the
Justice
Department
and
we've
heard
nothing.
You
bury,
in
a
27-page
letter
to
the
Senate,
asking
for
them
to
conclude
the
investigation,
that
you've
lost
Lois
Lerner's
emails
during
the
time
in
question
because
of
a
hard
drive
crash.
. . .
Monday
our
investigators
asked
your
agency
whether
any
other
hard
drives
crashed
and
we
learn
that
six
other
hard
drives
of
the
people
we
are
investigating
were
involved.
. . .
you
didn't
tell
us
that!
Koskinen:
We
told
you
on
Monday.
. . .
Ryan:
You
told
us
on
Monday
because
we
asked
you
whether
any
other
hard
drives
crashed.
This
is
unbelievable.
You
told
us
in
May
that
you
were
going
to
give
us
all
of
Lois
Lerner's
emails
and
you
learned
in
February
that
this
crashed.
Koskinen:
I
did
not
learn
in
February
of
the
crash
and
we
told
you
on
Monday.
Ryan:
I'm
not
asking
a
question,
I'm
making
a
statement.
Koskinen:
I'm
sorry.
Ryan:
You
are
the
IRS.
. . .
You
learned
about
this
months
ago,
you
just
told
us,
and
we
had
to
ask
you
on
Monday.
This
is
not
being
forthcoming.
This
is
being
misleading
again.
This
is
a
pattern
of
abuse,
a
pattern
of
behavior,
that
is
not
giving
us
any
confidence
that
this
agency
is
being
impartial.
I
don't
believe
