NY Times : GOP mounts a &ldquo;blatant, dangerous effort to undercut the President&rdquo;
David -- It&rsquo;s an outrageous show of contempt.
That&rsquo;s the only way to describe the actions of the Senate Republicans who sent a letter meant to undermine President Obama
directly to the leaders of Iran . It&#39;s UNBELIEVABLE.
The GOP&rsquo;s disgusting letter wasn&rsquo;t just disrespectful but RECKLESS -- and it threatened the separation of powers required by the Constitution!
No question: Republicans crossed the line.
And we CAN&rsquo;T let them get away with it.

The
New York Times
nailed it: &ldquo;[Senate] Republicans seem to think their role is outside the American government, divorced from constitutional principles, tradition and the security interests of the American people.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s UNACCEPTABLE. And with your contribution, we&rsquo;ll make Republicans see what a
huge
