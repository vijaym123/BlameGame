This week, the President unveiled
his budget for Fiscal Year 2015, a budget that - if passed
would
devastate our economy and add a crushing debt burden onto our
children.
The Presidents plan would raise taxes by $1.7
trillion, increase spending by $791 billion, and add $8.3 trillion to
the debt over the next 10 years.
By 2024, the national debt would
be $25 trillion
or about $200,000 per American taxpayer.
Quite simply, the Presidents budget spends too much, taxes too much, and
borrows too much.
We can do better.
In 2011, I was an
original cosponsor of the Cut, Cap, and Balance plan, which passed
the House in a bipartisan vote.
This plan would have capped
federal spending, cut spending gradually over the next 10 years, and
passed a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.
However, Senate Democrats wouldnt consider our plan.
They wouldnt
even bring it up for a vote.
What we ended up with was the
sequester
a compromise that, despite some initial problems, did start
putting the government on a fiscally-sustainable path.
Since
the sequester was signed into law, the budget deficit has been cut in
half and the economy has grown at a faster pace.
The stock
market is at an all-time high.
And yet, the President wants to gut
all that progress.
Instead of working with Republicans to expand
the policies that have caused gradual progress since 2011, he wants to
go back to the Big Government policies of his first two years
policies that devastated our economy.
Where is the
Presidents plan to create jobs, grow our economy, and balance the
budget?
Where is his plan to reform the tax code, increase
domestic energy production, prevent our health care system from going
bankrupt, and save Medicare and Social Security?
What exactly does
President Obama want to accomplish during his next three years in
office?
The budget he released this week provides no answer.
And
thats because there isnt one.
America is
experiencing a major debt crisis.
As weve seen in places from
Detroit to Greece, the rapid growth of government spending and debt is
unsustainable and eventually leads to economic ruin.
Now is the
time for both parties to come together to put America on a
fiscally-healthy path.
I will continue to advocate for the
policies that have helped America since 2011, and I will continue to
oppose the policies that will harm that progress
whether thats the
Presidents budget, the
omnibus spending bill
that
passed Congress in January, or other policies
even those supported by
Republicans
that would expand government at the expense of the
private sector.
The Presidents Big Government budget
is simply more of the same.
To grow our economy and preserve
the American Dream, we need more freedom, more opportunity, and more
personal responsibility.
That is the change we need.
And that
is the change I will keep fighting for.
