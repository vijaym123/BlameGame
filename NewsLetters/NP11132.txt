Dear Friends,
March is Womens History Month, which originated in 1981
as a tribute to the generations of women who have served our country
and our world.
In
celebration, Id like to share with you one of Illinois very own
inspirations, Charlotte Thompson Reid, who represented the 15th District in
Congress.
Please click the picture below to hear about her
important contributions and her legacy which continues through her daughter,
former Illinois State Rep. Patricia Reid
Lindner.

Youre Invited to a
Hackathon!
As you may have heard in
a previous Hultgren Huddle, the House App Contest has begun. This
competition allows high school students to compete by creating and
exhibiting their software application, or app, for mobile, tablet or
computer devices on a platform of their choice.
While this may seem like a daunting task for a
student unfamiliar with computer coding, mentors are available to
help!
Fermilab computer
scientists will be hosting an app development day (or Hackathon) to
assist students with their computer programming on Saturday, March 29 from
1:00-5:00 p.m. at Wilson Hall.
For additional details and a
downloadable
flyer , please visit my website:

Fixing Medicare Payment Formula for Doctors and
Seniors
As health care
costs rise, it has become obvious the current formula for reimbursing
doctors who treat Medicare patients has become outdated, unrealistic and
unsustainable. The current system is based on the Sustainable Growth
Rate (SGR) formula which was enacted in 1997 but has failed to work.
Physicians face a 24 percent cut in Medicare payments on April 1 which
could lead to a drop in providing care to Medicare
patients.
We are already facing a serious
doctor shortage in this country and our seniors cannot afford for more
doctors to call it quits.
Thats why I supported passage of H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and
Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act, which would implement a
long-term fix to the formula. Previously, I joined a
bipartisan initiative
urging House Speaker John Boehner and House
Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to take action on this pressing issue,
and I am pleased Speaker Boehner brought the bill to the
floor.
Patients need to know doctors
will continue to provide for them, and doctors need to know they will
get paid for it. I urge the Senate to take up this alternative
formula and pass it quickly.
U.S. Chamber Presents Spirit of Enterprise Award for Pro-Jobs
Leadership
American
middle class families are hurting as they realize their paychecks
dont go as far as they used to, and Illinois unemployment rate still
sits above the national average. We need to pursue policies that will
encourage businesses to hire more workers and
innovate.
I was honored to receive the Spirit of
Enterprise award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for supporting
pro-growth, pro-jobs policies during the first session of the 113th
Congress. I look forward to the Senate and the President taking up
House-passed jobs legislation that will get Americans back to work. While this
list is just a sample, you can visit the following website for the
status of House-passed jobs bills:
