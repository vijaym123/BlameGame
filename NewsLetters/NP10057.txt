Wicker Commends Success of
Storm
Weather Technology
Advanced
Communication Tools Important to
Emergency
Response, Economic
Growth
Early last year, I joined the National Weather Service in Jackson
to celebrate state-of-the-art upgrades to its Doppler Weather Radar
system.
The life-saving potential of these improvements was
immediately apparent as a powerful tornado tore through the Hattiesburg area
in February.
On April 28 of
this year, as multiple tornados left a swath of destruction across
our state, the National Weather Service's early warning system again
proved its value in helping Mississippians get out of harm's way.
Although the storms took precious lives and caused extensive damage, we
can be thankful for the technology that provided critical information
ahead of time, alerting people to take shelter and potentially saving
hundreds of lives in the process.
The swift action of
forecasters, local officials, and first responders validated the importance of
coordination and communication when disaster strikes.
Boosting Internet Access and
Quality
Ensuring that all Americans benefit from communications
technology is a major component of my work on the Senate Commerce
Committee.
As the lead Republican on the Communications, Technology,
and the Internet Subcommittee, I have a key role in shaping
policymaking decisions to expand high-speed Internet access.
Connecting
Mississippians to vital communications tools has a positive impact on
business, education, health care, and emergency
response.
In many ways, the vast influence of the
Internet can be compared to the construction and reach of the Interstate
Highway System in the 1950s.
The deployment of broadband Internet
via DSL, fiber, wireless, and satellite has made tremendous strides in
boosting access and building infrastructure. This access and quality
are essential to economic development and the ability of our small
businesses
which once relied mostly on local customers
to compete in
new marketplaces.
Bridging the Digital
Divide
Challenges, however, still exist
in the widespread adoption of broadband Internet services, especially
in rural areas.
In fact, approximately one-third of Americans
forgo Internet access even when it is available to them, with many
citing concerns about the cost of service. Experts say Mississippi ranks
near the bottom among states when it comes to Internet
usage.
Federal policies that help foster
innovation can assist the broadband industry in providing cutting-edge
service to Mississippians at competitive rates.
Put simply,
today's telecommunications priorities should reflect new developments in
technology and how consumers prefer to receive information.
All
Americans
no matter where they live
should have the opportunity to
take full advantage of our emerging broadband economy.
Mississippi Launches Telehealth
Effort
One example of the power of technology to transform
lives and communities is Mississippi's new statewide telehealth
initiative, which Gov. Phil Bryant announced in January.
The effort
builds on a decade of Mississippi's telehealth success by coordinating a
team of public and private organizations to treat 200 diabetes patients
in the Delta.
With telehealth, care from clinicians at the
University of Mississippi Medical Center is available in local settings to
patients who might not be able to access these resources
otherwise.
Mississippians should not be
left behind when it comes to new technology and communication.
We know technological tools can make a real difference
boosting
economic growth, improving educational resources, and protecting lives and
property against the next big storm.
