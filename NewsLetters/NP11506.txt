Dear Friends,
March 2014 is Women's History Month.
It is a time we can reflect on the progress that has been made to
ensure women's rights and the challenges they still face. We must do more
and we will work hard to overcome these challenges. President Obama
stated in an official proclamation of Women's History Month," Let us
remember that when women succeed, America succeeds. And from Wall Street
to Main Street, in the White House and on Capitol Hill -- let us put
our Nation on the path to success." I join our President and many others
in Congress in continuing the fight for women's
equality.
I voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for
women to challenge pay discrimination. Women should not be making
less than what men make for the same work. I supported the Affordable
Care Act which bans insurance companies from charging women more because
of their gender. We must continue to work towards opening doors rather
than perpetuating the "glass ceiling" mentality that sets up unfair
obstacles for women from Wall Street to Main Street and even on the
battle field.
I have spent my entire tenure in Congress
supporting students who want to enter into the world of science. The numbers
are increasing but we need to do more. We must encourage our girls to
explore their passions for science and let them know that they can
earn careers around the world in the fields of science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM).
Women have shown
their courage throughout the centuries, as suffragettes fighting for the
right to vote, as astronauts, as teachers, and as heads of
corporations. Beginning last year, our courageous, patriotic and qualified women
will now be able to serve in opened ground combat units in our Armed
Forces!
As the father of four daughters I want their futures
and the futures of all women to be on a level playing field with
their male counterparts and not be weighed down by antiquated and biased
policies.
I invite everyone to visit this link
www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov to learn more about the women
throughout our history who have made great contributions to the United
States of America and to the world.
Sincerely,
Ruben Hinojosa
Member of Congress
