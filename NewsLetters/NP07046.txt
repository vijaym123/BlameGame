David -- we won&rsquo;t sugarcoat this.
We&rsquo;re in serious trouble.
And we need your help.
Voters are getting inundated with Obama-bashing Republican attacks
In total, we&rsquo;re being outspent 3-to-1
We only have 24 hours to close this $365,000 fundraising gap
David, there&rsquo;s no time left. If we don&rsquo;t fight back now, we&rsquo;ll have zero shot on Election Day.
According to our records, you haven't answered President Obama's call to action.

It&rsquo;s going to take a herculean effort to close this gap. But if everyone who receives this email chips in today, we can get back on track and hand Boehner a painful loss this November. Please -- chip in whatever you can today.
24-HOUR DEADLINE: All Gifts Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
