Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Helping
Nevadas brave men and women who have selflessly served our country is a top
priority for me. That is why I am pleased today to announce nearly
$10 million in grants from the Department of Labor to expand the
capacity of Nevada's community colleges to provide training programs for more
than 233,000 veterans and active duty military across
Nevada.
The grants are part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community
College and Career Training Grant Program. Nevadas community colleges
will use this grant funding to work with the Nevada System of Higher
Education, the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation,
and Nevadas Workforce Investment Boards to help active duty military,
veterans, and returning adult students leverage their experience and
increase their ability to earn higher wages.
These funds
will allow Nevadas military personnel to bring their unique skills and
knowledge learned from serving our country and put it to use in the
civilian workforce. With this funding, our states community colleges
will help ensure our service members have the ability to earn higher
wages and meet the needs of our states growing economy. I was glad to
support this effort and I thank the colleges and the entire Nevada System
of Higher Education for developing such a strong, competitive
proposal.
