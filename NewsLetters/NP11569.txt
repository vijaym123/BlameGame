Dear
Friend,
When
I
announced
in
January
that
this
would
be
my
last
year
serving
in
Congress,
I
was
clear
that
I
was
not
finished
trying
to
push
Congress
to
do
some
good-
especially
on issues
that
have
been
at
the
core
of
my
career
and
passions.
Foremost
among
those
priorities
is
passing
legislation
to
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
this
year
from
$7.25
per
hour
today
to
$10.10
an
hour
in
three
years.
Now,
a
new
report
shows
a
clear
majority
of
small
business
owners
support
raising
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
$10.10,
saying
it
will
increase
consumer
demand
that
will
help
them
grow
and
hire
more
workers.
This
is
an
important
step
in
the
push
to
get
this
bill
through
Congress
this
year.
It&#8217;s
simple:
when
workers
earn
higher
wages,
they
spend
their
extra
dollars
at
stores
in
their
communities.
Small
business
owners
clearly
understand
this
and
that&#8217;s
why
they
strongly
support
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage.
Raising
the
minimum-wage
is
a
pro-growth
policy
that
is
good
for
workers
who
should
not
have
to
live
in
poverty
while
working
full-time,
it&#8217;s
good
for
businesses,
and
it&#8217;s
good
for
the
economy.

more
about
the
new
report
