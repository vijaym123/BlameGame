Dear
Friend,
As you gather
this Veterans Day to pay tribute to those who have served our nation
with honor and courage, let me say thank you for recognizing these
heroes.
Let us today, and every day, express our
appreciation to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces for their
dedication and sacrifice.
A grateful nation thanks
them.
May God continue to bless our veterans, those in service to our
nation, their families and the United States of
America.
Most Respectfully,
John L. Mica
