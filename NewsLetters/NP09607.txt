HELLERS QUESTIONS
Last week, following allegations about
long wait times that may have led to the
deaths of veterans at the Phoenix VA
hospital, Heller sent Shinseki a letter
seeking answers about the wait times in the
Nevada system.
Opening Remarks as prepared:
Thank you Chairman Sanders and Ranking
Member Burr for holding this hearing
today.
What has come to light about the VA in
recent months has proven to Congress and
Veterans that there is a real problem with
accountability at all levels within the
Veterans Administration.
Poor management and care from the VA is
also a problem that Nevadas Veterans
are facing. This is not something that is
new, and in fact, this is something I have
raised repeatedly with the VA to no
avail.
I believe it is long overdue that this
Committee exerts its oversight and hold
leadership within the VA accountable.
Just last week I sent a letter to
Secretary Shinseki asking for immediate
answers about the lack of accountability on
the local level and whether VA leadership
finally plans to do something about
it.
I look forward to receiving a timely
response and substantive action on the
concerns I highlighted.
As Nevadas representative on this
Committee, I believe it is also my role and
responsibility to get answers for
Nevadas Veterans about the problems
they are facing with VA care and
benefits.
In Las Vegas, Veterans have complained
of excessive wait times in the Emergency
Department, which is too small to meet
demand.
Just a month ago, the VAs
Inspector General investigated VAs
treatment of a blind Veteran who waited 5
hours in the emergency room.
The IG also found that a quarter of
Veterans in the emergency room wait over
six hours before receiving care.
Furthermore, a Las Vegas Veteran wrote
to me that he went for care elsewhere
because the wait time for an appointment at
the VA was more than two months.
Given these concerns, as the VA
completes its face-to-face audits of VA
facilities, I want assurance that all of
Nevadas VA medical centers and
clinics will be thoroughly audited and that
I will be able to review the results
immediately.
As the Co-Chair of the VA Backlog
Working Group, I am also extremely
concerned with the claims backlog in
Nevada.
Although the Secretary promised me there
would be changes, Nevada veterans are still
waiting the longest at 355 days on average
for their claim to be processed.
When my office then requests the status
of Veterans claims, the Reno VARO is
often unresponsive.
It is unacceptable that local VA
officials would limit any congressional
offices ability get answers for
veterans.
Despite my repeated requests, this
ongoing issue has not been resolved.
At some point, I have to ask if these
problems in Nevada are a demonstration of
failed leadership at the top.
VA leadership is not holding local
officials accountable and is failing to
care for those who sacrificed on our
behalf.
And promises to change and do better for
our Veterans have not produced results. I
want changes, not empty promises.
If the VA continues on this course, then
I think it is ultimately time to look to
the top for these changes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
