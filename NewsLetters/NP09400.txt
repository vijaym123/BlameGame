A Special Memorial Day Message
Dear Friend,
On this sacred holiday, I would like to take a moment of your time and
stray a little bit from the usual Memorial Day message and share a
story from our own, Colonel Jack Jackson, USMCR (ret.).
Colonel
Jackson is an inspiration to all veterans and a true leader for our
community.
Most importantly - I am honored to call him a friend.
"Not long ago - I attended an event where I met a fellow veteran who
had lost a leg in combat in Afghanistan. This veteran was pushing a
wheel chair for a WWII veteran. After some introductions and a few war
stories, I thanked them for their service to our nation.
When I turned
to leave - the younger veteran asked me a question that still echoes in
my mind today:
'Colonel, we made it home, but many never returned. Did those who
perished on the battlefield die in vain?'
What an important question to ask, especially during a time of war - a
question that will always be asked by veterans and families of fallen
soldiers.
I told the two men that those brave patriots did not die in
vain and gave their last breath so we could breathe the sweet air of
freedom.
It's an important question to ask - because it is incumbent upon our
nation's leaders to ensure that our service members who sacrificed so
much on the field of battle did not die in vain. Now more than ever -
we need strong leaders in Congress to make sure our veterans are taken
care of with the highest level of dignity and respect as I did when I
came home.
I know our Congresswoman, Ann Wagner, stands with our patriots.
She is
working hard to improve the lives of our heroes, and is fighting every
day to fix the VA so that all veterans receive timely services and
care.
Just as FDR once said, 'A man who is willing to shed his blood
for our country deserves a square deal.' And with a son serving in the
United States Army on active duty, I know she takes this matter very
seriously.
I join Congresswoman Wagner in praying for the safety of all who serve.
I hope you join us in honoring this Memorial Day, and don't forget to
smell the sweet air of freedom. Because, without the sacrifices of our
brave men and women of our Armed Forces - we would not be the land of
the free and home of the brave."
Veterans like Colonel Jackson continue to be an inspiration for all
Americans - and we are lucky to have him in our St. Louis community.
On Memorial Day, we honor all of the brave men and women of our Armed
Forces who have fought so valiantly to defend our nation's freedom.
>From Washington crossing the Delaware to the sacred grounds of
Gettysburg and the distant mountains of Afghanistan - we pause and give
thanks to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice so we can be the land
of the free and home of the brave.
Their legacy lives on in the hearts
and memories of our mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, friends
and neighbors, and all Americans who cherish their service and
sacrifice to a grateful nation.
As we honor our fallen heroes, let us not forget those currently
serving in our Armed Forces today.
We pray for their safe return and
remain solemn in our covenant to serve them as well as they have served
the United States of America.
As a mother of a soldier currently serving in the 101st Airborne, I
believe it is our moral obligation to fix the atrocities unfolding at
the Department of Veterans Affairs - because those that have fought for
our freedom deserve the very best care our nation has to offer. Let us
all stand together and give thanks to our fallen heroes on this sacred
day, and recommit ourselves to honoring our veterans as much as they
have honored us.
It is truly an honor to serve you, and I look forward to speaking with
you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

A
Special
Memorial
Day
Message
Dear
Friend,
On
this
sacred
holiday,
I
would
like
to
take
a
moment
of
your
time
and
stray
a
little
bit
from
the
usual
Memorial
Day
message
and
share
a
story
from
our
own,
Colonel
Jack
Jackson,
USMCR
(ret.).
Colonel
Jackson
is
an
inspiration
to
all
veterans
and
a
true
leader
for
our
community.
Most
importantly
-
I
am
honored
to
call
him
a
friend.
&#8220;Not
long ago
-
I
attended
an
event
where
I
met
a
fellow
veteran
who
had
lost
a
leg
in
combat
in
Afghanistan.
This
veteran
was
pushing
a
wheel
chair
for
a
WWII
veteran.
After
some
introductions
and
a
few
war
stories,
I
thanked
them
for
their
service
to
our
nation.
When
I
turned
to
leave
-
the
younger
veteran
asked
me
a
question
that
still
echoes
in
my
mind
today:
&#8216;Colonel,
we
made
it
home,
but
many
never
returned.
Did
those
who
perished
on
the
battlefield
die
in
vain?&#8217;
What
an
important
question
to
ask,
especially
during
a
time
of
war
&#8211;
a
question
that
will
always
be
asked
by
veterans
and
families
of
fallen
soldiers.
I
told
the
two
men
that
those
brave
patriots
did
not
die
in
vain
and
gave
their
last
breath
so
we
could
breathe
the
sweet
air
of
freedom.
It&#8217;s
an
important
question
to
ask
&#8211;
because
it
is
incumbent
upon
our
nation's
leaders
to
ensure
that
our
service
members
who
sacrificed
so
much
on
the
field
of
battle
did
not
die
in
vain.
Now
more
than
ever
-
we
need
strong
leaders
in
Congress
to
make
sure
our
veterans
are
taken
care
of
with
the
highest
level
of
dignity
and
respect
as
I
did
when
I
came
home.
I
know
our
Congresswoman,
Ann
Wagner,
stands
with
our
patriots.
She
is
working
hard
to
improve
the
lives
of
our
heroes,
and
is
fighting
every
day
to
fix
the
VA
so
that
all
veterans
receive
timely
services
and
care.
Just
as
FDR
once
said,
&#8216;A
man
who
is
willing
to
shed
his
blood
for
our
country
deserves
a
square
deal.&#8217;
And
with
a
son
serving
in
the
United
States
Army
on
active
duty,
I
know
she
takes
this
matter
very
seriously.
I
join
Congresswoman
Wagner
in
praying
for
the
safety
of
all
who
serve.
I
hope
you
join
us
in
honoring
this
Memorial
Day,
and
don&#8217;t
forget
to
smell
the
sweet
air
of
freedom.
Because,
without
the
sacrifices
of
our
brave
men
and
women
of
our
Armed
Forces
&#8211;
we
would
not
be
the
land
of
the
free
and
home
of
the
brave."
Veterans
like
Colonel
Jackson
continue
to
be
an
inspiration
for
all
Americans
&#8211;
and
we
are
lucky
to
have
him
in
our
St.
Louis
community.
On
Memorial
Day,
we
honor
all
of
the
brave
men
and
women
of
our
Armed
Forces
who
have
fought
so
valiantly
to
defend
our
nation&#8217;s
freedom.
From
Washington
crossing
the
Delaware
to
the
sacred
grounds
of
Gettysburg
and
the
distant
mountains
of
Afghanistan
&#8211;
we
pause
and
give
thanks
to
those
who
paid
the
ultimate
sacrifice
so
we
can
be
the
land
of
the
free
and
home
of
the
brave.
Their
legacy
lives
on
in
the
hearts
and
memories
of
our
mothers
and
fathers,
sons
and
daughters,
friends
and
neighbors,
and
all
Americans
who
cherish
their
service
and
sacrifice
to
a
grateful
nation.
As
we
honor
our
fallen
heroes,
let
us
not
forget
those
currently
serving
in
our
Armed
Forces
today.
We
pray
for
their
safe
return
and
remain
solemn
in
our
covenant
to
serve
them
as
well
as
they
have
served
the
United
States
of
America.
As
a
mother
of
a
soldier
currently
serving
in
the
101st
Airborne,
I
believe
it
is
our
moral
obligation
to
fix
the
atrocities
unfolding
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
-
because
those
that
have
fought
for
our
freedom
deserve
the
very
best
care
our
nation
has
to
offer.
Let
us
all
stand
together
and
give
thanks
to
our
fallen
heroes
on
this
sacred
day,
and
recommit
ourselves
to
honoring
our
veterans
as
much
as
they
have
honored
us.
It
is
truly
an
honor
to
serve
you,
and
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
again
soon.
Sincerely,
Ann
Wagner Member
of
Congress
