Conaway Chronicle: House Passes Death Tax Repeal, Fighting the EPA's WOTUS Rule, Congressional Art Competition,
Petition to Lift the Oil Export Ban

Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
House Passes Death Tax Repeal
This week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, authored by fellow Texan Rep. Kevin Brady. As a CPA, I know from experience that the Death Tax hurts individuals who have worked hard and saved all of their lives in order to build up a nest egg for themselves and their families.
Farmers and ranchers are hit especially hard, because their assets are primarily land and equipment. When a farmer or rancher passes away, even though he has already paid taxes on everything he owns, the sons and daughters who want to carry on the family tradition will first have to get over the hurdle of a whopping tax penalty that can reach as high as 60 percent. The death tax hurts not only that next generation of farmers and ranchers, but it hobbles an important sector of our economy that creates economic activity and jobs. A repeal of the death tax is long overdue.
Fighting the EPA's WOTUS Rule
I joined several colleagues this week to introduce legislation to stop the EPA from implementing the Waters of the U.S. rule. In its current form, this rule continues EPAs massive overreach, leading to exorbitant permitting costs, red tape, and even effective loss of property use for landowners. This could happen even when the land or water in question has no impact on navigable or interstate waters meant to be protected under the law. This expansion of power will include virtually every ditch and pond in this country, impacting every industry from agriculture to energy. Im proud to be a cosponsor of The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015 to stop EPAs power grab.
Congressional Art Competition
Congratulations to Judith Horton for winning this year's Congressional Art Competition! Judith is a junior at Goldthwaite High School in Goldthwaite, Texas. Her piece will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol building for the next year.
Thanks to all the students who submitted their artwork and all those who worked tirelessly to make this event happen. It is truly a special day when we can see on display the work of the talented students of the 11th district.
Petition to Lift the Oil Export Ban
Energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high, but there are many regulations limiting the exportation of certain energy sources, such as oil and natural gas. I've signed on to two pieces of legislation that would lift the oil export ban. Currently, there is a petition being circulated instructing the Obama Administration to lift the oil export ban that I'd like to bring to your attention. You can find the petition by

Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
