News from Representative John Delaney
April 12, 2014
Dear Friend,
We've got too much gridlock on the road and too much gridlock in
Congress. But I'm committed to doing something about it.
My infrastructure bill, the Partnership to Build America Act, is now
the largest bipartisan bill in Congress, with over 30 members from both
parties as cosponsors. When I started working on this bill people told
me that true bipartisanship wouldn't be possible. But the truth is, I'm
not surprised: when you can create over a million jobs in a fiscally
responsible way and help our private sector compete, you'll find plenty
of supporters.
The latest news on the Partnership to Build America Act took place this
week. On Tuesday, I testified before the House Committee on
Transportation & Infrastructure's special panel on public-private
partnerships in infrastructure
. The invitation from the
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee to discuss the bill was
another step forward towards building further support. Right now, 31
Republicans in the House have reached across the aisle to support my
legislation.
You can watch my remarks to the panel here
.
Rebuilding our nation's infrastructure in order to strengthen the
economy should be a top priority. First, we have to take action to grow
our middle class and give more Americans an opportunity to succeed.
Second, we can't compete globally with a crumbling infrastructure. Last
year the American Society of Civil Engineers gave America's
infrastructure a D+ grade. A strong infrastructure leads to good middle
class jobs in transportation, energy, logistics, and construction in
the short term. In the long term, it also leads to a healthier private
sector overall.
If we give our workers, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs a level
playing field - with world class highways and ports, low-cost energy,
new schools and stable and secure dams and bridges - I know we'll win
in the global economy.
Sincerely,
John

Dear
Friend,
We&#8217;ve
got
too
much
gridlock
on
the
road
and
too
much
gridlock
in
Congress.
But
I&#8217;m
committed
to
doing
something
about
it.
My
infrastructure
bill,
the
Partnership

Act,
is
now
the
largest

Congress,
with
over
30

When
I
started
working
on
this
bill
people
told
me
that
true
bipartisanship
wouldn&#8217;t
be
possible.
But
the
truth
is,
I&#8217;m
not
surprised:
when
you
can
create
over
a
million
jobs
in
a
fiscally

way
and
help
our
private

compete,
you&#8217;ll
