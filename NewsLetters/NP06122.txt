Fighting Energy Insecurity
Earlier this week, I released a joint report
on the effects of rising energy costs
on American families-specifically those in South Carolina and Alaska,
two states with especially high energy needs.
The study suggested
that just a 10 percent increase in energy costs could push an
additional 840,000 Americans into poverty.

Honoring Women in Leadership
This past Monday, I was excited to launch the "Women in Leadership"
discussion series, with our first event featuring former HP CEO Carly
Fiorina.
Dedicated to my amazing mother, Frances Scott, we had a robust
discussion on the issues women face in the workplace, home, and
community at large.
The discussion was inspiring, informative, and sobering as we all seek
to ensure that women are fully represented as half of the creativity,
ingenuity, and brain power in our country.
Thank you very much to all who made our event possible, and I am
looking forward to the opportunity to host the second event in the
"Women in Leadership" discussion series.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your voice in the United
States Senate.
If I or my office can ever be of service to you, please
don't hesitate to contact me at (843) 727-4525, or you can email me
here
.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
