Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

Speaker Establishing Select Committee To Investigate Benghazi
Speaker John Boehner (R, Ohio-8) announced Friday that he intends for
the House of Representatives to vote for the creation of a new select
committee to investigate the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack in
Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans.
John Boehner
I support the move by the speaker, who stated, "Americans learned this
week that the Obama Administration is so intent on obstructing the
truth about Benghazi that it is even willing to defy subpoenas issued
by the standing committees of the People's House. These revelations
compel the House to take every possible action to ensure the American
people have the truth about the terrorist attack on our consulate that
killed four of our countrymen. In light of these new developments, the
House will vote to establish a new select committee to investigate the
attack, provide the necessary accountability, and ensure justice is
finally served.
"The administration's withholding of documents - emails showing greater
White House involvement in misleading the American people - is a
flagrant violation of trust and undermines the basic principles of
oversight upon which our system of government is built. And it forces
us to ask the question, what else about Benghazi is the Obama
Administration still hiding from the American people?"
Subcommittee Takes Another Crack At Chemicals In Commerce Act
My Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy last week continued its
review of draft legislation to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA). The Chemicals in Commerce Act (CICA)
, which I have
authored, aims to improve public confidence in the safety of chemicals
produced and used in the United States, and to facilitate interstate
commerce in American-made chemicals and the products that contain them.
The subcommittee reviewed an initial draft of the legislation in March.
Tuesday, it reviewed an updated draft, which reflects changes from
members on both sides of the aisle, stakeholders, and the
administration.
I appreciate all of our committee colleagues who have put so much time
and effort into this legislative effort. TSCA reform is neither easy
nor simple, and there is still no guarantee that we will succeed in
forging a consensus bill this year. All I can promise is my best effort
working directly with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to get
there.
And The Winner Is...
More than 60 entries were submitted for the 15th District Congressional
Art Competition. They were on display last weekend at Eastern Illinois
University's Tarble Arts Center. Judging was done by the Coles County
Arts Council, which selected Ruled By News, a photo creation by
Westville High School's Rachel Tison, as the winner. It will be
displayed in our nation's capital for a year, and Rachel receives a
free flight to a ceremony in Washington, DC, honoring the best high
school artists from each Congressional district.

Dear

Thank
you
for

updates.
I
appreciate
your

Speaker Establishing
Select
Committee
To
Investigate
Benghazi
Speaker
John
Boehner
(R,
Ohio-8) announced
Friday
that
he
intends
for
the
House
of
Representatives
to
vote
for
the creation
of a
new
select
committee
to
investigate
the
September
11,
2012,
terrorist
attack
in
Benghazi,
Libya
that
killed
four
Americans.
John
Boehner I
support
the
move
by
the
speaker,
who
stated, &#8220;Americans
learned
this
week
that
the
Obama
Administration
is
so
intent
on
obstructing
the
truth
about
Benghazi
that
it
is
even
willing
to
defy
subpoenas
issued
by
the
standing
committees
of
the
People's
House.
These
revelations
compel
the
House
to
take
every
possible
action
to
ensure
the
American
people
have
the
truth
about
the
terrorist
attack
on
our
consulate
that
killed
four
of
our
countrymen.
In
light
of
these
new
developments,
the
House
will
vote
to
establish
a
new
select
committee
to
investigate
the
attack,
provide
the
necessary
accountability,
and
ensure
justice
is
finally
served.
&#8220;The
administration's
withholding
of
documents
&#8211;
emails
showing
greater
White
House
involvement
in
misleading
the
American
people
&#8211;
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
trust
and
undermines
the
basic
principles
of
oversight
upon
which
our
system
of
government
is
built. And
it
forces
us
to
ask
the
question,
what
else
about
Benghazi
is
the
Obama
Administration
still
hiding
from
the
American
people?"
Subcommittee
Takes
Another
Crack
At
Chemicals
In
Commerce
Act
My
Subcommittee
on
Environment
and
the
Economy
last
week
continued
its
review
of
draft
legislation
to
reform
the
Toxic
Substances
Control
Act
(TSCA).
The
Chemicals
in
Commerce
Act
(CICA) , which
I
have
authored,
aims
to
improve
public
confidence
in
the
safety
of
chemicals
produced
and
used
in
the
United
States,
and
to
facilitate
interstate
commerce
in
American-made
chemicals
and
the
products
that
contain
them.
The
subcommittee
reviewed
an
initial
draft
of
the
legislation
in
March.
Tuesday,
it
reviewed
an
updated
draft,
which
reflects
changes
from
members
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle,
stakeholders,
and
the
administration.
I
appreciate
all
of
our
committee
colleagues
who
have
put
so
much
time
and
effort
into
this
legislative
effort.
TSCA
reform
is
neither
easy
nor
simple,
and
there
is
still
no
guarantee
that
we
will
succeed
in
forging
a
consensus
bill
this
year.
All
I
can
promise
is
my
best
effort
working
directly
with
my
Republican
and
Democratic colleagues to
get
there.
And
The
Winner
Is... More
than
60
