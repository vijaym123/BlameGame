Dear
Friend,
In the first full week of the new year, I want to take the
opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, fulfilling and prosperous
2014 .
I expect that for all of us this year will bring new
challenges to meet, opportunities to grow and lead, and resolutions to
improve ourselves and our communities.
For me, on a personal
and professional level, 2014
my last year in the House of
Representatives
will be a particularly special time of reflection and hard
work.
Public service has been integral to my life for as long as I
can remember. I was raised to value the honor in public service and
the responsibility of holding the public trust.
Serving in
Congress as a representative of Utah has only strengthened these
beliefs.
Even when I first assumed this office in 2000, I knew that
eventually this time would come and my arc of public service would
have many chapters. It has been a tremendous privilege to serve the
people of Utah and I am resolved, even in my final year as your
representative, that there is no more important work than identifying worthy
challenges and working together toward common goals.
I
take the role of representative seriously and intend to conclude this
chapter of my service to our state in the same way I have always
approached my job.
I am determined that 2014 will be a year of seeking
commonsense solutions, solving problems and getting things done for
Utah.
I hope you will join me in this resolution and please
continue to call on me and my office with ways we can serve you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
