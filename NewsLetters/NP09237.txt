Congressman Lamborn Adds Fourth Veteran to
Staff
5/27/14
As part of his membership in the
brand new Veterans Fellowship Caucus, Congressman Doug Lamborn is proud to
welcome Navy veteran RJ Wolf to his Washington DC office. Mr. Wolf
will assist with the goal of helping bring more veterans to work full
time on Capitol Hill. Mr. Wolf will also bring extensive civilian
experience to Congressman Lamborn's office including time spent with the
Defense Logistics Agency and the University of San Diego Athletic
Department.
This brings the
total military and military spouse presence among the Congressman's staff
to 27%, well above the Congressional staff average of 3%, recently
reported in the Associated Press.
"I am pleased to add RJ Wolf to the list of veterans who work
in my Washington and Colorado offices. In addition to helping bring
fellow veterans to work on Capitol Hill, RJ will assist me with the
research and development of veteran-centered
legislation."
