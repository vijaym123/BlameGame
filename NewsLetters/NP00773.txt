Honoring
Our Local Law Enforcement
Dear Friend,
Last week, we recognized National Police
Week, an annual commemoration leading up to
May 15th, which was coined
Peace Officers Memorial Day
in
1962 by President John F. Kennedy. We owe
much gratitude to our law enforcement
officers at the local, state, and federal
levels, who put themselves in danger on a
daily basis.
There are over 900,000 sworn law
enforcement officers across our great
nation who make tremendous sacrifices each
day to selflessly protect us. While working
in the Commonwealth Attorneys Office
in Pittsylvania County, I had the
opportunity to work closely with a number
of these brave men and women and saw
firsthand their dedication to keeping our
communities safe. Their heroic service to
our local communities across
Virginias Fifth District and this
country is profoundly important, and we are
forever grateful for their commitment to
protect us each and every day.
Last week, the House of Representatives
passed the
National
Blue Alert Act of 2015 , which would
require the Attorney General to establish a
national Blue Alert communications network
to disseminate information about suspects
among law enforcement agencies when a law
enforcement officer is seriously injured or
in danger. Similar to Amber Alerts, these
Blue Alerts will help distribute
time-sensitive information to help quickly
identify and apprehend violent criminals.
This is a major step forward in expanding
the alert system, and reaffirming our
commitment to ensure the safety of those
who risk their lives protecting us. It has
already passed the Senate, and will now go
to the Presidents desk, where it is
expected to be signed into law.
We also passed bills to ensure flags
flown over the Capitol are sent to the
immediate family of public safety officers
who are killed in the line of duty and to
amend the IRS code to exclude certain
compensation received by public safety
officers and their dependents from gross
income. Each of these bipartisan pieces of
legislation had my full support, and I was
pleased to see them pass the House of
Representatives. It is my hope that the
Senate and the President join us in our
support of this legislation. I remain
committed to doing all we can to honor the
men and women who have dedicated their
lives to serving and protecting our
communities.
We remain deeply indebted to our law
enforcement officers for the protection
they provide us. I hope you will join me in
thanking them for their selfless service
and remembering those who have made the
ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
