Friend,
Seventy-five years ago today, the government issued a check to 65-year-old Ida May Fuller, of Ludlow, Vermont.
The check, numbered 00-000-001, was the first Social Security payout.
As the future of Social Security lies in financial uncertainty, the program remains one of the government's biggest successes.
Today, the program's trust funds hold more than $2.7 trillion in special Treasury bonds.
But unless Congress acts, Social Security's disability fund will run out in 2016 and the retirement fund will be emptied in 2034.
In Pennsylvania's 17th district nearly 140,000 retirees, people with disabilities, spouses, and children receive $1.8 billion dollars in benefits.
We must do everything we can to not only secure, but also enhance the Social Security program.
I have fought every day for the last two years to protect Social Security benefits.
When President Obama proposed using chained CPI to determine Social Security cost of living adjustments, I joined my colleagues in urging him to reconsider.
I will always work to ensure that our seniors can rely on Social Security to provide a high quality of life.
Sincerely,
