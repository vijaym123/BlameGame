2014.

Dont wait
any longer, get enrolled so you can get covered.
For questions

Unemployment
Insurance
On December 28th, 1.3 million people
will lose their benefits, over 81,000 people just in Illinois. Making
sure that they can keep their modest benefits should be a priority for
all of us.
When Congress comes back in session, we need to
immediately extend the emergency unemployment insurance because not extending
them will harm both families and local economies, and result in the
loss of more than 200,000 jobs.

Safe Toys and Gifts Month
This month is Safe Toys and Gifts Month and I will
countinue to work to protect families and all consumers from hazardous
products.
As we celebrate this holiday season, don't forget that
to check all toys and other gifts are safe products.
This year
we have seen product recalls for toys with toxic chemicals like lead,
products with small parts that are a choking hazard, and products that
can result in a loss of hearing.
Please be safe when buying any
toys and gifts this season.

Sincerely,
Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky
Member of
Congress
