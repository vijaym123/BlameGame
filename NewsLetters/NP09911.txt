Dear Friends,
Mothers
Day is around the corner, and while for us mothers a card, a call, or
a visit are always welcome, it is also worth reflecting on the true
meaning of this special day. This upcoming Sunday let us take the
opportunity to honor all the amazing mothers in our lives and think of how
their passion and drive have influenced us, our communities and
society. Mothers are superheroines. In the home they are our teachers,
biggest fans, friends, and also our first responders to bumps, scrapes,
bruised egos and hurt feelings. But let us not forget that according to
the Department of Labor, almost 60% of our workforce are women and of
those women, over 70% are mothers with children under the age of
18.
On Mothers Day, I will recall my own mother with the fondest
of memories. My mother was not only a loving wife, and a comfort to my
brother and me, but was a friend to all those she met. She had a
wonderful and positive personality that would brighten any room she walked
into, especially with her clever Cuban sayings. After escaping the
brutal regime in Cuba, my mother was determined to succeed and secure a
bright future for her children in the United States of America. She
worked at a hotel cafeteria in Miami Beach, and both she and my father
instilled in me a strong work ethic. They taught me to pursue my beliefs
and passionately serve others.
Even though my mother is no
longer with us, she continues to be my role model and the wind beneath
my wings. As a Member of Congress, I look to her example as I work
for my fellow South Floridians and continue to fight for democracy and
human rights of people throughout the globe.
Let us
honor and remember all the women in our lives who have cared for and
loved us, believed in our callings, and pushed us to be the best we can
be. Thank you to all the mothers and grandmothers who have impacted our
lives in more ways than we can ever express. Feliz Da de las
Madres!
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
