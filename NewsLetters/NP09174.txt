Sunday, Congressman Lipinski
joined by Senator Kirk, will be hosting a listen session with area
veterans to discuss the VA misconduct and to allow veterans to share their
experiences with the state's veteran
hospitals.
The mistreatment of
some veterans by the VA has been shameful. The resignation of Secretary
Shinseki is a first step in cleaning up the system, but much more
needs to be done to assure veterans of the treatment they deserve and to
hold those responsible for neglect of veterans accountable. This will
require reviews of all VA facilities. If you have suffered problems at
Hines or any other VA facility please come forward and tell your
story so you can help up fix the
VA."
