Rubio Delivers Address On Middle
Class Economic Challenges
On Wednesday, Marco outlined reform
conservative ideas to address the rising
cost of living plaguing middle class
families, single parents and young
college graduates during a speech in
Washington, DC. Marco highlighted ways
his policy proposals from this year would
impact his constituents. The speech drew
from real life examples in his home state
of Florida. An excerpt from the speech is
available below.
Our success will not be
measured simply by the size of our
economy or the performance of our
stocks. Rather, it will depend on
whether Americans like Kristeen,
Jennifer, Evan and the Broyles family
will get the real chance to earn for
themselves a better life; on whether
the American Dream becomes possible for
them the way it has been for so many
before.
This is the standard by which
we will be judged. And it should be,
for being the land of equal opportunity
is what sets us apart from all the
nations on the earth. The great
cause of our time is to reclaim the
American Dream for more of our people
than ever before. And in doing so leave
for our children what our parents left
for us: the single greatest nation the
world has ever known.

Rubio Delivers Remarks At
House-Senate Conference Committee On VA
Reform Bill
On Tuesday, Marco
delivered
remarks
at the opening meeting of the
House-Senate conference committee that
was created to reconcile different
versions of Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) reform legislation recently
passed by both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate.
Although he is not a member of the
Senate Committee on Veterans
Affairs, Rubio was asked to be part of
the conference committee due to his
leadership in sponsoring the
VA
Management Accountability Act of
2014 , which passed the House in May
and was included in the Senate-passed VA
reform legislation earlier this month.
This measure would give the VA secretary
the authority to fire or demote VA Senior
Executive Service (SES) or equivalent
employees based on performance. An
excerpt of his remarks is available
below.
Rubio: Reforming the VA is
long overdue. The truth is that it
shouldn't have taken all these problems
reaching the scandalous levels for
Washington to finally wake up and act.
But here we are now with an opportunity
to act. So lets do it. Our
veterans have waited long
enough.

Rubio On Venezuela Sanctions
Legislation: Lets Get This
Done
On Thursday, Marco delivered a Senate
floor speech calling on the Senate to
pass legislation sanctioning human rights
violators in Venezuela. An excerpt of the
speech is available below.
Rubio: So were going
to try to get this done one more time
through unanimous approval, and
were going to work over the next
10 days to hopefully get
everyones support. But if we
cannot do it that way, I hope we can
schedule a vote on the Senate floor on
this bill so we can go after and
sanction those criminals in Venezuela
who are stealing the money of the
Venezuelan people, and using the
strength and the power of that
government to attack their own
people.

Rubio Outlines Next Steps To Deal
With ISIS In Iraq
In
an
op-ed for CNN.com , Marco laid out
steps the U.S. should take to stop ISIS
terrorists and protect U.S. interests. An
excerpt of the piece is below:
So, what should we do?
First and foremost, we need to move
now to degrade ISISs
capabilities. The Presidents
decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq
is a good first step, but their ability
to deter ISIS will be limited unless we
eventually engage in airstrikes to
target their leaders as well as the
supply lines that they use to transfer
weapons and fighters between Syria and
Iraq. We know where these supply lines
are, we should not hesitate to halt the
ISIS resupply to their strongholds in
Anbar, Ninawa and Salah ad-Din.
Second, we also need to understand
that our lack of an effective Syria
strategy has allowed ISIS to take hold
and flourish in the region.
ISIS has been able to develop its
capabilities, increase its ranks, and
obtain combat experience for its
fighters over the last 18 months in
northern Syria.
We need to begin to tackle the root
causes of the problem in Syria by
overtly arming the moderate Syrian
rebels that are fighting ISIS in that
country even as we simultaneously
tackle the challenge they currently
pose to Iraq.

Constituent Casework Corner
Carols brother is a disabled
veteran, so she met with representatives
of the Veterans Administration (VA) to be
appointed his fiduciary guardian.

failed to receive his payments for

Rubios office for assistance to
recoup the delayed payments. A member of
the staff contacted the VA on behalf of
the family. After a thorough
investigation, her approval was confirmed
and the payments were released. Carol
received a retroactive check in the
amount of $10,270.
