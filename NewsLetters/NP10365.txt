ABLE Act gaining traction
The Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE Act), legislation to
create tax free savings accounts for individuals with disabilities,
continues to gain support in Congress. I thought you might be
interested in reading an article from the April 22 edition of the
Washington Post that spells out where this bill stands. You can also go
to my official website at www.crenshaw.house.gov
to learn more about the legislation I wrote so that
individuals with disabilities would have the same financial planning
tools available to other Americans.
How Medicaid forces the disabled to be poor (but some bipartisan help
is on the way)
BY HAROLD POLLACK - Washington Post
Imagine that you are a young woman expecting your first child. Then you
get into an awful crash that leaves you in a wheelchair. Or imagine
that you suffer a high school wrestling injury that results in
quadriplegia. Or imagine that you are intellectually disabled or living
with severe mental illness, and you require long-term services and
supports. If you have been reading my work, you might do more than
imagine, since each of these stories involves real people who have
experienced the best and the worst of what our American medical welfare
state offers.
Medicaid plays a crucial role in each story. Of course the program has
familiar shortcomings. Long-standing administrative challenges,
ideological polarization over health reform perpetuate these
difficulties. So does our nation's tenuous commitment to the well-being
of disadvantaged citizens.
On occasion, though, disability policy provides a welcome exception to
this depressing pattern. Going back to the 1950s, liberal Democrats,
conservative Republicans, and others in-between have made essential
contributions, helping millions of people live happier, more
productive, and fuller lives. My family is certainly quite grateful for
the help provided to my brother-in-law Vincent, who requires a variety
of Medicaid-financed services to address his Fragile X syndrome.
Medicaid is essential in his life, and in the lives of 8.8 million
other non-elderly Americans who live with significant disabilities.
Medicaid does have one huge flaw, which hurts millions of people living
with disabilities, injuries, or chronic illness. You have to live,
officially at least, as a pauper. With important variations across the
states, most recipients are forbidden from having more than two or
three thousand dollars in the bank.
You can generally keep your house or your car. That's pretty much it.
You can't have that emergency fund on hand in case the muffler or the
furnace breaks. And what about the stuff Medicaid doesn't cover? It's
nice to get your teeth cleaned or just to buy a Big Mac every once in
awhile. Because of such means-testing, that new mother is forbidden
from setting any money aside for her child's education. That food
services worker living with intellectual disabilities can't save up for
a nice vacation.
Then there's retirement. As Joe Entwisle put things:
"The reality for someone in my situation is that retirement usually
isn't an option. You work until you die, literally. A friend of mine is
a perfect example. It's almost creepy the similarities in our life.
Both of us had a spinal cord injury at 16. Both of us were injured
wrestling. Both of us are policy analysts. He's a really good guy. He's
63 years old. He started working for the state many years ago. Yet
because of the odd rules around Medicaid eligibility and the
differential treatment of earned and unearned income, he literally
cannot retire. He knows he has to work until he's dead or until some
rules change. As soon as he starts to draw [retirement income], he's
not going to be eligible for health-care programs or he'll have to
spend down to essentially $710 a month. He could no longer afford his
house. He could no longer afford even the taxes on the house."
The current system has other problems, too. First, there is the ironic
class bias that so often accompanies complicated rules. If your
caregiver happens to be a University of Chicago professor, you have
access to skilled lawyers who can draw up the proper wills and special
needs trusts to side-step many official requirements.
Families with less financial or social capital often go without. Others
dangerously improvise. Maybe an octogenarian parent leaves all of her
money to her oldest son, with an implicit understanding that he'll use
half of these funds for his younger sister. Suppose he gets divorced or
misuses the money? How many other ways can this go wrong?
Means-testing encourages families to cut corners. Worse, it hinders
precisely the long-term planning that every person with a disability
and every family should do.
These requirements seem especially strange in the wake of health
reform. If you're on Medicaid because you had a spinal cord injury, you
face punishing limitations on your allowable financial assets. If you
qualify for Medicaid on the basis of low-income, you don't face the
same limitations. There's no real justification for this inconsistency.
Its one virtue may be that it could prove politically generative, in
promoting beneficial reforms. It's hard to believe that the disability
community or the American public will long tolerate this discrepancy.
Things are already beginning to move.
The Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act of 2013 provides one
example. The ABLE Act was introduced last year, and it's on the
legislative agenda again this year. Identical versions are co-sponsored
by seventy senators and by 359 members of the House. Pennsylvania
Democrat Robert Casey, Jr. and his Republican counterpart Richard Burr
introduced the Senate bill. Representatives Ander Crenshaw, Chris Van
Hollen, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and Pete Sessions introduced the
counterpart House bill. It's amazing to see Senators Bernie Sanders,
Jay Rockefeller, Mitch McConnell, and James Imhofe co-sponsoring the
same bill.
John Rizzo, press secretary to Senator Casey, told me that he
anticipates a vote in the coming weeks. Sponsors are waiting for the
Congressional Budget Office to issue a budget score. Once that happens,
Rizzo is optimistic that the bill can become law in the next few months.
I'm sure ABLE accounts will bring some complicated financial mechanics,
but the concept behind them is simple. These allow people living with
disabilities to establish accounts similar to the 529 educational
accounts that many of us have established for our kids. The balance of
these ABLE accounts, and their investment returns, can be used for
educational expenses, housing, transportation, assistive technologies,
and other basic needs.
For many people, this reduces the need for complicated record-keeping
and paperwork. It's cheaper and easier than the complicated special
needs trusts many of us have spent thousands of dollars to create and
manage. It provides tax advantages. It legitimates what families are
often already doing in less transparent and efficient ways. It doesn't
address retirement and some other key issues, but it's very helpful.
It's hard to oppose that, wherever you reside on the political
spectrum. As Senator Robert Casey put things over email:
"The best advocates for this bill are the people who are dealing with
these challenges like Sara Wolff of Northeastern Pennsylvania. When
people like Ms. Wolff, who has Down syndrome, talk about the challenges
they face and the dreams they have for their lives it inspires action.
Further, Democrats and Republicans have rallied behind the ABLE Act
because it is a commonsense approach that uses a proven model--the 529
account."
The decidedly middle-class shading helps to explain this bill's broad
support. The engineer whose youngest son lives with Down syndrome
immediately sees the value of an account like this. She also has the
cash to put in it.
ABLE accounts are less useful to some of my brother-in-law's peers.
Some come from very poor families. For others, ABLE accounts just come
too late. They have outlived their intimate caregivers or at least
these relationships. Many live entirely on federal disability benefits
and nutrition assistance. Under typical terms in many settings, almost
all of these benefits are signed over to the group homes and other
facilities in which they live. Residents get to keep $50 per month for
all of their discretionary expenses from dental visits to the
occasional tee shirt, movie ticket, or McDonald's hamburger.
Here in Illinois, 23,000 children and adults are somewhere on the long
waiting list for in-home services, residential placement and other
services. These families require more generous benefits more than they
need 529-style accounts. And that's a heavier financial and political
lift. Others live in states with other difficulties. Rizzo notes that
Senator Casey has encouraged Pennsylvania to embrace the Affordable
Care Act's Medicaid expansion to address poverty-related issues more
effectively.
Although more remains to be done, the ABLE Act promises to be a humane
and valuable contribution to public policy. In an era disfigured by
mean-spirited and polarized gridlock politics, this is no little thing.
Thank You Northeast Florida Community Hospice!
Susan Ponder Stansel, President and CEO of the Northeast Florida
Community Hospice, presents me with the organization's Community
Service Award on Thursday at the University of North Florida Adam
Hebert University Center. Thanks, but I have to say that the work they
do day in and day out deserves the spotlight.

How

(but

BY
HAROLD
POLLACK
-
Washington
Post
Imagine
that
you
are
a
young
woman
expecting
your
first
child.
Then
you
get
into
an
awful
crash
that
leaves
you
in
a
wheelchair.
Or
imagine
that
you
suffer
a
high
school
wrestling
injury
that
results
in
quadriplegia.
Or
imagine
that
you
are
intellectually
disabled
or
living
with
severe
mental
illness,
and
you
require
long-term
services
and
supports.
If
you
have
been
reading
my

you
might
do
more
than

since
each
of
these
stories
involves
real
people
who
have

the
best
and
the

of
what
our
American
medical
welfare
state

Medicaid
plays
a
crucial
role
in
each
story.
Of
course
the
program
has
familiar
shortcomings.
Long-standing
administrative

ideological

these

So
does
our

to

On

though,
disability

provides
a

Going

Republicans,
and
others
in-between
have
made
essential

helping
millions
of
people
live
happier,
more
productive,
and
fuller
lives.
My
family
is
certainly
quite
grateful
for
the
help
provided
to
my
brother-in-law
Vincent,
who
requires
a
variety
of
Medicaid-financed
services
to
address
his
Fragile
X
syndrome.
Medicaid
is
essential
in
his
life,
and
in
the
lives
of
8.8
million
other
non-elderly
Americans
who
live
with
significant
disabilities.
Medicaid
does
have
one
huge
flaw,
which
hurts
millions
of
people
living
with
disabilities,
injuries,
or
chronic
illness.
You
have
to
live,
officially
at
least,
as
a
pauper.
With
important
variations
across
the
states,
most
recipients
are
forbidden
from
having
more
than
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank.
You
can
generally
keep
your
house
or
your
car.
That&#8217;s
pretty
much
it.
You
can&#8217;t
have
that
emergency
fund
on
hand
in
case
the
muffler
or
the
furnace
breaks.
And
what
about
the
stuff
Medicaid
doesn't
cover?
It&#8217;s
nice
to
get
your
teeth
cleaned
or
just
to
buy
a
Big
Mac
every
once
in
awhile.
Because
of
such
means-testing,
that
new
mother
is
forbidden
from
setting
any
money
aside
for
her
child&#8217;s
education.
That
food
services
worker
living
with
intellectual
disabilities
can&#8217;t
save
up
for
a
nice
vacation.
Then
there&#8217;s
retirement.
As
Joe
Entwisle
put
things:
"The
reality
for
someone
in
my
situation
is
that
retirement
usually
isn&#8217;t
an
option.
You
work
until
you
die,
literally.
A
friend
of
mine
is
a
perfect
example.
It&#8217;s
almost
creepy
the
similarities
in
our
life.
Both
of
us
had
a
spinal
cord
injury
at
16.
Both
of
us
were
injured
wrestling.
Both
of
us
are
policy
analysts.
He&#8217;s
a
really
good
guy.
He&#8217;s
63
years
old.
He
started
working
for
the
state
many
years
ago.
Yet
because
of
the
odd
rules
around
Medicaid
eligibility
and
the
differential
treatment
of
earned
and
unearned
income,
he
literally
cannot
retire.
He
knows
he
has
to
work
until
he&#8217;s
dead
or
until
some
rules
change.
As
soon
as
he
starts
to
draw
[retirement
income],
he&#8217;s
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
health-care
programs
or
he&#8217;ll
have
to
spend
down
to
essentially
$710
a
month.
He
could
no
longer
afford
his
house.
He
could
no
longer
afford
even
the
taxes
on
the
house."
The
current
system
has
other
problems,
too.
First,
there
is
the
ironic
class
bias
that
so
often
accompanies
complicated
rules.
If
your
caregiver
happens
to
be
a
University
of
Chicago
professor,
you
have
access
to
skilled
lawyers
who
can
draw
up
the
proper
wills
and
special
needs
trusts
to
side-step
many
official
requirements.
Families
with
less
financial
or
social
capital
often
go
without.
Others
dangerously
improvise.
Maybe
an
octogenarian
parent
leaves
all
of
her
money
to
her
oldest
son,
with
an
implicit
understanding
that
he&#8217;ll
use
half
of
these
funds
for
his
younger
sister.
Suppose
he
gets
divorced
or
misuses
the
money?
How
many
other
ways
can
this
go
wrong?
Means-testing
encourages
families
to
cut
corners.
Worse,
it
hinders
precisely
the
long-term
planning
that
every
person
with
a
disability
and
every
family
should
do.
These
requirements
seem
especially
strange
in
the
wake
of
health
reform.
If
you&#8217;re
on
Medicaid
because
you
had
a
spinal
cord
injury,
you
face
punishing
limitations
on
your
allowable
financial
assets.
If
you
qualify
for
Medicaid
on
the
basis
of
low-income,
you
don&#8217;t
face
the
same
limitations.
There&#8217;s
no
real
justification
for
this
inconsistency.
Its
one
virtue
may
be
that
it
could
prove
politically
generative,
in
promoting
beneficial
reforms.
It&#8217;s
hard
to
believe
that
the
disability
community
or
the
American
public
will
long
tolerate
this
discrepancy.
Things
are
already
beginning
to
move.
The
Achieving
a
Better
Life
Experience
(ABLE)
Act
of
2013
provides
one
example.
The
ABLE
Act
was
introduced
last
year,
and
it&#8217;s
on
the
legislative
agenda
again
this
year.
Identical
versions
are
co-sponsored
by
seventy
senators
and
by
359
members
of
the
House.
Pennsylvania
Democrat
Robert
Casey,
Jr.
and
his
Republican
counterpart
Richard
Burr
introduced
the
Senate
bill.
Representatives
Ander
Crenshaw,
Chris
Van
Hollen,
Cathy
McMorris
Rodgers,
and
Pete
Sessions
introduced
the
counterpart
House
bill.
It&#8217;s
amazing
to
see
Senators
Bernie
Sanders,
Jay
Rockefeller,
Mitch
McConnell,
and
James
Imhofe
co-sponsoring
the
same
bill.
John
Rizzo,
press
secretary
to
Senator
Casey,
told
me
that
he
anticipates
a
vote
in
the
coming
weeks.
Sponsors
are
waiting
for
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
to
issue
a
budget
score.
Once
that
happens,
Rizzo
is
optimistic
that
the
bill
can
become
law
in
the
next
few
months.
I&#8217;m
sure
ABLE
accounts
will
bring
some
complicated
financial
mechanics,
but
the
concept
behind
them
is
simple.
These
allow
people
living
with
disabilities
to
establish
accounts
similar
to
the
529
educational
accounts
that
many
of
us
have
established
for
our
kids.
The
balance
of
these
ABLE
accounts,
and
their
investment
returns,
can
be
used
for
educational
expenses,
housing,
transportation,
assistive
technologies,
and
other
basic
needs.
For
many
people,
this
reduces
the
need
for
complicated
record-keeping
and
paperwork.
It&#8217;s
cheaper
and
easier
than
the
complicated
special
needs
trusts
many
of
us
have
spent
thousands
of
dollars
to
create
and
manage.
It
provides
tax
advantages.
It
legitimates
what
families
are
often
already
doing
in
less
transparent
and
efficient
ways.
It
doesn&#8217;t
address
retirement
and
some
other
key
issues,
but
it&#8217;s
very
helpful.
It&#8217;s
hard
to
oppose
that,
wherever
you
reside
on
the
political
spectrum.
As
Senator
Robert
Casey
put
things
over
email:
"The
best
advocates
for
this
bill
are
the
people
who
are
dealing
with
these
challenges
like
Sara
Wolff
of
Northeastern
Pennsylvania.
When
people
like
Ms.
Wolff,
who
has
Down
syndrome,
talk
about
the
challenges
they
face
and
the
dreams
they
have
for
their
lives
it
inspires
action.
Further,
Democrats
and
Republicans
have
rallied
behind
the
ABLE
Act
because
it
is
a
commonsense
approach
that
uses
a
proven
model--the
529
account."
The
decidedly
middle-class
shading
helps
to
explain
this
bill&#8217;s
broad
support.
The
engineer
whose
youngest
son
lives
with
Down
syndrome
immediately
sees
the
value
of
an
account
like
this.
She
also
has
the
cash
to
put
in
it.
ABLE
accounts
are
less
useful
to
some
of
my
brother-in-law&#8217;s
peers.
Some
come
from
very
poor
families.
For
others,
ABLE
accounts
just
come
too
late.
They
have
outlived
their
intimate
caregivers
or
at
least
these
relationships.
Many
live
entirely
on
federal
disability
benefits
and
nutrition
assistance.
Under
typical
terms
in
many
settings,
almost
all
of
these
benefits
are
signed
over
to
the
group
homes
and
other
facilities
in
which
they
live.
Residents
get
to
keep
$50
per
month
for
all
of
their
discretionary
expenses
from
dental
visits
to
the
occasional
tee
shirt,
movie
ticket,
or
McDonald&#8217;s
hamburger.
Here
in
Illinois,
23,000
children
and
adults
are
somewhere
on
the
long
waiting
list
for
in-home
services,
residential
placement
and
other
services.
These
families
require
more
generous
benefits
more
than
they
need
529-style
accounts.
And
that&#8217;s
a
heavier
financial
and
political
lift.
Others
live
in
states
with
other
difficulties.
Rizzo
notes
that
Senator
Casey
has
encouraged
Pennsylvania
to
embrace
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
Medicaid
expansion
to
address
poverty-related
issues
more
effectively.
Although
more
remains
to
be
done,
the
ABLE
Act
promises
to
be
a
humane
and
valuable
contribution
to
public
policy.
In
an
era
disfigured
by
mean-spirited
and
polarized
gridlock
politics,
this
is
no
little
thing.
