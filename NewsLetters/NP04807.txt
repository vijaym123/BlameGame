Dear David,
Rochester has a long, proud history of rail travel, but we
havent lived up to that promise over the last several decades.
For Rochester, for the nearly 150,000
people who use this station every year, for the college students
flooding our city to go to our great colleges and universities, for the deaf
and hard of hearing community, for the people in our community who use
wheelchairs, and even for babies in strollers, we have not lived up
to the promise of rail.
With no
air service between Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse, and Albany, our
economy relies on rail travel, and our current station has not served
us well. We have suffered from our inability to safely, quickly, and
reliably move from one city to the other.
Well, thats
about to change.
After three
decades of a temporary station,
we have broken ground for the new
station!

more photos from the event, click

Over the years, this project has
been stymied by lack of funding. Im proud to have secured the targeted
federal investment to make this transformative project
possible. That money will go solely to building this train station and Im
pleased to see that all levels of our government have worked together to
secure the full cost of Phase One of this project and support the 200
local jobs that will be created.
The first rail station
that stood on this ground opened its doors in 1914, a hundred years ago.
It was a paragon of design. Brought to life by architect Claud
Fayette Bragdon, that station was, as one traveler put it, quote, sheer
beauty in its grace, as well as a structural achievement of the time. A
traveler arriving in the home city of George Eastman and his Kodak
(camera) knew he had indeed
arrived . That magnificent
building was indeed Rochester.
In
Claud Bragdons autobiography, he wrote about how difficult it was for
him to design our station. To inspire himself, he walked the tracks,
back and forth, back and forth. He watched the trains go by and
suddenly, he, quote, felt them.
The driving wheels of the locomotive
he envisioned in that moment were integrated throughout our station.
The new design is an homage to that building, to that era, and to
Bragdon.
It will stand here soon enough and will be a testament
to the beauty and grace of Bragdons original design. Its fitting
that 100 years later, if we cant have his station, well have one
inspired by it.
I cant wait to
take a ride out of that new station!
Best,
Louise
