Click here to denounce Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s frivolous lawsuit against President Obama &gt;&gt;
Boehner&rsquo;s using taxpayer dollars to file a baseless lawsuit against President Obama. Instead of focusing on issues that matter to everyday Americans, House Republicans are trying to score political points. David, sign our petition to denounce Boehner&rsquo;s baseless lawsuit.
David, let&rsquo;s be clear about something:
House Republicans are using your tax dollars to file a lawsuit against President Obama.
Rather than working together to try and accomplish something -- anything -- Speaker Boehner's using your hard earned money to play politics.
David, I won&rsquo;t stand for this nonsense and you shouldn&rsquo;t either. Sign your name to denounce Boehner&rsquo;s baseless lawsuit &gt;&gt;
There&rsquo;s so much important to work yet to be done; so many important issues we still need to address.
Instead, Republicans in Congress are trying to score political points.
David, please sign your name and denounce this baseless lawsuit for what it is, a giant waste of time. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Denounce-Boehner

Brad
