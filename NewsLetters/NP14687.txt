The 6th District
Reducing Claims Backlog for
Veterans
Dear
Friends:
During my time serving on the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, I have been witness to a strong bipartisanship
and dedication to get positive results for our veterans.
All of us
on the Committee share the desire to serve our veterans and do
everything we can to help the VA operate more efficiently and effectively.
I am pleased
to report this desire goes beyond the Veterans Affairs Committee and
is present in the entire House of Representatives.
Earlier this
year, I along with over 150 Members of the House sent a
letter
to the President urging his immediate
action to reduce the VA
backlog.
This week, the House again showed its unity
by passing H.R. 2189.
This bill will aid the VA by establishing
a task force (a recommendation by the Government Accountability
Office) to evaluate the backlog of veterans' disability claims, ensuring the
VA will find innovative ways to reduce the
backlog.
For years, the
disability compensation claims process has been the subject of concern and
attention by VA, Congress, and multiple Veterans Service Organizations,
due in large part to long waits and the large number of claims pending a
decision.
In fact, VAs backlog of claims, defined as claims
awaiting a decision for over 125 days, has more than tripled since
September 2009.
Currently, there are over 400,000 claims in this
category.
Although there has been some progress recently, the pace
is still too slow for many veterans waiting for their claims to be
processed and is a concern particularly for the thousands of veterans
returning from overseas in the near
future.
As a Marine Corps Combat
veteran, it was imperative that I join my colleagues on the Veterans
Affairs Committee on the House
Floor
to urge for the passage of HR 2189.
There are nearly 400,000
veterans in Colorado, and these men and women need Washington to step up
and help the VA reduce the
backlog.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S.
Representative

climbing!

The Ground
Report
Published:
October 29, 2013
On October 28, 2013, Rep.
Mike
Coffman
of Colorado asked for permission to address the United States
House of Representatives for one minute regarding the national
debt.
Mr. Speaker, on January 20, 2009, the day President
Obama took office, the national debt was
$10,626,877,048,913.08.
Today, it is $17,087,891,889,205.15. Weve added
$6,461,014,840,292.07 to our debt in 4 years. This is $5 trillion in debt our nation,
our economy, and our children could have avoided with a balanced budget
amendment, said Rep.
Coffman.
The estimated
population of the United States is 316,942,124, so each citizens share of
this debt is $53,911.19.
The National Debt has continued
to increase an average of $2.59 billion per day, according to the U.S.
National Debt clock. (Source:

Medicare Open Enrollment
Medicares open
enrollment period is currently underway. From October 15 - December 7, all
Medicare beneficiaries are encouraged to review their current health and
prescription drug coverage, including any changes in costs, coverage
or benefits that will take effect in 2014. If you want to change your
coverage for 2014, you must complete those changes by December 7, 2013.
If you are satisfied with your current coverage and feel it will be
sufficient to meet your needs in 2014, you dont need to do
anything.
Please bear in
mind that the Medicare open enrollment period is a time when there is
a higher risk of fraudulent activities. To learn more about health
care fraud and ways to protect against it, visit
www.StopMedicareFraud.gov
or contact Colorados Senior
Medicare Patrol (SMP) office at
1-800-503-5190.
There have been some questions about
the implications of the new Health Insurance Marketplace - also known
as Obamacare. Please note that Medicare is NOT part of the
Marketplace program. If you currently have Medicare you should NOT enroll in the
Marketplace. Further, it is against the law for someone who knows
that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan. If you are not on
Medicare, and are not able to obtain health coverage, please visit
connectforhealthco.com .
The Centers for Medicare
&amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has assured beneficiaries that the
Health Insurance Marketplace will not affect current beneficiaries
coverage. In a statement, CMS said: No matter how you get Medicare, whether
through Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO
or PPO), you will still have the same benefits and security you have
now, and you wont have to make any
changes.
