Friend,
Once more - thank you. You took John Boehner&#39;s visit as seriously as we did, and helped us hit our emergency fund goal. We were able to keep our heads above water these past few days - because of you.
I also wanted to make sure you knew that
tomorrow evening at 7pm, I&#39;ll be engaging in a debate with Doug Ose.
It will air on KVIE, local channel 6, and you can listen to it on Capitol Public Radio, 90.9 FM or
www.capradio.org . To listen online, please

I hope that you&#39;ll be able to tune in as my opponent and I debate the important issues that our district faces -
I believe that the contrasts between us will be made very clear.
Again - thank you.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
