Dear Friend,
For too long,
Citizens United
has empowered wealthy corporate interests at the expense of middle class families. Corporations are
not
people -- and they should not be vested with the same freedom of speech that the Constitution guarantees to individuals. I&rsquo;m joining with several of my colleagues to support measures to end the corrosive effects of
Citizens United
and restore transparency to our campaign finance system. Will you add your name to mine?
Our nation&rsquo;s history is littered with examples of what happens when we allow unchecked corporate money in our elections. When corporate interests are allowed to spend virtually unlimited and untraceable amounts of cash, their pet projects take priority over the issues that matter to the middle class.
Sadly, the Supreme Court ignored the lessons of both history and common sense when it declared that corporations have the same rights to free speech as individuals. It is up to us to repair the damage the Court has done. If you believe that
Citizens United
is harming our democracy, I need you to speak up today. Sign our petition, share it with your friends, and help us create a campaign finance system that works.
Thanks for your support.
