Dear Friends,
As your representative, receiving your input on the issues that matter
to you most is important to me. I appreciate the calls, emails and
letters our offices receive from residents of the 29th District of
Texas every day. Responding to your questions and keeping you informed
remain some of my top priorities, which is why we're improving the way
we return your correspondence.
Starting this month, if you send us an email through our website you
will receive a response via email, however, if you write to us by mail
you will continue to receive a response in the mail. This process will
increase efficiency and ensure that you are responded to as quickly as
possible. If you have any questions, please contact one of our offices
listed below.
This month, we're also proud to be hosting an Affordable Care Act
