While I try not to send too many emails, I did want to highlight the
ongoing Congressional Art Competition for anyone out there who knows a
high school student that might be interested. The Congressional Art
Competition allows one high school artist from each congressional
district to have their work displayed in the US Capitol, and wins a
trip to Washington this summer to see their work.
If you know of any students who may be interested, I'd encourage you to
pass this email along to them. Further details and sign-up information
can be found here
