Kansas Common Sense
December 1, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
This week, Robba and I joined all Kansans in celebrating Thanksgiving
with family and friends, and giving thanks for our blessings. I am
especially grateful for the service and charitable organizations that
support our communities and those in need. I hope you and your families
also enjoy time together and have the chance to reflect on all we have
to be thankful for - both as Kansans and Americans.
Kansas Listening Tour Continues
This week, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with stops in Osage,
Shawnee, Wyandotte, Cloud and Republic Counties. The issues I focus on
and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely based on the
conversations I have with Kansans. You can find upcoming Kansas
Listening Tour stops in your community on my website
.
On Monday, about 40 Osage County residents joined me at the Overbrook
Public Library to share feedback on a number of issues facing our
country, including reform at the Department of Veterans Affairs,
education and investment in infrastructure. Residents also shared their
concerns about the President's use of Executive Orders to push his
agenda around Congress, and the need for accountability at the EPA and
other federal agencies. Thanks to Osage County commissioners, Gaylord
Anderson and Kenneth Kuykendall for sharing concerns about the PILOT
program and its effect in Osage County. Thanks also to former state
Representative Willie Prescott who continues to serve our state as a
liaison for Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Finally, thank you to
library director Gaylen Worthington for helping arrange my town hall
meeting.
On Monday afternoon, Rep. Lynn Jenkins and I held a joint town hall
meeting in Topeka. Nearly 100 Shawnee County residents came out to
discuss a number of issues including the Department of Veterans Affairs
and mental health, the Affordable Care Act and its impact on jobs and
quality of care for Americans, and transportation issues. Thanks to the
concerned citizens who attended. Special thanks to Bartlett & West for
hosting.
Wednesday morning I conducted a Wyandotte County Town Hall at the
Bonner Springs City Library. We discussed immigration, veterans'
affairs, education and government overregulation impacting their
businesses. I appreciated those who took time to stop by and share
their concerns with me. Thanks to Regina Utter with the Bonner Springs
Edwardsville Chamber of Commerce for coordinating the meeting.
On Friday, I hosted town hall meetings in Cloud and Republic Counties.
My first stop was in Clyde at the Senior Center. About 17 Kansans
attended and we had a good discussion about the future of Medicare and
concerns about over-regulation of community banks. Thanks to Sherri
Douglas for opening up the Senior Center to residents for my visit.
I then traveled north to Cuba to hear about residents share their
concerns abouthealth care, the Department of Veterans Affairs,
entrepreneurship and bureaucracy in Washington. The community suffered
a great lost recently with the death of Dale Huncovsky, owner of the
Cuba Cash Store. Hearing stories about Dale reminded me of what I loved
about growing up in rural America - the strong sense of community. I
appreciate folks taking away time from family over the Thanksgiving
holiday to visit with me and share their thoughts.
Enabling Volunteer Physicians to Serve Veterans
Last Thursday, I introduced the Physician Volunteer Ambassadors Helping
Veterans Act to enable volunteer physicians to serve in Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities that are struggling with
appointment wait times or staffing shortages. Qualified physicians
across the country are willing to give their time and expertise to help
alleviate the long waits for veterans at many of the VA medical
facilities entrusted with providing care for our nation's heroes.
Though VA possesses the authority to allow physician volunteers to work
in its VA medical facilities, bureaucratic red tape often prevents many
physicians from volunteering their services. The Physician Volunteer
Ambassadors Helping Veterans will make certain that VA uses its
existing authority to support qualified physician volunteers from local
communities who would like to dedicate a minimum of 40 volunteer hours
per year. Not only will this allow our medical communities to help
veterans, but it will ease some of the pressure on permanent VA staff,
enabling them to regain their focus on providing quality health care to
our veterans.
Touring St. Francis Pathology Lab
On Monday, I visited St. Francis Health in Topeka to tour the hospital's
full-service clinical laboratory providing diagnostic testing in many
health areas. The lab examines organs, tissues and other specimens to
make a diagnosis of disease. All tests are performed upon the written
order of a licensed health care provider, and a pathologist is
available for consultation 24 hours a day. St. Francis Health also
operates an offsite lab in Topeka for patient convenience. Thanks again
to pathologist Dr. Richard Gomez for inviting me and giving me such an
informative tour.
Honoring the Simons Family in Lawrence
Also on Monday, I enjoyed attending a surprise unveiling of a bronze
sculpture of The World Company Chairman and Lawrence Journal-World
Editor Dolph C. Simons Jr. (pictured below on the far right), and his
father the late Dolph Simons Sr. The bust was created to honor the two
newspapermen for their contributions in journalism and for their
support to The University of Kansas. The sculpture was commissioned by
former Kansas Board of Regents Chairman Clay Blair and will be
displayed at the KU Alumni Center.
Presidential historian and founding director of Kansas University's
Dole Institute of Politics Richard Norton Smith (pictured below in the
middle) referred to the sculpture as "twin likenesses that commemorate
over a century of service to a great university and the town from which
it derives no small part of its identity."
Kansas City Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner
On Tuesday evening Robba and I attended the Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce Annual Dinner. The theme of the evening was how large Kansas
City companies got their start as well as new companies forming because
of the community's entrepreneurial spirit. They honored outgoing
Chamber Chair Roshann Parris of Parris Communications and incoming
Chair Terry Dunn of JE Dunn Construction. Congratulations to University
of Missouri-Kansas City Chancellor Leo Morton who was named the Kansas
Citian of the Year. The keynote address was given by Daymond John,
founder and CEO of For Us By Us (FUBU), a global brand of clothing and
accessories and his consulting company Shark Branding. Daymond shared
his experiences and encouraged the audience to empower themselves to
make positive changes in their entrepreneurial careers. Thanks to Russ
Welsh with Polsinelli for hosting Robba and me.
Attending the Sunflower Showdown
On Saturday, I attended the football game pitting KU against K-State in
Manhattan. The series between these schools has been played every year
since 1911, making it one of the longest running annual rivalries in
college football. While K-State has dominated recently, KU leads the
series 65-42-5.? The winner of this year's Governor's Cup was K-State
by a score of 51-13. Congratulations to Coach Bill Snyder and his
Wildcats. Special thanks to K-State President Kirk Schultz and KU
Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little for hosting me.

Kansas
Listening
Tour
Continues This
week,
I
continued
my
Kansas
Listening
Tour
with
stops
in
Osage,
Shawnee,
Wyandotte,
Cloud
and
Republic
Counties.
The
issues
I
focus
on
and
work
I
do
in
Washington,
D.C.,
are
largely
based
on
the
conversations
I
have
with
Kansans.
You
can find
upcoming
Kansas

On
Monday,
about
40
Osage
County
residents
joined
me
at
the
Overbrook
Public
Library
to
share
feedback
on
a
number
of
issues
facing
our
country,
including
reform
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs,
education
and
investment
in
infrastructure.
Residents
also
shared
their
concerns
about
the
President&#8217;s
use
of
Executive
Orders
to
push
his
agenda
around
Congress,
and
the
need
for
accountability
at
the

and
its

On
Monday
afternoon,
Rep.
Lynn
Jenkins
and
I
held
a
joint
town
hall
meeting
in
Topeka.
Nearly
100
Shawnee
County
residents
came
out
to
discuss
a
number
of
issues
including
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
and
mental
health,
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
its
impact
on
jobs
and
quality
of
care
for
Americans,
and
transportation
issues.
Thanks
to
the
concerned
citizens
who
attended.
Special
thanks
to
Bartlett
&amp;
West
for
hosting.
Wednesday
morning
I
conducted
a
Wyandotte
County
Town
Hall
at
the
Bonner
Springs
City
Library.
We
discussed
immigration,
veterans'
affairs,
education
and
government
overregulation
impacting
their
businesses.
I
appreciated
those
who
took
time
to
stop
by
and
share
their
concerns
with
me.
Thanks
to
Regina
Utter
with
the
Bonner
Springs
Edwardsville
Chamber
of
Commerce
for
coordinating
the
meeting.
On
Friday,
I
hosted
town
hall
meetings
in
Cloud
and
Republic
Counties.
My
first
stop
was
in
Clyde
at
the
Senior
Center. About
17
Kansans
attended
and
we
had
a
good
discussion
about
the
future
of
Medicare
and
concerns
about
over-regulation
of
community
banks .
Thanks
to
Sherri
Douglas
for
opening
up
the
Senior
Center
to
residents
for
my
visit.
I
then
traveled
north
to
Cuba
to
hear
about
residents
share
their
concerns
about health
care,
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs,
entrepreneurship
and
bureaucracy
in
Washington.
The
community
suffered
a
great
l ost
recently
with
the
death
of
Dale
Huncovsky,
owner
of
the
Cuba
Cash
Store.
Hearing
stories
about
Dale
reminded
me
of
what
I
loved
about
growing
up
in
rural
America
&#8211;
the
strong
sense
of
community.
I
appreciate
folks
taking
away
time
from
family
over
the
Thanksgiving
holiday
to
visit
with
me
and
share
their
thoughts.
Enabling
Volunteer
Physicians
to
Serve
Veterans
Last
Thursday,
I
introduced
the
Physician
Volunteer
Ambassadors
Helping
Veterans
Act
to
enable
volunteer
physicians
to
serve
in
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
medical
facilities
that
are
struggling
with
appointment
wait
times
or
staffing
shortages.
Qualified
physicians
across
the
country
are
willing
to
give
their
time
and
expertise
to
help
alleviate
the
long
waits
for
veterans
at
many
of
the
VA
medical
facilities
entrusted
with
providing care
for
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes.
Though
VA
possesses
the
authority
to
allow
physician
volunteers
to
work
in
its
VA
medical
facilities,
bureaucratic
red
tape
often
prevents
many
physicians
from
volunteering
their
services.
The
Physician
Volunteer
Ambassadors
Helping
Veterans
will
make
certain
that
VA
uses
its
existing
authority
to
support
qualified
physician
volunteers
from
local
communities
who
would
like
to
dedicate
a
minimum
of
40
volunteer
hours
per
year.
Not
only
will
this
allow
our
medical
communities
to
help
veterans,
but
it
will
ease
some
of
the
pressure
on
permanent
VA
staff,
enabling
them
to
regain
their
focus
on
providing
quality
health
care
to
our
veterans.
Touring
St.
Francis
Pathology
Lab
On
Monday,
I
visited
St.
Francis
Health
in
Topeka
to
tour
the
hospital&#8217;s
full-service
clinical
laboratory
providing
diagnostic
testing
in
many
health
areas.
The
lab
examines
organs,
tissues
and
other
specimens
to
make
a
diagnosis
of
disease.
All
tests
are
performed
upon
the
written
order
of
a
licensed
health
care
provider,
and
a
pathologist
is
available
for
consultation
24
hours
a
day.
St.
Francis
Health
also
operates
an
offsite
lab
in
Topeka
for
patient
convenience.
Thanks
again
to
pathologist
Dr.
Richard
Gomez
for
inviting
me
and
giving
me
such
an
informative
tour.
Honoring
the
Simons
Family
in
Lawrence
Also
on
Monday,
I
enjoyed
attending
a
surprise
unveiling
of
a
bronze
sculpture
of
The
World
Company
Chairman
and
Lawrence
Journal-World
Editor
Dolph
C.
Simons
Jr.
(pictured
below
on
the
far
right),
and
his
father
the
late
Dolph
Simons
Sr.
The
bust
was
created
to
honor
the
two
newspapermen
for
their
contributions
in
journalism
and
for
their
support
to
The
University
of
Kansas.
The
sculpture
was
commissioned
by
former
Kansas
Board
of
Regents
Chairman
Clay
Blair
and
will
be
displayed
at
the
KU
Alumni
Center.
Presidential
historian
and
founding
director
of
Kansas
University&#8217;s
Dole
Institute
of
Politics
Richard
Norton
Smith
(pictured
below
in
the
middle)
referred
to
the
sculpture
as
&#8220;twin
likenesses
that
commemorate
over
a
century
of
service
to
a
great
university
and
the
town
from
which
it
derives
no
small
part
of
its
identity.&#8221;
Kansas
City
Chamber
of
Commerce
Annual

On
Tuesday
evening
Robba
and
I
attended
the
Kansas
City
Chamber
of
Commerce
Annual
Dinner.
The
theme
of
the
evening
was
how
large
Kansas
City
companies
got
their
start
as
well
as
new
companies
forming
because
of
the
community&#8217;s
entrepreneurial
spirit.
They
honored
outgoing
Chamber
Chair
Roshann
Parris
of
Parris
Communications
and
incoming

Terry
Dunn
of
JE
Dunn
Construction.
Congratulations
to
University
of
Missouri-Kansas
City
Chancellor
Leo
Morton
who
was
named
the
Kansas

The
keynote
address
was
given
by
Daymond
John,
founder
and
CEO
of
For
Us
By
Us
(FUBU),
a
global
brand
of
clothing
and
accessories
and
his
consulting
company
Shark
Branding. Daymond
shared
his
experiences
and
encouraged
the
audience
to
empower
themselves
to
make
positive
changes
in
their
entrepreneurial
careers.
Thanks
to
Russ
Welsh
with
Polsinelli
for
hosting
Robba
and
me.
Attending
the
Sunflower
Showdown On
Saturday,
I
attended
the
football
game
pitting
KU
against
K-State
in
Manhattan.
The
series
between
these
schools
has
been
played
every
year
since
1911,
making
it
one
of
the
longest
running
annual
rivalries
in
college
football.
While
K-State
has
dominated
recently,
KU
leads
the
series
65-42-5.&#8206;
The
winner
of
this
year's
Governor's
Cup
was
K-State
by
a
score
of
51-13.
Congratulations
to
Coach
Bill
Snyder
and
his
Wildcats.
Special
thanks
to
K-State
