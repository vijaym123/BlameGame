LEGISLATION
May 10, 2015
Dear David,
On June 1st, Section 215 of the Patriot Act is set to expire. Passed
shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Patriot Act,
specifically Section 215, granted federal agencies, including the National
Security Agency, increased surveillance powers to prevent additional
terrorist attacks. Some Americans have concerns that the Act does not
sufficiently protect our privacy, while others argue that surveillance is
necessary in order for the government to effectively investigate
terrorist threats. Legislation introduced in both the House and the Senate,
entitled the
USA Freedom Act ,
would reauthorize Section 215 until December 31st, 2020, with one key
reform: the bill would prohibit the indiscriminate bulk collection of
metadata from domestic phone companies, while maintaining the ability
to conduct surveillance beyond our borders.
What are your thoughts on Section
215 of the Patriot Act? I support reauthorization of Section 215 of the Patriot Act
to combat security and terrorist threats to our country. I do not support
reauthorization of Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
I support reauthorizing Section 215 of the
Patriot Act only if the National Security Agency's surveillance
practices are comprehensively reformed.
