Dear Friend,
This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved my provision to
add $5 million in funding to help eliminate the nationwide rape kit
backlog, I spoke about the need to prevent childhood hunger, and
President Obama's Administration announced their plan to reduce carbon
emissions and protect our air. Keep reading for more information about
what else happened this week.

Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of D-Day
Today is the 70th anniversary of D-Day, when 73,000 American heroes
charged onto the beaches of Normandy and helped secure a foothold that
allowed the Allies to defeat the Nazis and win World War II. Too many
of them-more than 6,600 of those brave Americans-never came back home.
I hope we all take a moment today to remember the sacrifice of those
who lost their lives as well as those who made it past the barrage of
Nazi bullets alive and kept fighting to end Hitler's quest for European
dominance. Our nation's veterans deserve our thanks and the utmost
respect.
Helping Eliminate the Memphis Rape Kit Backlog
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives debated the Fiscal Year
2015 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill, which
determines funding levels for a large number of federal programs and
agencies. I'm glad that my House colleagues voted for an amendment that
I introduced
to provide more federal resources to
local law enforcement agencies working to reduce their backlogs of
untested rape kits. Of roughly 400,000 untested rape kits sitting in
evidence rooms nationwide, an estimated 12,000 remain untested in
Memphis-more than anywhere else in the country. Untested rape kits
prevent law enforcement from apprehending violent criminals, increase
the risk of additional crimes, and rob victims of the justice they
deserve.
Yesterday, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee approved the
Senate's version of the CJS Appropriations bill and included my $5
million rape kit backlog reduction provision, which will now be
considered by the full Senate. Absolutely no one should be a victim of
sexual assault, and it is a travesty when communities are terrorized
simply because evidence that could be used to prevent these crimes sits
untested on a shelf somewhere. We know that, if tested, these rape kits
could have helped catch perpetrators and prevent additional attacks.
We must do more to cut through this backlog-it's the least we can do to
give victims the justice they deserve and it is an imperative if we
want to keep our communities safe from predators. Adding federal
funding to help cut down the nation's backlog improves the chances that
Memphis will receive the resources it needs to do the same. My
provision to provide additional funding to reduce the rape kit backlog
is a step in the right direction. On Saturday, I was glad to join a
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Alumnae Chapter forum to discuss how my
amendment will help cut through the Memphis backlog.
Preventing Childhood Hunger in Memphis
For many young people in Memphis, one of their most exciting days is
the last day of school before it lets out for the summer. But for
others-for less fortunate children in our country-school letting out
has a more negative consequence: without the lunches provided in
school, they risk going without the food they need to live happy and
healthy lives.
Access to nutritious meals is critical to a child's development. On
Monday, I joined the Summer Food Kickoff at Emerald Square in support
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Summer Food Service
Program. The program provides free, nutritious meals and snacks to help
children get the nutrients they need to learn, play, and grow
throughout the summer months when free school lunches are not provided
to them.
The wealthiest nation in the world should not send its children to bed
hungry, and making sure that they have the food they need should be one
of our top priorities. I was proud to support legislation that provided
significant funding to the program for this year, and I look forward to
supporting President Obama's request to increase funding to the Summer
Food Service Program in next year's budget. I will continue working
hard to protect this vital USDA program and to make sure that no child
in Shelby County goes hungry.
Remembering Senator Robert F. Kennedy
"There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why? I
dream of things that never were, and ask why not?" - Robert F. Kennedy,
March 18, 1986
In addition to the anniversary of D-Day, today also marks the 46th
anniversary of the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Senator
Kennedy was a tireless advocate for bringing opportunity and hope to
Americans living in the inner city. His Bedford-Stuyvesant
redevelopment project inspired me and showed me just how public
servants can transform and improve lives.
Today, Senator Robert F. Kennedy still has a special place in my heart-
as well as on the wall in my Capitol Hill office, where I keep several
photos of him. When the ACLU of Tennessee awarded me with their Bill of
Rights Award (also on my wall in the photo above), I asked that the
quote from Kennedy's speech at the University of Cape Town in South
Africa, two years to the day before his murder, be inscribed on the
award:
"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of
others, or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple
of hope. (and) those ripples build a current that can sweep down the
mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
At his funeral, RFK's brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, asked that the late
Presidential candidate "not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond
what he was in life, to be remembered simply as a good and decent man,
who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal
it, saw war and tried to stop it." It is in that spirit that I will
continue working for justice and to reduce inequality as your
Congressman.
Constitution in the Classroom at Grizzlies Prep
On Tuesday, I joined a 6th grade class at Grizzlies Prep for their
"Constitution in the Classroom" program. I enjoyed the chance to speak
with bright young students about my role as the Ninth District's
Congressman and why I chose a career in public service. I was also glad
to answer their questions about our federal government and the
legislative branch of Congress.
Promoting Clean Energy and Protecting our Environment
In 2012, Tennessee's power plants pumped as much carbon pollution into
our air as roughly 8 million cars. With nearly 1 in 10 Tennessee
children suffering from asthma, it's time to do more to protect the air
we breathe. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced
President Obama's proposal for ensuring that the future of our
environment is clean and safe. The President's proposal enables states
to create plans that will cut carbon emissions significantly, help
avoid more than 6,000 premature deaths and 150,000 asthma attacks in
children nationwide-all while providing as much as $93 billion in other
economic and public health benefits. Yesterday, I joined
representatives from the NAACP, the Sierra Club, and the Southern
Alliance for Clean Energy at a roundtable to express my support for the
President's plan. I will work with his administration to help our state
implement the plan so that Tennessee can be a leader in promoting a
cleaner and healthier environment.
Grants for Memphis
This week, I announced more than $4.5 million in funding for Memphis
organizations. The Memphis Health Center was awarded more than $3.2
million in funding
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health
Resources and Services Administration. The Memphis Health Center
provides incredibly important health services and high-quality,
affordable care to citizens throughout the Ninth District. I was
pleased to announce this significant investment of funding that will
help the Memphis Health Center achieve the goals of President Obama's
Affordable Care Act and reduce health inequalities and disparities in
Shelby County. I also announced more than $1.3 million in funding for 5
projects at the University of Memphis. You can read more about those
grants here
President Obama Seeking Mentors for Young People
It is important that all children have caring adults who are engaged in
their lives, but too many young people lack this important support.
That's why President Obama is calling on Americans to sign up as
long-term mentors to young people through his new "My Brother's Keeper"
initiative. The President is seeking people from all walks of life who
want to develop sustained and direct mentoring relationships that will
play vital roles in the lives of young people in Memphis and around the
country. If you are interested in signing up to help young adults in
our city stay on track, you can do so here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
As always, I remain.

Helping
Eliminate
the
Memphis
Rape
Kit
Backlog
Last
week,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
debated
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
Commerce,
Justice
and
Science
(CJS)
Appropriations
bill,
which
determines
funding
levels
for
a
large
number
of
federal
programs
and
agencies.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
my
House
colleagues
voted for
an
amendment
that
I
introduced
to
provide
more
federal
resources
to
local
law
enforcement
agencies
working
to
reduce
their
backlogs
of
untested
rape
kits.
Of
roughly
400,000
untested
rape
kits
sitting
in
evidence
rooms
nationwide,
an
estimated
12,000
remain
untested
in
Memphis&#8212;more
than
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
Untested
rape
kits
prevent
law
enforcement
from
apprehending
violent
criminals,
increase
the
risk
of
additional
crimes,
and
rob
victims
of
the
justice
they
deserve.
Yesterday,
the
U.S.
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
approved
the
Senate&#8217;s
version
of
the
CJS
Appropriations
bill
and
included
my
$5
million
rape
kit
backlog
reduction
provision,
which
will
now
be
considered
by
the
full
Senate.
Absolutely
no
one
should
be
a
victim
of
sexual
assault,
and
it
is
a
travesty
when
communities
are
terrorized
simply
because
evidence
that
could
be
used
to
prevent
these
crimes
sits
untested
on
a
shelf
somewhere.
We
know
that,
if
tested,
these
rape
kits
could
have
helped
catch
perpetrators
and
prevent
additional
attacks.
We
must
do
more
to
cut
through
this
backlog&#8212;it&#8217;s
the
least
we
can
do
to
give
victims
the
justice
they
deserve
and
it
is
an
imperative
if
we
want
to
keep
our
communities
safe
from
predators.
Adding
federal
funding
to
help
cut
down
the
nation&#8217;s
backlog
improves
the
chances
that
Memphis
will
receive
the
resources
it
needs
to
do
the
same.
My
provision
to
provide
additional
funding
to
reduce
the
rape
kit
backlog
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
On
Saturday,
I
was
glad
to
join
a
Delta
Sigma
Theta
Sorority
Alumnae
Chapter
forum
to
discuss
how
my
amendment
will
help
cut
through
the
Memphis
backlog.
Preventing
Childhood
Hunger
in
Memphis
For
many
young
people
in
Memphis,
one
of
their
most
exciting
days
is
the
last
day
of
school
before
it
lets
out
for
the
summer.
But
for
others&#8212;for
less
fortunate
children
in
our
country&#8212;school
letting
out
has
a
more
negative
consequence:
without
the
lunches
provided
in
school,
they
risk
going
without
the
food
they
need
to
live
happy
and
healthy
lives.
Access
to
nutritious
meals
is
critical
to
a
child&#8217;s
development.
On
Monday,
I
joined
the
Summer
Food
Kickoff
at
Emerald
Square
in
support
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture&#8217;s
(USDA)
Summer
Food
Service
Program.
The
program
provides
free,
nutritious
meals
and
snacks
to
help
children
get
the
nutrients
they
need
to
learn,
play,
and
grow
throughout
the
summer
months
when
free
school
lunches
are
not
provided
to
them.
The
wealthiest
nation
in
the
world
should
not
send
its
children
to
bed
hungry,
and
making
sure
that
they
have
the
food
they
need
should
be
one
of
our
top
priorities.
I
was
proud
to
support
legislation
that
provided
significant
funding
to
the
program
for
this
year,
and
I
look
forward
to
supporting
President
Obama&#8217;s
request
to
increase
funding
to
the
Summer
Food
Service
Program
in
next
year&#8217;s
budget.
I
will
continue
working
hard
to
protect
this
vital
USDA
program
and
to
make
sure
that
no
child
in
Shelby
County
goes
hungry.
Remembering
Senator
Robert
F.
Kennedy
&#8220;There
are
those
that
look
at
things
the
way
they
are,
and
ask
why?
I
dream
of
things
that
never
were,
and
ask
why
not?&#8221;
&#8211;
Robert
F.
Kennedy,
March
18,
1986
In
addition
to
the
anniversary
of
D-Day,
today
also
marks
the
46th
anniversary
of
the
assassination
of
Senator
Robert
F.
Kennedy.
Senator
Kennedy
was
a
tireless
advocate
for
bringing
opportunity
and
hope
to
Americans
living
in
the
inner
city.
His
Bedford-Stuyvesant
redevelopment
project
inspired
me
and
showed
me
just
how
public
servants
can
transform
and
improve
lives.
Today,
Senator
Robert
F.
Kennedy
still
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart&#8212;as
well
as
on
the
wall
in
my
Capitol
Hill
office,
where
I
keep
several
photos
of
him.
When
the
ACLU
of
Tennessee
awarded
me
with
their
Bill
of
Rights
Award
(also
on
my
wall
in
the
photo
above),
I
asked
that
the
quote
from
Kennedy&#8217;s
speech
at
the
University
of
Cape
Town
in
South
Africa,
two
years
to
the
day
before
his
murder,
be
inscribed
on
the
award:
&#8220;Each
time
a
man
stands
up
for
an
ideal,
or
acts
to
improve
the
lot
of
others,
or
strikes
out
against
injustice
he
sends
forth
a
tiny
ripple
of
hope&#8230;
(and)
those
ripples
build
a
current
that
can
sweep
down
the
mightiest
walls
of
oppression
and
resistance.&#8221;
At
his
funeral,
RFK&#8217;s
brother,
Senator
Ted
Kennedy,
asked
that
the
late
Presidential
candidate
&#8220;not
be
idealized,
or
enlarged
in
death
beyond
what
he
was
in
life,
to
be
remembered
simply
as
a
good
and
decent
man,
who
saw
wrong
and
tried
to
right
it,
saw
suffering
and
tried
to
heal
it,
saw
war
and
tried
to
stop
it.&#8221;
It
is
in
that
spirit
that
I
will
continue
working
for
justice
and
to
reduce
inequality
as
your
Congressman.
Constitution
in
the
Classroom
at
Grizzlies
Prep
On
Tuesday,
I
joined
a
6th
grade
class
at
Grizzlies
Prep
for
their
&#8220;Constitution
in
the
Classroom&#8221;
program.
I
enjoyed
the
chance
to
speak
with
bright
young
students
about
my
role
as
the
Ninth
District&#8217;s
Congressman
and
why
I
chose
a
career
in
public
service.
I
was
also
glad
to
answer
their
questions
about
our
federal
government
and
the
legislative
branch
of
Congress.
Promoting
Clean
Energy
and
Protecting
our
Environment
In
2012,
Tennessee&#8217;s
power
plants
pumped
as
much
carbon
pollution
into
our
air
as
roughly
8
million
cars.
With
nearly
1
in
10
Tennessee
children
suffering
from
asthma,
it&#8217;s
time
to
do
more
to
protect
the
air
we
breathe.
This
week,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
announced
President
Obama&#8217;s
proposal
for
ensuring
that
the
future
of
our
environment
is
clean
and
safe.
The
President&#8217;s
proposal
enables
states
to
create
plans
that
will
cut
carbon
emissions
significantly,
help
avoid
more
than
6,000
premature
deaths
and
150,000
asthma
attacks
in
children
nationwide&#8212;all
while
providing
as
much
as
$93
billion
in
other
economic
and
public
health
benefits.
Yesterday,
I
joined
representatives
from
the
NAACP,
the
Sierra
Club,
and
the
Southern
Alliance
for
Clean
Energy
at
a
roundtable
to
express
my
support
for
the
President&#8217;s
plan.
I
will
work
with
his
administration
to
help
our
state
implement
the
plan
so
that
Tennessee
can
be
a
leader
in
promoting
a
cleaner
and
healthier
environment.
Grants
for
Memphis
This
week,
I
announced
more
than
$4.5
million
in
funding
for
Memphis
organizations.
The
Memphis
Health
Center
was
awarded
more
than
$3.2
million
in
funding
from
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services&#8217;
Health
Resources
and
Services
Administration.
The
Memphis
Health
Center
provides
incredibly
important
health
services
and
high-quality,
affordable
care
to
citizens
throughout
the
Ninth
District.
I
was
pleased
to
announce
this
significant
investment
of
funding
that
will
help
the
Memphis
Health
Center
achieve
the
goals
of
President
Obama&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
and
reduce
health
inequalities
and
disparities
in
Shelby
County.
I
also
announced
more
than
$1.3
million
in
funding
for
5
projects
at
the
University
of
Memphis.
You
can
read
more
about
those
grants

President
Obama
Seeking
Mentors
for
Young
People
It
is
important
that
all
children
have
caring
adults
who
are
engaged
in
their
lives,
but
too
many
young
people
lack
this
important
support.
That&#8217;s
why
President
Obama
is
calling
on
Americans
to
sign
up
as
long-term
mentors
to
young
people
through
his
new
&#8220;My
Brother&#8217;s
Keeper&#8221;
initiative.
The
President
is
seeking
people
from
all
walks
of
life
who
want
to
develop
sustained
and
direct
mentoring
relationships
that
will
play
vital
roles
in
the
lives
of
young
people
in
Memphis
and
around
the
country.
If
you
are
interested
in
signing
up
to
help
young
adults
in
our
city
stay
on
track,
you
can
do
so
here .
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
As
always,
I
remain.
