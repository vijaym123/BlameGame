Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Honoring a Man of Integrity
This week our nation lost a
true public servant. Former Sixth District Congressman M. Caldwell Butler passed away at age 89.
It is often said that our actions in difficult situations are true indicators of character.
That holds true for
Congressman Butler.
He is remembered for many things, but none more than his service on the
House Judiciary Committee
at a difficult time in our nation&rsquo;s
history.
He was a strong voice and a sharp legal mind on the Committee and acted with integrity during the Watergate investigation and impeachment
proceedings, which ended with the resignation of former President Richard Nixon.
I knew Congressman Butler to be a man of great integrity and
intellect with a keen sense of right and wrong and a true respect for the law of the land.
It was a great honor to know, and have the privilege of working for, a man like Caldwell Butler.
Right out of law school, I served
as his District Office Manager from 1977 to 1979 and learned a great deal from him then and over the years. I am honored today to represent the Sixth
Congressional District as he did many years ago.
He gave immeasurably to the Roanoke community, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and our nation.
His
lifetime of contributions will surely not be forgotten.
My thoughts and prayers remain with the Butler family as they mourn this great loss.

in my weekly
column.
On Tuesday, I was honored to lead a moment of silence on the House Floor in remembrance of Congressman Butler. I was joined by members of the
Virginia Delegation - Frank Wolf, Robert Hurt, Morgan Griffith, Randy Forbes, Rob Wittman and Scott Rigell, to honor his legacy. Click

House Authorizes Lawsuit Against the President
On Wednesday, the House passed a resolution authorizing a
lawsuit
against President Obama&rsquo;s failure to faithfully
execute the laws. The Constitution is very clear: it is Congress&rsquo; job to write our laws and it is the President&rsquo;s duty to enforce them.
However, President Obama treats our laws as mere guidelines, picking and choosing among them which to enforce, which to ignore, and which to
effectively rewrite. As President Obama&rsquo;s signature healthcare law has proved to be unworkable and unpopular, he unilaterally delayed the
implementation of the employer mandate until at least after the next federal elections. While I oppose Obamacare and support its repeal, President
Obama does not have the authority to strike and rewrite the law&rsquo;s mandates on his own.
As Americans&rsquo; elected representatives in Congress, we have taken a solemn
oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. The House has kept this promise to the American people by authorizing litigation to restore political
accountability and enforce the rule of law. The stakes of inaction are high and we must do all we can to preserve the separation of powers enshrined
in our Constitution.
Also in the House this week...
The House passed two bills related to the border crisis on Friday. One to
stop
the expansion of President Obama's unilateral immigration
actions. The
other
provides law enforcement agents on the
ground targeted resources to assist them in doing their job of securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws.
The
Conference Report on the
Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act
(an agreement reached by a bipartisan group from the House and Senate) was also approved. Under
this legislation, if a veteran cannot get an appointment at their local VA facility in a timely manner, or lives more than 40 miles away from the
nearest VA medical facility, they can seek private care. The bill would also provide more accountability by giving the Department of Veterans Affairs
greater authority to fire senior employees who have failed to serve patients.
