Dear Friend,
I wanted to
take this opportunity to update you on recent events that have taken
place locally in the Fourth Congressional District.
This month, we
took time out to recognize our nations nurses.
I took this
opportunity to visit South Nassau Communities Hospital to recognize the
dedication, commitment and tireless efforts of nurses nationwide.
Rep.
McCarthy visited South Nassau Universities Hospital in honor of National
Nurses Week.

Chief Operating Officer Joseph Lamantia, NYS Assemblyman Harvey
Weisenberg, and Chief Nursing Officer Sue Penque
Celebrated annually from May 6 to May 12,
National Nurses Week is devoted to highlighting the diverse ways nurses
are working to improve health care.
Nurses are known
to be patient advocates and as one of the largest components of the
healthcare profession, these unsung heroes deserve to be recognized for
their important contributions.
As a nurse I know firsthand the
importance of the work our health care professionals do every day and
it was an honor to be able to highlight the work of the exceptional
work our nurses do right here at home.
To read more
about the extraordinary work of our nurses and for more about my visit at
South Nassau Communities Hospital, please visit my
website .
Thank you for your time and
attention.
As always, it is pleasure and honor to serve as your representative
in Congress.
Please feel free to reach out with any questions
or concerns or if my staff can be of assistance.
Sincerely,
Carolyn
McCarthy
Member of Congress
