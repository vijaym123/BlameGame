Federal Land Disposal Act Passes through Committee
The Natural Resources Committee passed a piece of legislation I
sponsored out of committee this week. This bill would direct the
Secretary of the Interior to sell nearly 3.3 million acres of federal
land deemed suitable for disposal. Under this legislation
, all proceeds from the
sales would be directed to the U.S. Treasury to help reduce the $17
trillion debt.
No Invite to the Super Bowl
Currently many professional sports leagues including the NFL and NHL
enjoy non-profit tax exempt status. In reality, leagues such as the NFL
and the NHL are for-profit businesses, and they should be taxed as
such. I introduced H.R. 3965, the PRO Sports Act
which would eliminate their non-profit tax
exempt status.

.
Understanding Benghazi
Recently I had the privilege of presenting "Why Benghazi Matters," at
the University of Utah and Utah Valley University campuses. This helped
those in attendance understand what happened before, during, and after
the attack in Benghazi and why the investigation still matters.
Read a recap of the meetings here
.
Additionally, the Senate Intelligence Committee recently released a
report
which concluded that the
attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi was "preventable".
Watch my reaction to the report here
