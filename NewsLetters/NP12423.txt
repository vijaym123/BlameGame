Friend,
Happy Valentine's Day! I hope you're having a great one. Unfortunately
for me, due to the snowpocalypse that hit the east coast, I'm still
stuck in our nation's capital for most of the day. Which is a shame
because this will be the first time in years that Jen and I will have
to skip our Valentine's Day tradition based around five of my favorite
words in the English language (that's right - "all you can eat fries").
Town Halls Next Week
First things first - if you're in Tacoma or Port Orchard next week, I
want to see you and hear what's on your mind!
You're my boss, so it's important I hear your take on local and
national issues and to tell me what you'd like to see from Congress
(what I'd like to see - less dysfunction, more action on growing the
economy). I also like to start town halls with a short presentation
going over the good, the bad, and the ugly of what's going on in our
nation's capital.
So next week, I'll be holding two town halls in Tacoma and Port Orchard
- I've held town halls so far in Port Angeles, Port Townsend,
Bremerton, Bainbridge Island, Aberdeen, Tacoma, Amanda Park, Sequim and
Ocean Shores and I hope to hold more before the end of the year.
Here are the details:
Port Orchard Town Hall

Working to Halt Rising Flood Insurance Premiums
Over the last few months, I've met with homeowners, real estate
professionals, and partners in local government throughout our region
who are concerned about the impact drastic increases in flood insurance
premiums will have on our local economy. This is about the basic
principle of housing affordability.
In fact, a couple of weeks ago we had a roundtable in Grays Harbor with
REALTORS and insurance professionals who discussed the impact on
property values and insurance premiums. In one instance, one
prospective homebuyer in Grays Harbor County was shocked to find that
their flood insurance quote came out to a whopping $13,000 year. After
paying $600 to show the property was elevated, the insurance quote was
still more than the monthly mortgage payment would have been. The deal
fell through.
This week I spoke on the House floor about the urgent need to bring the
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act up for a vote right away so
that we can support our homeowners and coastal communities. You can
watch it here
.
Helping Small Businesses Grow
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and I am committed to
helping them grow.
I've been working with the Washington State Procurement Technical
Assistance Center (PTAC) to convene contracting specialists from local
military commands and federal agencies for a contracting workshop in
Tacoma this month.
Local businesses and organizations will have the opportunity to engage
with contracting specialists, government buyers, and other businesses
that have had success in contracting with the federal government.
The event will also feature keynote speaker Jerome Punderson, Director
of Contracts for Naval Sea Systems Command.
It'll be on Monday, February 24 from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at the
Carwein Auditorium on the UW-Tacoma campus. You can register for free
at http://www.ptassist.com/services/ptac_register.php?id=C256141933
.
If you have any questions, please email Joe Dacca in my office at
joe.dacca@mail.house.gov, or by phone at (360) 373-9725.
Thanks as always for reading, Happy Valentine's Day, and I hope you can
make it out to one of the town halls next week.
Sincerely,
Derek

2014 Friend,
Happy
Valentine&#8217;s
Day!
I
hope
you&#8217;re
having
a
great
one.
Unfortunately
for
me,
due
to
the
snowpocalypse
that
hit
the
east
coast,
I&#8217;m
still
stuck
in
our
nation&#8217;s
capital
for
most
of
the
day.
Which
is
a
shame
because
this
will
be
the
first
time
in
years
that
Jen
and
I
will
have
to
skip
our
Valentine&#8217;s
Day
tradition
based
around
five
of
my
favorite
words
in
the
English
language
(that&#8217;s
right
&#8211;
&#8220;all
you
can
eat
fries&#8221;).
Town
Halls
Next
Week
First
things
first
&#8211;
if
you&#8217;re
in
Tacoma
or
Port
Orchard
next
week,
I
want
to
see
you
and
hear
what&#8217;s
on
your
mind!
You&#8217;re
my
boss,
so
it&#8217;s
important
I
hear
your
take
on
local
and
national
issues
and
to
tell
me
what
you&#8217;d
like
to
see
from
Congress
(what
I&#8217;d
like
to
see
&#8211;
less
dysfunction,
more
action
on
growing
the
economy).
I
also
like
to
start

and
the
ugly

capital.
So
next
week,
I&#8217;ll
be
holding
two
town
halls
in
Tacoma
and
Port
Orchard
&#8211;
I&#8217;ve
held
town
halls
so
far
in
Port
Angeles,
Port
Townsend,
Bremerton,
Bainbridge
Island,
Aberdeen,
Tacoma,
Amanda

Sequim
and
Ocean

and
I
hope
to
hold
more
before
the
end
of
the
year.
