Friend-
Wanted to loop you in on two very important bills Ive been working on with the Judiciary Committee this past week:
The first is an updated version of Congressman Gowdys SAFE Act (which I
emailed
you about earlier this year). This bill ( H.R. 1148 ) removes the ability of the President to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement, and strengthens the interior enforcement of our immigration laws by allowing state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law.
The second bill is the Legal Workforce Act ( H.R. 1147 ), which preserves jobs for legal workers by requiring U.S. employers to check the work eligibility of all future hires through the E-Verify system.
Both of these bills are positive action steps towards securing our borders, enforcing our current immigration laws, reducing illegal immigration, and saving jobs for legal workers. Ill keep you posted as they move through the House process.
Yours in service,
Randy
