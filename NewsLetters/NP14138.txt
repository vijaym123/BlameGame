Keep Your Health Plan Act
Click HERE to watch Upton's remarks
The House of Representatives today approved Congressman Fred Uptons
Keep Your Health Plan Act
(H.R. 3350) by a vote of
261 to 157 . This bipartisan legislation would allow health care plans currently available on the individual market to continue to be offered next year, expanding choices and beginning to provide peace of mind to the millions of Americans who have been left to worry in the wake of the Presidents broken promise. Under the
Keep Your Health Plan Act
all Americans would have added flexibility around their health coverage enrollment options without facing a penalty under the health care law.
Fred has heard from countless people from across Southwest Michigan who are losing their plans because of the Affordable Care Act. Fred spoke in support of H.R. 3350 before the vote and highlighted the plight of one family from Bangor, Michigan, who will lose their current plan because of the health care law.
The text of Fred's opening remarks follows:
Mr. Speaker. Across generations, presidencies are often associated with one famous utterance. Ask not, what your country can do for you The only thing we have to fear
Tear down this wall. And our current president will be no different If you like you health care plan, you can keep it. Period.
For the last three years the president repeated this promise in selling his signature law, and he did so with the knowledge that it would not be met. Millions of Americans, including nearly a quarter of a million in Michigan, took the president at his word, and are now unexpectedly receiving cancellation notices. They are confused, worried, and upset.
Today, we stand with those families with the
Keep Your Health Plan Act . This bill is to help provide peace of mind to folks like the farmer in Bangor, Michigan, who just found out after purchasing his familys insurance for the last 30 years, that he will be able to keep their plan no more. And the sticker shock will be unbearable as their premiums double and their deductible jumps nearly three thousand bucks. Sadly, theyre not alone. For millions of Americans, its cancellations today sticker shock tomorrow.
For the last six weeks, the White House stood idly by, ignoring the pleas of millions. But as the administrations allies in Congress panicked, the White House went from attacking our thoughtful bill to making an end run around Congress with a unilateral fix.
Our straightforward, one-page bill says if you like your current coverage, you should be able to keep it. The president should heed his own advice and work with us, the Congress, as the Founders intended, not around the legislative process. Everyone today should embrace the
Keep Your Health Plan Act , and our efforts to protect Americans from the damage of this law should not stop there. Lets keep the promise.
