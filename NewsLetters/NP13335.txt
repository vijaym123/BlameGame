David, I&rsquo;m really sorry to add yet one more email to your inbox, but this is important.
I just got off the phone with my team, and with just hours until our last deadline of 2013, we&rsquo;re now within $400 of our goal for this year!
Could you please visit

and make an urgent donation to put us over the top? It would mean so much to me.
Kindest personal regards,
Cheri
