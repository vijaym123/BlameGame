DECEMBER 7, 2014
This week the House passed several significant pieces of legislation. The first was H.R. 5771, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which would extend, for one year, a number of tax relief provisions that expired either at the end of calendar year 2013 or during 2014, thus preventing tax increases on millions of families and businesses as the tax year 2014 filing season begins early next year. By enacting H.R. 5771, Congress can continue to pursue its efforts to make certain expiring tax provisions permanent to provide certainty and stability to families and businesses, without causing disruption for taxpayers trying to file their 2014 tax returns.
The House also passed the ABLE Act of 2014 which gives individuals with disabilities the same opportunity to save money tax-free for things like school, retirement, and job training that any American has. This will help individuals with disabilities plan for their future and strengthen our economy.
We also took a strong step from preventing President Obama to grant blanket amnesty for 5 million illegal immigrants by passing H.R. 5759, the Executive Amnesty Prevention Act. The bill would prohibit the executive branch from exempting or deferring from deportation any immigrants considered to be unlawfully present in the United States. It also would prohibit the administration from treating those immigrants as if they were lawfully present or had lawful immigration status. It would specify that any action taken by the executive branch to circumvent the measure's prohibitions would be "null and void and without legal effect.
Finally, the House passed the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The bill authorizes $577.1 billion for the Pentagon and defense-related programs for FY 2015, of which $63.7 billion is war-related funding
including $5.1 billion requested by the president to counter the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It includes new provisions to combat sexual assault in the military, continues restrictions on the transfer of Guantnamo Bay detainees.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
