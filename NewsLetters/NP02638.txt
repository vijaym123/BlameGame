District
Dear
Friends,
This week U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen blocked
implementation of President Obamas executive actions on immigration,
allowing a lawsuit brought by Idaho and 25 other states to
proceed.
Still, we in Congress must continue the fight to overturn the
presidents unconstitutional decision to put 5 million people who came
to the U.S. illegally ahead of aspiring immigrants who play by the
rules.
Judge Hanens order temporarily shields the states
from being forced to deal with immigrants seeking government services and
benefits. As Judge Hanen wrote, Once these services are provided,
there will be no effective way of putting the toothpaste back in the
tube.
The judge also affirmed what Ive been saying for the
last few months: the presidents actions violate the basic requirements
for notice and comment under the Administrative Procedure
Act.
This conflict, however, is far more grave than a policy dispute.
The president has abandoned his fundamental constitutional duty to
faithfully execute the laws of the United States and usurped the
authority of Congress to make law.
I hope the president takes Judge
Hanens order as an opportunity to cancel his actions and restore the
separation of powers.
Perhaps the president will take a
page from Bill Clintons book and recognize that the American people
spoke in the November election. That would mean sitting down with
Congress in good faith to negotiate a lasting legislative
solution.
Unfortunately, President Obama seems more interested in politics
than policy. But the judicial branchs involvement should be a reminder
that hes on very shaky ground.
The president wouldnt get
everything he wants from Congress
blanket amnesty. But we can pass
real reform to secure our borders, boost internal enforcement and
modernize the visa system. Only a system that drives immigrants into viable
avenues for legal entry will end illegal immigration and protect the
rule of law.
Flouting core American values must never be
tolerated. Ill keep doing everything in my power to preserve, protect
and defend our Constitution.
Thank you ,
