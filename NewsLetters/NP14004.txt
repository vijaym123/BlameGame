Thanksgiving is a time for family, for friends, and for relaxation and
enjoyment with the ones you hold closest to your heart. It is also a
time to give thanks and to be grateful for people that fill your life
with joy.
I want to take a moment to give thanks to you. Thank you for
participating in this democracy. Thank you for being a concerned
citizen. Thank you for holding true to your views, while respecting
mine. And most of all, thank you for staying engaged in the debate.
Your input on the issues that matter make me a better representative
for you and our neighbors in the district.
This Thanksgiving will be enjoyed with my family in Long Beach. My wife
Debbie will be making the turkey, and I will be her Master Assistant in
the kitchen (I am not much of a cook, but Debbie assures me that I am
great at cleaning up!).
However you celebrate Thanksgiving this year, I wish you and your
family all the best.
And for those who will be celebrating the festival of lights: Happy
Hanukkah!
Thank you,
Alan Lowenthal
