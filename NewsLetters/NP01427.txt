150 days. 33 weeks. Nearly 5 months.
That&rsquo;s how long Loretta Lynch has been waiting to be confirmed as President Obama&rsquo;s second Attorney General.
She&rsquo;s waited longer than the previous
eight
Attorneys General
combined.
What&rsquo;s behind it?
The
Huffington Post
explains that &ldquo;Republicans [are using an unrelated] abortion fight to jam Lynch&rsquo;s confirmation.&rdquo;
Republicans snuck language restricting abortion into a bill meant to fight human trafficking.
And now they refuse to confirm a new Attorney General unless Democrats drop their objections and vote for the bill!
So let&rsquo;s get this straight -- Republicans won&rsquo;t give us a new Attorney General unless we submit to their anti-abortion agenda?!
RIDICULOUS.
Tell Mitch McConnell: 150 days is enough. Hold the vote to confirm Loretta Lynch.
