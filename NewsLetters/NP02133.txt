Dear
Friend,
I received some good news
this week. The Club for Growth, a limited-government group, scored my
votes for economic freedom among the most consistent in Congress.
I ranked 35th among members in 2014
and am second
among active Georgia members. I'm proud to be a free-market
conservative!
Also, a
Fox News
columnist called it a "rare victory,"
but Georgians' successful
challenge to proposed Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulations, which would have regulated common ammunition for America's most
popular rifle out of existence, was much more than that: It was a model
for conservative action.
The ATF, following another
of the president's unconstitutional orders, after Americans denied him
the power to tamper with our Second Amendment, introduced a new
"framework" targeting hunting and sporting ammunition for the AR-15. The
agency, re-interpreting 30-year old settled law, claimed criminals could
adapt AR-15 ammo for handguns. The heavier rounds could therefore be
"armor-piercing" and banned, according to a 1986 federal law Congress
intended to protect police officers.
However, in the same law, foreseeing the potential for government
overreach, Congress also included a "sporting exemption" to protect the
gun ownership rights of law-abiding citizens, whose rifles would be
obsolete without necessary ammo. Sidestepping Congress' exemption, the
agency failed to present proof that criminals are exploiting AR-15
rounds, failing even to publish its new rules in a transparent
manner.
As a member of the Congressional Sportsman's
Caucus, I'm always on the lookout for infringements on our Second
Amendment rights, essential freedoms like any other. So along with Georgia's
entire House Republican delegation,
I challenged the
ATF Director
to substantiate his agency's claims. Over 80,000
concerned citizens flooded the bureau with complaints, resulting in its
withdrawal of its proposal late last week.
Motivated and organized, we forced the agency to back off its
unconstitutional regulations, another of the president's end-runs around the
Constitution, Congress and popular opinion -- and showed how to stop him in
the future.
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
