Dear Friends,
President Obama is trying to
make good on his promise that " electricity rates would
necessarily skyrocket " under his administration's energy
policies.
According to
then-candidate
Obama :
"Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system,
electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket...Coal power plants,
natural gas, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their
operations. That will cost money.
They will pass that money
onto consumers ."
The president is
right - consumers
will
pay the price for his
administration's new burdensome regulations on coal-fired power plants - which
could cost American businesses
more than $50 billion
a year .
Our state relies on coal for
80%
of our energy.
President Obama's energy policies would
hurt low and middle-income families the most - the very people who
can't afford to pay for those higher costs.
I will
fight the president and his administration every step of the way to
stop this unprecedented power grab. That's why I've introduced amendments
in
May ,
April , and
last March
to protect families from the skyrocketing
energy costs, higher prices at the pump, and burdensome heating and
cooling bills that would result from a carbon tax.
As
always, I hope you'll join the conversation online by visiting my
website ,
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
