&ldquo;Republicans have...a 68% chance of gaining a majority.&rdquo;

The Upshot,
10/30/2014
Dear Friend,
The
New York Times
gives the Republicans better than 2-to-1 odds of taking over the Senate. If the
Times
is right, that means Democrats have about one chance in three of preventing a full-blown Tea Party Congress. This election isn&rsquo;t over until all the votes are counted, and our GOTV teams are working to make sure that
all
of our supporters get to the polls. That&rsquo;s why we need to reach this final $25,OOO goal of the campaign -- help us out with a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
If we lose the Senate, we&rsquo;re going to see the same kind of ideological gridlock we&rsquo;ve seen in the House since 2010. But you already knew that.
If we lose the Senate, the Koch brothers and their special interest empire will have succeeded in buying part of our democracy. But you already knew that, too.
There are very few secrets at this point in a campaign, and it&rsquo;s no secret that our organizers are working hard here in the Commonwealth.
Give them a boost -- chip in $5, $10, or more and help us reach our final fundraising goal of this campaign.
Thank you,
Ed
