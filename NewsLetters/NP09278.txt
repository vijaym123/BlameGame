&ldquo;The Koch brothers&rsquo; main political arm intends to spend more than $125 million this year on an aggressive ground, air and data operation benefiting conservatives&rdquo; - Politico , 5/9/14
Dear Friend,
The billionaire Koch brothers&rsquo; front group, Americans for Prosperity, recently declared their intention to spend
$125 million
on a Senate that will do their bidding. Let's put that unprecedented sum of money into perspective.
$125 million is enough to send more than 5,000 students to UMass-Amherst for free.
$125 million is about twice as much as the National Institutes of Health will spend on Alzheimer&rsquo;s research over the next five years.
$125 million is almost as much money as the federal government spends to provide heating assistance to low-income Massachusetts families in the winter.
It&rsquo;s a jaw-dropping amount of money, and it&rsquo;s altering our electoral landscape in ways we've never seen. And with the
Citizens United
and
McCutcheon
decisions, the Koch brothers have been given free rein to spend almost whatever they want to block any policies that would help middle class and working families.
This is what we&rsquo;re up against this year, and this is why I need your help to fight back --
please give $5 or whatever you can to help us stand up to this onslaught.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
The Koch brothers are fighting for an agenda that will make Big Oil richer while making it harder for working people to get ahead.
They want a Senate that can be sold to the highest bidder, and they know they need to defeat people like me to do it. I fight every day to block the Koch brothers&rsquo; agenda. That&rsquo;s why I -- and Democrats like me -- are their top enemies. Contribute $5 to help us keep the Senate blue.
Thank you for your support.
