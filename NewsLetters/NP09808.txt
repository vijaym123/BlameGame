Aloha David,
I appreciate the opportunity to stay in touch with you about the work I am doing for Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s Second Congressional District. However, according to Federal law, I am not permitted to e-mail you from May 11th until after the November 4th general election, unless you directly indicate you would like to receive updates from me.
If you would, it&rsquo;s easy to do. All you need to do is visit my website and
click here to enter your email address . Then you will continue to receive updates on news, legislation, and issues that are important to you.
As always, if you have any ideas, questions or concerns, please feel free to
send me an email
or call my Hawai&lsquo;i office at (808) 541-1986.
With aloha,
Tulsi Gabbard
Member of Congress (HI-02)
