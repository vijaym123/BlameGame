Dear David,
Americans are concerned
about the threat of Ebola - and they're increasingly worried about the
government's response to this deadly virus. According to a recent
Gallup survey , Americans are actually growing "less
confident in the federal government's ability to deal with an outbreak"
of Ebola.
While
several
agencies
recently announced steps to monitor passengers
traveling to the U.S. from West Africa, it's just not far enough.
If we're going to contain Ebola, we must start by implementing
a
temporary suspension
of travel visas for
passengers traveling from Ebola-stricken countries
immediately.
Last weekend, I spoke to Chuck Todd on NBC News's "Meet
the Press" about the Ebola outbreak - I hope you'll watch our discussion
and share your thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , or on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
