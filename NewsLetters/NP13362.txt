A
Christmas Message from Steve and Patti
Stockman
Good news from
heaven the angels bring,
Glad tidings to the earth they
sing:
To us this day a child is given,
To crown us with the joy of
heaven.
- Martin Luther
Dear
Friend,
Christmas, a beautiful day of feasting and
merriment, family and fellowship, and prayer and thanksgiving, is here once
again.
President Ronald Reagan said in 1981 that Christmas
is a state of mind, and this rings true in 2013and 2014as it has
since the day that the Savior of humankind came to earth over two
thousand years ago.
The inspiration for this heartwarming
season of reflection and worship, God's deep love for us is at the
forefront of our minds as the world's trademark hullabaloo quiets for one day
and hopes for freedom and peace are resurrected in the hearts of men
and women around the world.
As we celebrate the birth of
Christ, we would like to wish you a very merry Christmas and a happy
New Year.
Warmest wishes,
Steve and Patti
Stockman
