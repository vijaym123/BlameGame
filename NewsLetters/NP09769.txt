Dear Friend,
Senator Mike Lee (Utah) and I penned an op-ed for National Review on
our joint legislation to reform the Head Start program.
Head Start has consistently failed to fulfill its promise of improving
educational outcomes. The data is clear; we know that the current Head
Start program doesn't work. But it is possible that the money it
currently wastes might still be put to good use, once freed from that
failed bureaucracy.
Take a look and let me know what you think here
.
Sincerely,
May 15, 2014 4:00 AM
A New Head Start
The federal program doesn't work - it's time to distribute its funds to
the states and let them experiment.
By Mike Lee & Matt Salmon
Thomas Jefferson once wrote that "the preservation of freedom and
happiness" depends upon "the diffusion of knowledge among the people."
President Jefferson rightly understood that education is the
cornerstone of a free and prosperous society - a principle that is as
true today as it was in the late 18th century. Indeed, in our
high-tech, globalized economy, a solid education is the great equalizer
of opportunity and an essential ingredient for upward economic
mobility.
Yet at the same time, education costs are spiraling out of control,
straining state and local budgets. And with all the mandates handed
down from the federal government, it is becoming increasingly difficult
for communities to provide high-quality educational opportunities for
all children. Reform is needed now more than ever.
There is much work to be done at every stage of learning, from
pre-kindergarten to post-graduate. One area where reform is most
overdue: early-childhood education for the nation's most
underprivileged children.
Of the 69 federal early-childhood education and child-care programs,
Head Start, which was designed in 1965 to specifically assist
underprivileged children, is one of the oldest. And with an operating
budget of more than $8 billion per year, it's also the most expensive.
Unfortunately, despite the best of intentions, 50 years of empirical
data has shown that Head Start has consistently failed to fulfill its
promise of improving educational outcomes. According to a 2012 study by
President Obama's own Department of Health and Human Services -
published the Friday before Christmas to avoid attention - whatever
benefits children gain through the program disappear by the time they
reach the third grade.
Producing meaningful improvements in the cognitive, social, and
behavioral skills of these children is not a matter of appropriating
more taxpayer dollars - that's what we've been trying for decades.
The data is clear. We know that the current Head Start program doesn't
work. But it is possible that the money it currently wastes might still
be put to good use, once freed from that failed bureaucracy.
Real reform doesn't just cut big government; it fixes broken government
to create opportunities for parents, educators, and local policymakers
to design educational programs to meet the unique needs of their
communities.
With this in mind, we recently introduced legislation in the House and
Senate to eliminate the federal Head Start bureaucracy and repurpose
its full $8.6 billion budget to the states to spend on pre-K education
for low-income children. Without increasing the budget by a dime, our
Head Start Improvement Act would provide states with the flexibility to
administer the programs and provide technical assistance, oversight,
research, and training. The states would establish their own programs
and designate eligible pre-K entities, including both public and
private preschool establishments, to receive grants.
Empowering state and local governments to tailor programs that will
meet the unique needs of the families in their communities will not
only improve individual educational outcomes, but also foster an
innovative early-childhood-education system that encourages the 50
states to learn from each other's successes.
Continuing to fund the status quo perpetuates a pattern of failure. We
owe it to our nation's future and our children's potential to break
this cycle.
- Mike Lee is the junior senator from Utah and Matt Salmon represents
Arizona's fifth congressional district.

Head
Start
The
federal
program
doesn&#8217;t
work
&#8212;
it&#8217;s
time
to
distribute
its
funds
to
the
states
and
let
them
experiment.
By
Mike
Lee
&amp;
Matt
Salmon
Thomas
Jefferson
once
wrote
that
&#8220;the
preservation
of
freedom
and
happiness&#8221;
depends
upon
&#8220;the
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
the
people.&#8221;
President
Jefferson
rightly
understood
that
education
is
the
cornerstone
of
a
free
and
prosperous
society
&#8212;
a
principle
that
is
as
true
today
as
it
was
in
the
late
18th
century.
Indeed,
in
our
high-tech,
globalized
economy,
a
solid
education
is
the
great
equalizer
of
opportunity
and
an
essential
ingredient
for
upward
economic
mobility.
Yet
at
the
same
time,
education
costs
are
spiraling
out
of
control,
straining
state
and
local
budgets.
And
with
all
the
mandates
handed
down
from
the
federal
government,
it
is
becoming
increasingly
difficult
for
communities
to
provide
high-quality
educational
opportunities
for
all
children.
Reform
is
needed
now
more
than
ever.
There
is
much
work
to
be
done
at
every
stage
of
learning,
from
pre-kindergarten
to
post-graduate.
One
area
where
reform
is
most
overdue:
early-childhood
education
for
the
nation&#8217;s
most
underprivileged
children.
Of
the
69
federal
early-childhood
education
and
child-care
programs,
Head
Start,
which
was
designed
in
1965
to
specifically
assist
underprivileged
children,
is
one
of
the
oldest.
And
with
an
operating
budget
of
more
than
$8
billion
per
year,
it&#8217;s
also
the
most
expensive.
Unfortunately,
despite
the
best
of
intentions,
50
years
of
empirical
data
has
shown
that
Head
Start
has
consistently
failed
to
fulfill
its
promise
of
improving
educational
outcomes.
According
to
a
2012
study
by
President
Obama&#8217;s
own
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
&#8212;
published
the
Friday
before
Christmas
to
avoid
attention
&#8212;
whatever
benefits
children
gain
through
the
program
disappear
by
the
time
they
reach
the
third
grade.
Producing
meaningful
improvements
in
the
cognitive,
social,
and
behavioral
skills
of
these
children
is
not
a
matter
of
appropriating
more
taxpayer
dollars
&#8212;
that&#8217;s
what
we&#8217;ve
been
trying
for
decades.
The
data
is
clear.
We
know
that
the
current
Head
Start
program
doesn&#8217;t
work.
But
it
is
possible
that
the
money
it
currently
wastes
might
still
be
put
to
good
use,
once
freed
from
that
failed
bureaucracy.
Real
reform
doesn&#8217;t
just
cut
big
government;
it
fixes
broken
government
to
create
opportunities
for
parents,
educators,
and
local
policymakers
to
design
educational
programs
to
meet
the
unique
needs
of
their
communities.
With
this
in
mind,
we
recently
introduced
legislation
in
the
House
and
Senate
to
eliminate
the
federal
Head
Start
bureaucracy
and
repurpose
its
full
$8.6
billion
budget
to
the
states
to
spend
on
pre-K
education
for
low-income
children.
Without
increasing
the
budget
by
a
dime,
our
Head
Start
Improvement
Act
would
provide
states
with
the
flexibility
to
administer
the
programs
and
provide
technical
assistance,
oversight,
research,
and
training.
The
states
would
establish
their
own
programs
and
designate
eligible
pre-K
entities,
including
both
public
and
private
preschool
establishments,
to
receive
grants.
Empowering
state
and
local
governments
to
tailor
programs
that
will
meet
the
unique
needs
of
the
families
in
their
communities
will
not
only
improve
individual
educational
outcomes,
but
also
foster
an
innovative
early-childhood-education
system
that
encourages
the
50
states
to
learn
from
each
other&#8217;s
successes.
Continuing
to
fund
the
status
quo
perpetuates
a
pattern
of
failure.
We
owe
it
to
our
nation&#8217;s
future
and
our
children&#8217;s
potential
to
break
this
cycle.
