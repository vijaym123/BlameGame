Dear
Neighbor,
One of the things I value most about public service
is the opportunity to meet and interact with the people I serve and I
appreciate the opportunity to interact with each of you and hear your
thoughts and concerns. It is fundamental to our democracy and my
ability to serve you in Congress.
On
June 1st at 8:00
pm
I will hold my 23rd
telephone town hall meeting since
coming to Congress. This is a great opportunity for me to hear
directly from you about your views on the 114th Congress and issues facing
our nation.
At 8 pm, tens of thousands of constituents
from Virginias 11th District will be called to participate in the
hour-long meeting.
However, if you want to guarantee you get called
and have an opportunity to participate in this telephone town hall, you
can sign up by visiting the website at:
http://connolly.house.gov/sign-up-for-a-telephone-town-hall/
Since January 2009,
more than 400,000 11th District residents have participated in these
calls.
I frequently hear from constituents that they enjoy this
convenient format that allows them to participate from their home or
cell phone and have the freedom to stay on the call as long as they like.
This format also allows us to discuss a wide-range of issues before
Congress, including the economy, transportation funding, the
environment, foreign affairs, federal employee issues and health care.
And
for those who are unable to pose their question during the call, they
will have the option of leaving a message and receiving a follow-up
response.
If you cannot participate in this telephone
townhall you can still share your thoughts via email by visiting my
website at
Connolly.house.gov , or on
Twitter ( @GerryConnolly ) and
Facebook .
I value
your thoughts and opinions and hope you will be able to join us
June 1st
at 8:00 pm.
Sincerely,
Gerald E. Connolly
Member of Congress
