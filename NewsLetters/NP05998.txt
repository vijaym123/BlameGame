Friend,
Did you see Ami&#39;s email yesterday? We&#39;re all very proud of the fact that a group of grassroots supporters has stepped up and committed to match all donations until tonight&#39;s midnight deadline -
can you click here and give $5 or $10 right now to help Ami&#39;s team hit their goal?
This deadline is truly the most important one my husband has faced
- and if Team Bera doesn&#39;t hit this goal, they&#39;ll have to start making cuts to all the get-out-the-vote programs they&#39;ve worked so hard to implement. We simply can&#39;t let that happen.
Please click here and give $5 or more so that things can continue as planned - and remember, your donations today will be doubled!
Thank you,
Janine Bera, MD
PS - I&#39;m so proud of everything that Ami has accomplished - and I know that he has more work to do. The only way he&#39;ll be able to continue his work is with your help.
Please click here and give $5, $10, or more right now.
