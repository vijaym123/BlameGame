Dear friends,
This week, Id like to wish you
and yours a happy and safe Thanksgiving. This holiday, Im planning on
spending time with my family and also visiting with many South
Floridians.
I am particularly thankful to the adoptive parents who
have given so many children a home to call their own. November marks
National Adoption Month, a month to raise awareness of the national
importance of adoption by loving families. Adoptive parents provide
children with the support they need to grow and develop to achieve their
potential. As a Member of Congress, I am proud to support initiatives
stemming from National Adoption Month to bring attention to the
thousands of children currently in foster care awaiting the love of a
permanent and caring family.
Unfortunately, far too many children
in our nation lack the support provided by loving parents and a stable
family. Today, more than 100,000 children nationwide are still without
an adoptive family. The future of our children must be one of our
highest priorities as a community and as a nation. For this reason, I
proudly joined Rep. John Lewis (GA-05) in introducing the Every Child
Deserves a Family Act.
This bill promotes the best interests of
children in the foster care system by increasing their access to safe,
supportive, and permanent homes by allowing a larger pool of loving
parents to adopt. It is my hope that this bill will help reduce the number
of children in foster care, by giving them the opportunity to grow
and develop in the safety of a supportive home.
Over the
years, because of efforts made during National Adoption Month, thousands
of at-risk, abused, and neglected children have been afforded the
opportunity to grow up in safe, welcoming environments that promote their
personal development.
Since 1999, individuals and communities
have joined together to advocate and create events that bring children in
foster care together with parents who want to enrich their lives by
adopting a child.
Through these efforts, thousands of children
have found nurturing families.
Every child dreams of a welcoming
home and for National Adoption Month, I am proud to help raise
awareness to help make their dreams possible.
I hope you take these
upcoming special days to enjoy time with your loved ones as you
gather around the table filled with turkey and its trimmings. From my
family to yours, we wish you a happy Thanksgiving.
