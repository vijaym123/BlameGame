Thinking About the Future
Last week I stopped by Wheeler High School to get a tour of
their impressive STEM program. You can view photos of my visit
by

As one who was inspired at a young age to pursue medicine, Im
encouraged to see these students engaging in quality math and science
opportunities. The lessons and skills they are learning will help them
not only in their schooling but later on as they become the next
generation of leaders tackling the future challenges our great country will
no doubt face. Right now, it is imperative that we ensure we
leave a nation that is stronger and more prosperous so that these
students will have greater opportunities to pursue their
dreams.
To do that, we have to be open and
honest about the threat our growing $17 trillion debt poses to
America's economy and our national security. It would be unfair and
irresponsible for us to leave this problem to future generations. It is also
impossible for us to ignore it because the consequences of inaction are
not decades in the future
they are in many ways manifesting
themselves today. Rising deficits, debt, and looming insolvencies of federal
trust funds threaten the livelihood of our nations citizens. Programs
like Medicare and Social Security
critical lifelines for millions of
Americans
are on an unsustainable path. Failure to address these
challenges now will only result in even more necessary and drastic
actions in the future.
In short, the
status quo is unacceptable. That is why we need to keep the
conversation going about how we can and will solve the nation's fiscal
challenges. To that end, I recently distributed to my House Republican
colleagues a one-page document that chronicles in no uncertain terms the
seriousness of the challenges we face. You can view that document
by

or by going to
tom.house.gov/ChallengesWeFace .
There you'll also find
a
short video
making the case for action. I
encourage you to check it out.
These are the challenges we face. We have an obligation to make
responsible decisions today so that our kids and grandkids inherit a
strong, stable and secure America.
