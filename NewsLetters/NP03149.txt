Working To Increase Access to Public
Lands
1/27/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn released a statement praising the
transfer of the Jones Park land to the administration of El Paso
County.
"As an avid hiker myself,
I understand the importance of access to public lands. These lands
belong to all of us, not to faceless bureaucrats in Washington DC. That's
why, when numerous constituents reached out to me to express their
concerns regarding overreach from the Forest Service, I began to
advocate for local solutions that would provide the most access to citizens
and reduce entanglements from speculative federal environmental impact
studies. I want to thank Colorado Springs Utilities, the Colorado
Springs City Council, and the El Paso County Board of County Commissioners
for their responsiveness in coming to a timely solution that
preserves this local jewel for local use.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
