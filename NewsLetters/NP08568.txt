The IRS Owes You An
Apology
Today, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified before the Ways and
Means Committee that I sit on and confirmed through his
contradictory
testimony that he withheld key evidence from the
congressional investigation into IRS targeting, and
intentionally
misled
the committee when he promised in May to deliver all of
Ms. Lois Lerners emails without limitation.
His continued claims that none of Ms.
Lerners emails have been lost is contradicted by the IRSs newest invention
that her hard-drive and server containing key years of emails has
been irretrievably damaged and lost, along with the emails of
six other key figures
in the IRS investigation.
Thats simply not
believable.
Given
the clear evidence of criminal violations and confirmed pattern of
untruthful agency statements, Commissioner Koskinen now leads the
most corrupt and deceitful
IRS in the history of the agency.
Its apparent he is no longer working for the American people, but it
is one more in a long line of recent IRS commissioners whose main
purpose is to
mislead investigators and cover up this
scandal.
Congressional
Democrats
kept apologizing
to Commissioner Koskinen
and seem to believe
he is the victim
and is owed an
apology for being pressed to provide truthful answers into the
investigation of IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs. But I
say he owes the targeted taxpayers an apology for the IRS trying to
silence their voices.
Ways &amp; Means Committee Chairman Dave, myself and
the rest of the Republicans on the committee are committed to getting
the
full truth
of why the IRS targeted Americans for
their political beliefs and who exactly was involved. Chairman Camp's
call for a specialist to investigate the forensic evidence may not be
palatable to Commissioner Koskinen, but we believe it's
necessary
to get to the bottom of this scandal. I'll keep you
updated on what happens next. In the meantime, I'll be on the Kelly File on
Fox News
tonight
to talk about this with Martha
MacCallum. Tune in at 8:00 pm CT.
