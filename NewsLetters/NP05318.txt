Dear
Friends,
Recently, I was honored with the privilege of being
the Grand Marshal at an event to help end Lupus in
Miami.
Lupus is a cruel mystery affecting 1.5 million Americans, including
100,000 Floridians and 28,000 residents here in our South Florida
community. Along with the other Co-Chairs of the Congressional Lupus Caucus
Reps. Tom Rooney, Jim Moran, and Bill Keating
I am working hard to
ensure those suffering with Lupus, and their families, have a voice in
Congress.
Lupus disproportionately affects women
and minorities
in fact, minorities are 2 to 3 times more likely than
Caucasians to be affected and 90% of total lupus diagnosed cases are
women. Yet awareness of these important facts is still lacking in many
communities and even with many doctors that serve these
communities.
We are fighting to raise awareness about the effects on
these groups
including through The Lupus Initiative, which assists
students and doctors in diagnosis and treatment. We are supporting
efforts and funding for lupus research, data collection, education, and
awareness
all with the goal of one day finding a cure.
We
are fighting for funding for the CDCs National Lupus Patient Registry
to ensure accurate data about those suffering from Lupus. We are also
fighting to have the Lupus Federal Working Group update its goals, and
create a coordinated action plan so that were working in the most
effective way possible.
Finally, we are also fighting for the
Patients Access to Treatment Act, which puts limits on the cost-sharing
requirements insurance companies can impose for specialty drugs.
Insurance companies are charging exorbitant prices for these life-changing
and life-saving drugs
and with this bill, we can put medication for
Lupus patients within reach.
Thanks to efforts like these,
we have seen substantial progress this past decade in Lupus research
and awareness but much more work remains. Too little is known about the
cause of Lupus, how to diagnosis it quickly and accurately, and most
importantly, how to cure it.
We can and must do more
I look
forward to continue working to finally solve this cruel mystery once
and for all.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
