Veterans' health care returning to Raymond
The VA responded to my efforts and agreed to deploy its mobile medical unit to Raymond once a quarter. It was my pleasure to welcome their first visit in October.
After two years of urging the VA to utilize its mobile medical unit here in Southwest Washington, the VA responded and deployed it to Raymond in October for the first time ever. During that week, 48 veterans received appointments, information and applications for enrolling in healthcare. Other VA benefits were handed out, and VA staff was available to answer questions.
The VA has also committed to sending the mobile medical unit to Raymond every three months for follow-up and new appointments for veterans in the area.
The mobile medical unit will be back in Raymond the week of January 12. It is my hope that many local veterans will take advantage of this convenient access point for health services.
The VAs mobile medical unit will be coming to Raymond to provide primary services to veterans on the following dates:
Monday, January 12 through Thursday, January 15, 2015
Jan. 12, 2015
9:30 am -3pm
Jan. 13, 2015
8am-3pm
Jan. 14, 2015
8am-3pm
Jan. 15, 2015
8am-12:30 pm
The mobile medical unit will be at the following location:
The American Legion
221 Duryea St
Raymond, WA 98577
If you are a veteran who is already registered within the VA system, walk-up appointments will be available without appointment. If you wish, you can also set up an appointment by calling 1-800-329-8387 ext. 71234 and ask for the mobile medical unit in Raymond. If you are not in the VA system, you can get help with initial registration at the mobile medical unit.
