Duncan Named Tennessees Top Taxpayer Hero
WASHINGTON
Congressman John J. Duncan, Jr. (R-Tenn.) was honored this week as Tennessees
top Taxpayer Hero by the Nations largest non-partisan watchdog group dedicated to eliminating waste in government.
The Council for the Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) gave Duncan a 94% score for his voting record in 2013, higher than any other federal
representative from Tennessee in Congress.
The high mark earned Duncan CCAGWs Taxpayer Hero status.
The score is based off of 80 votes in the House of Representatives and 48 votes in the Senate on bills that helped protect and save the taxpayers
money or were against the legislators own interests.
CCAGW has issued the rankings since 1989.
There is waste, fraud and abuse in every agency and at every level of the federal government, Duncan said. I am so glad there is a group like Citizens
Against Government Waste that holds lawmakers accountable for their votes and seeks to eliminate this waste.
A business that continually wastes money will very soon go out of business, but a government agency that wastes money just seems to get increased
funding. Every dollar you can keep in the private sector will do more to create jobs and keep prices low than any dollar turned over to the government to spend, Duncan continued.
You can never satisfy the government's appetite for money or land. Our Nation's debt has now reached an astounding $17.6 trillion, a number no one
can really even comprehend.
This Nation keeps printing more and more money.
That is going to speed up in the years ahead if we don't get much more fiscally conservative at the Federal level, Duncan continued.
CCAGW applauds the Taxpayer Heroes for their courageous votes to cut wasteful spending, reduce taxes, and make government more accountable to taxpayers,
CCAGW President Tom Schatz said. In todays dismal fiscal climate, the actions of these members are a bulwark against the spendthrift behavior of their more wasteful colleagues.
