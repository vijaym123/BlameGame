CONGRESSMAN PEARCE
WISHES EVERYONE A HAPPY FATHERS DAY!
Today, Cynthia and I were blessed to spend time with
loved ones and reflect on the many blessings family brings. Fathers Day
is a special day to celebrate and thank the strong male role models
in our families and communities. Being a father to my daughter Lori has
been one of my most treasured life experiences, and now I have the
pleasure of taking on a new role and watching my grandchildren grow.
From our family to yours, Happy Fathers Day!
PEARCE STATEMENT ON HIS NO VOTE
ON FAST-TRACK (TPA) BILL
U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued the following statement on the
reconsidered Trade Promotion Authority bill, also known as fast-track
(H.R. 2146).
While I strongly
support free trade agreements to decrease our nations trade deficit and
promote U.S. manufacturing globally
todays fast-track bill (TPA)
again did not provide the guarantees needed to ensure free and fair
trade, Pearce stated.
Unchanged from last weeks vote, this bill still lacked significant
principles that need to be included in any such measure, like competitive
currency standards, fair trading practices, and including the opinion of
the American people. And, it will still be nearly impossible for one
Member, or even one chamber of Congress, to prevent the implementation
of a treaty that does not include the principles we all
support.
The American people must have faith
that Congress will act on their behalf. With no meaningful change to
ensure them that their questions and concerns will be given
consideration in the treaty approval process, I cannot support todays bill,
Pearce added.
