Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Supreme Court Rules on
Presidential Power Grab
This week the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution and
overstepped his constitutional authority by going around the Senate to appoint individuals to the National Labor Relations Board.
While it is not new
for presidents to make recess appointments, President Obama took this to an unprecedented level. This abuse of the recess appointment process is in
blatant violation of the Constitution since the Senate was not in recess. Not to mention that in bypassing the formal Senate confirmation process, the
ability of the American people to properly examine the background or public records of the nominees was eliminated.
Unfortunately, this
instance of President Obama violating the Constitution is just part of a broader pattern of ignoring or rewriting the laws Congress has passed. Time
and again, President Obama has used his pen and phone to legislate by executive decree rather than work with Americans&rsquo; elected representatives.
The House has passed legislation to stop President Obama&rsquo;s executive overreach but the Senate has refused to act on it. That is why I strongly
support Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s decision to bring a lawsuit against President Obama for his lawlessness.
TUNE IN:
I will join &quot;Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace&quot;
to discuss this ongoing pattern of executive overreach. It's live at 9AM this Sunday on Fox. Click

The Sixth District's Got Talent!
It was a privilege to welcome
Briannah Ecklund, winner of the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia&rsquo;s 2014 Congressional Art Competition, to Washington this week for an
awards ceremony in the Capitol. Her watercolor piece,
Piedmont
Mill , is now on display in the Cannon Tunnel of the U.S. Capitol for one year as part of an
impressive display of artwork from high school artists from across the nation. Briannah is a rising junior at Heritage High School in Lynchburg.
After seeing Piedmont Mill in the Capitol, I think it is by far one of the best pieces on display. I wish
Briannah the best of luck as she continues to expand her artistic talents!

WEEKLY COLUMN:
An
Administration-Made Disaster at the Border
Hundreds of teenagers and children are arriving at the border in South
Texas in unprecedented numbers, making the dangerous journey from Central America through Mexico and then walking miles across a hostile border
environment, assisted by smugglers, to enter the United States in violation of the law. According to Deputy Border Patrol Chief, Ronald Vitiello, the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expects to apprehend more than 90,000 unaccompanied minors on the border just this year.
President
Obama&rsquo;s refusal to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in an Administration-made crisis along our southern border. Word has spread about
the Administration&rsquo;s lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged thousands of children, teenagers, and families to come to the
U.S. illegally. In response to this alarming problem, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Wednesday to hear directly from those who are
witnessing the disastrous effects of the President&rsquo;s policies on the border. Read my
weekly column
for more on this issue.
