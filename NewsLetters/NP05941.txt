Academy Day hosted at Moody Air Force Base
Rep. Austin Scott introduces legislation to protect the declining bee
population
House passes bill that could preserve West Hunter Street Baptist
building
I have been enjoying some great meetings back in Georgia this past
week. On Wednesday, I met with the GA Cotton Commission. It is an honor
to represent our Eighth District Farmers on the House Agriculture
Committee in Congress.
Good news for South Georgian veterans:
A new veteran's clinic opened last week in Albany in conjunction with
the Marine Corp Logistics Base and the Navy Hospital.
While I do not
directly represent Albany, many veterans in the South part of my
district will now have access to more specialty care services closer to
home as a result of its opening.
As a reminder, if you need help with your veterans' benefits, please do
not hesitate to contact one of my district offices either in Warner
Robins or Tifton!
You can find the numbers and contact information at
the bottom of this email.
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress
