In case you missed it, Congressman Rigell distributed the following press release last night after the House of Representatives passed the 2015 spending bill:

Rigell Supports 2015 Spending Bill
Allows Republican-Led Senate and House to Defund
Presidents Immigration Executive Order in Early 2015
Washington, D.C. - Today Congressman Scott Rigell (VA-02) voted for and the House of Representatives passed H.R. 83, which advances the best strategy to properly fund the federal government while stopping President Obama from executing his recently announced immigration executive order.
Specifically, the legislation funds the Department of Homeland Security through February 27, 2015 and the remainder of the government through September 30, 2015.
This puts Congress, with a Republican-led House and Senate, in the strongest position to block and defund the Presidents executive order.
I share the view of many respected constitutional scholars that the Presidents executive order, which effectively grants amnesty to five million illegal immigrants, is unlawful, said Rigell. The goals of defunding his immigration executive order and maintaining a strong national defense are best advanced by voting FOR full appropriations for the federal government with exception of the Department of Homeland Security.
A short term funding bill for that agency places a Congress fully controlled by Republicans in the strongest position to properly address this executive order without a painful government shutdown that would jeopardize our troops salaries and veterans care, and harm our national economy.
If signed into law, the legislation will achieve one of Rigells key objectives: wisely reducing federal spending. In fact, the Republican-led House has reduced overall discretionary spending by more than $300 billion since FY 2010.
The bill also rolls back excessive regulations and substantially reduces funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from its all-time high in 2009 and reduces its staffing to the lowest level since 1989.
The legislation protects national security interests, including the shipbuilding and maritime industries, including funds to refuel the USS George Washington (CVN-73).
The bill also blocks the Obama administration from imposing new fees on American energy, while providing additional funds to properly leverage and harvest both onshore and offshore energy resources.
Rigell, a newly-elected member to the Appropriations Committee in the 114th Congress, said: Though the merits of H.R. 83 are many, it also contains flaws. They are largely a result, I believe, of the actions by Senator Reid, a consistent obstructionist, who has blocked every single appropriations bill from coming to the Senate floor this year.
As a result, the options to fund the government are sharply limited.
It is highly unlikely that another government shutdown of five, 10, 15 days, or even more would lead to a reversal of the Presidents executive order.
Additionally, it was clear that the alternative to passage was yet another short-term continuing resolution that would neither defund the Presidents immigration executive order nor include the positive aspects of H.R 83.
Passage of this bill advances a better strategy to block the Presidents unlawful actions while providing much needed continuity and certainty in meeting our nations most critical needs
which includes a strong national defense.
