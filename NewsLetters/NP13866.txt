Dear Friend,
Thanksgiving is a time to spend with family and friends.
It is also a
time where we reflect and give thanks for the many blessings in our
lives. As Americans and Hoosiers, we inherently have much to be
thankful for.
However, there are many Hoosiers who are not having the
Thanksgiving they planned for several weeks ago.
Last week, many Hoosiers experienced adversity in the form of severe
storms and tornadoes.
Almost two weeks later, some normalcy is
returning to those who saw minor damage, but there are still some of
our neighbors who are not in their own homes today.
For others, damage
may be less severe than the loss of their home or temporary
displacement, but they are experiencing some degree of hardship this
Thanksgiving due to these storms.
I ask that you keep these families,
our neighbors, in your thoughts and prayers this holiday season.
While there was great damage to property and belongings, we should all
be thankful that there was not a single Hoosier death reported due to
these violent storms.
We should also be thankful for something else
that I witnessed during my many visits to impacted areas of the 4th
District last week.
As I surveyed the damage, I saw something that as Hoosiers we've seen
before - and that was the caring and generosity all Hoosiers show each
other.
Whether it was the children that were volunteering to clean up
the park in Lebanon last Tuesday afternoon, or the neighbors who were
digging in to help begin the long cleanup and rebuilding process in
Lafayette or Kokomo, Hoosiers didn't wait for someone to come help
them.
As the cleanup and rebuilding continues, I am certain that the
generosity from neighbors will too.
It has always inspired me that the
people of this great state are so compassionate towards one another.
It is humbling to represent them in Congress.
Whether it is Thanksgiving or any other day of the year, we should be
thankful for the good neighbors we have in this great state.
On behalf of my family - Kathy, Teddy, and Ryan - and my staff, I wish
you a wonderful Thanksgiving.
May you be surrounded by family and the
warmth of home.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Dear Friend,
Thanksgiving
is
a
time
to
spend
with
family
and
friends.
It
is
also
a
time
where
we reflect
and
give
thanks
for
the
many
blessings
in
our
lives. As
Americans
and
Hoosiers,
we
inherently
have
much
to
be
thankful
for.
However,
there
are
many
Hoosiers
who
are
not
having
the
Thanksgiving
they
planned
for
several
weeks
ago.
Last
week,
many
Hoosiers
experienced
adversity
in
the
form
of
severe
storms
and
tornadoes.
Almost
two
weeks
later,
some
normalcy
is
returning
to
those
who
saw
minor
damage,
but
there
are
still
some
of
our
neighbors
who
are
not
in
their
own
homes
today.
For
others,
damage
may
be
less
severe
than
the
loss
of
their
home
or temporary
displacement,
but
they
are experiencing
some
degree
of
hardship
this
Thanksgiving
due
to
these
storms.
I
ask
that
you
keep
these
families,
our
neighbors,
in
your
thoughts
and
prayers
this
holiday
season.
While
there
was
great
damage
to
property
and
belongings,
we
should
all
be
thankful
that
there
was
not
a
single
Hoosier
death
reported due
to these
violent
storms.
We
should
also
be
thankful
for
something
else
that
I
witnessed
during
my
many
visits
to
impacted
areas
of
the
4th
District
last
week.
As
I
surveyed
the
damage,
I
saw
something
that
as
Hoosiers
we've
seen
before
-
and
that
was
the
caring
and
generosity
all
Hoosiers
show
each
other.
Whether
it
was
the
children
that
were
volunteering
to
clean
up
the
park
in
Lebanon
last
Tuesday
afternoon,
or
the
neighbors
who
were
digging
in
to
help
begin
the
long
cleanup
and
rebuilding
process
in
Lafayette
or
Kokomo,
Hoosiers
didn't
wait
for
someone
to
come
help
them.
As
the
cleanup
and
rebuilding
continues,
I
am
certain
that
the
generosity
from
neighbors
will
too.
It has
always
inspired
me that
the
people
of
this
great
state
are
so
compassionate
towards
one
another.
It
is
humbling
to
represent
them
in
Congress.
Whether
it
is
Thanksgiving
or
any
other
day
of
the
year,
we
should
be
thankful
for
the
good
neighbors
we
have
in
this
great
state.
On
behalf
of
my
family
-
Kathy,
Teddy,
and
Ryan
-
and
my
staff,
I
wish
you
a
wonderful
Thanksgiving.
May
you
be
surrounded
by
family
and
the
warmth
of
home.
Sincerely,
Todd
