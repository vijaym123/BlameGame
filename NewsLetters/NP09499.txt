Legislation
Dear Friends,
Its been quite a week in Washington and, surprisingly, a week where Republicans and Democrats were able to agree on some meaningful legislation.
Most importantly for the State of Georgia was
passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRRDA), which green lights the expansion of the Savannah Harbor , the single biggest infrastructure project we have going on in the state.
The deepening of the Port of Savannah will support more than 350,000 jobs and directly impacts every single county in the 12th District.
This week we also reached a turning point in the ongoing investigation into what went wrong at veterans clinics across the country. Weve had
our problems here in Georgia, but it now appears that these problems have affected thousands of veterans in dozens if VA medical centers all across the country.
After months with no answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs, it was time to hold someone accountable.
Regrettably, I believe that has to include Secretary Eric Shinseki.
He served this country with distinction in the military, and he has done some good things at the VA, but I believe that the time has come to get some new people in there to start to rebuild the program.
You can watch my remarks on the House floor regarding Secretary Shinsekis service to this country.

Also this week, the House passed legislation, which I cosponsored,
to make it easier for the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to remove an employee of the agency for poor performance . It's increasingly obvious that there is too much job security and not enough accountability in the upper management of the VA, and most everyone agrees that this has contributed to the inefficient and neglectful management if patient care. The only way to hold anyone accountable at the VA is if folks can be fired when they fail to provide the services we provide to our veterans.
Its common sense, bipartisan legislation that will help improve service in the VA.
As you can see, this was a busy but (relatively) productive week.
Weve got a lot of work to do to make sure our veterans are taken care of, and you have my commitment to continue to fight for the folks who fought for our country.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
