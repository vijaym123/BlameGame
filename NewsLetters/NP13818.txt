Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
It is my hope that you had a Happy Thanksgiving
amongst family and friends! This year, I am grateful that I have the
privilege to serve Florida's Sixth District in Congress.
This week we learned that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has
exempted his key staffers from ObamaCare.
To have
what Lincoln called a government "of the people, by the people, and for
the people" requires, at the very least, that those who make the laws
also live under those laws. Imposing burdens on others while relieving
yourself of those same burdens is not exactly what Lincoln had in mind
when he spoke of a republican system of government. It is not tenable
to have a system in which the people are required to abide by the laws
but those who make the laws are allowed to pick and choose which laws
to obey. Earlier this year, I introduced a proposed 28th Amendment that
would force Congress to live under the laws they pass. Learn more by
clicking here.
As you know, the President has suspended and disregarded portions of
ObamaCare without any authorization from Congress. On Tuesday, the
House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the President's
constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. During the hearing,
Jonathan Turley, a liberal law professor from George Washington
University, argued
that "the problem
with what the president is doing is that he's not simply posing a
danger to the constitutional system. He's becoming the very danger the
Constitution was designed to avoid. That is the concentration of power
in every single branch."
During the hearing, I questioned Mr. Simon Lazarus, Senior Counsel at
the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, on the legality of
the President's unilateral decision to disregard ObamaCare's
grandfather clause as well as the origins of the "Take Care" clause.
Watch my full line of questioning by clicking here.
I was not impressed with the efforts of Mr. Lazarus to
justify the incumbent's conduct. If the notion that the President could
unilaterally suspend laws was proposed while the Constitution was being
written, the Founding Fathers would have thrown a fit. Watch my
interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro on this topic by clicking here.
This week, I joined Greta Van Susteren to discuss ObamaCare's broken
promises and what steps the House Committee on Oversight & Government
Reform is taking to investigate when the Administration became aware
that these promises would be impossible to fulfill. Watch the full
interview by clicking here.
We all remember President Obama's vow that "if you like your doctor,
you can keep your doctor." Unfortunately for many Americans, this
simply isn't true. Due to ObamaCare's mandates, many have lost their
preferred health care plans and access to the doctors they know and
trust. Millions of Americans made a determination about the best health
care plan for their family and the federal government has essentially
overruled that judgment. You - not federal bureaucrats - know what
health care plan is best for your family.

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
It
is
my
hope
that
you
had
a
Happy
Thanksgiving
amongst
family
and
friends!
This
year,
I
am
grateful that
I
have
the privilege
to
serve
Florida's
Sixth
District
in
Congress.
This
week
we
learned
that
Senate
Majority
Leader
Harry
Reid has
exempted
his
key
staffers
from
ObamaCare.
To
have
what
Lincoln
called
a
government
&#8220;of
the
people,
by
the
people,
and
for
the
people&#8221;
requires,
at
the
very
least,
that
those
who
make
the
laws
also
live
under
those
laws.
Imposing
burdens
on
others
while
relieving
yourself
of
those
same
burdens
is
not
exactly
what
Lincoln
had
in
mind
when
he
spoke
of
a
republican
system
of
government.
It
is
not
tenable
to
have
a
system
in
which
the
people
are
required
to
abide
by
the
laws
but
those
who
make
the
laws
are
allowed
to
pick
and
choose
which
laws
to
obey. Earlier
this
year,
I
introduced
a
proposed
28th
Amendment
that
would
force
Congress
to
live
under
the
laws
they
pass.
Learn
more
by
clicking
here.
As
you
know,
the
President
has
suspended
and
disregarded
portions
of
ObamaCare
without
any
authorization
from
Congress.
On
Tuesday,
the
House
Judiciary
Committee held
a hearing
on
the
President&#8217;s
constitutional
duty
to
faithfully
execute
the
laws. During
the
hearing,
Jonathan
Turley,
a
liberal
law
professor
from
George
Washington
University,
argued
that
&#8221;the
problem
with
what
the
president
is
doing
is
that
he's
not
simply
posing
a
danger
to
the
constitutional
system.
He's
becoming
the
very
danger
the
Constitution
was
designed
to
avoid.
That
is
the
concentration
of
power
in
every
single
branch.&#8221;
During
the
hearing,
I
questioned
Mr.
Simon
Laza rus,
Senior
Counsel
at
the
liberal
Constitutional
Accountability
Center,
on
the
legality
of
the
President&#8217;s
unilateral
decision
to
disregard
ObamaCare&#8217;s
grandfather
clause
as
well
as
the
origins
of
the
"Take
Care"
clause.
Watch
my
full
line
of
questioning
by
clicking
here.
I
was
not
impressed
with
the
efforts
of
Mr.
Lazarus
to
justify
the
incumbent&#8217;s
conduct.
If
the
notion
that
the
President
could
unilaterally
suspend
laws
was
proposed
while
the
Constitution
was
being
written,
the
Founding
Fathers
would
have
thrown
a
fit.
Watch
my
interview
with
Judge
Jeanine
Pirro
on
this
topic
by
clicking
here.
This
week,
I
joined
Greta
Van
Susteren
to
discuss
ObamaCare's broken
promises
and
what
steps
the
House
Committee
on
Oversight
&amp;
Government
Reform
is
taking
to
investigate
when
the
Administration
became
aware
that
these
promises
would
be
impossible
to
fulfill.
Watch
the
full
interview
by
clicking
here.
We
all
remember
President
Obama's
vow
that
"if
you
like
your
doctor,
you
can
keep
your
doctor."
Unfortunately
for
many
Americans,
this
simply
isn't
true.
Due
to
ObamaCare's
mandates,
many
have
lost
their
preferred
health
care
plans
and
access
to
the
doctors
they
know
and
trust.
Millions
of
Americans
made
a
determination
about
the
best
health
care
plan
for
their
family
and
the
federal
government
has
essentially
overruled
that
judgment.
You
-
not
federal
bureaucrats
-
know
what
health
care
plan
is
best
for
your
family.
