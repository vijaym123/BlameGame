President Obama has emailed you.
Hillary Clinton has emailed you.
And now I&rsquo;m emailing you.
We wouldn&rsquo;t all keep asking if it wasn&rsquo;t so important.
Right now, we have a shot at winning races in blood-red states like Nebraska, West Virginia and Arkansas. Quite frankly -- these are opportunities that no one expected just a few weeks ago. But we still don&rsquo;t have the resources to get out the votes we need to win on Election Day. So, I&rsquo;m pleading with you, David. Can you please chip in something right now?
Will you step up?
