Dear David Johnson,
This Sunday's Super Bowl is especially exciting because New York
and New Jersey have the honor of hosting the game this year.
I am
personally looking forward to joining in the festivities with family
and friends in Queens.
However, it is important for all of us to remember that hosting
this event comes with responsibilities we all share. Each year, the
Super Bowl is a magnet for human sex trafficking. But it doesn't have
to stay that way. We can all do our part to combat this horrific
practice.
Human trafficking is a national problem, and I am a co-sponsor of
legislation that would strengthen laws against sex trafficking of
children by eliminating the requirement that the law enforcement has to
prove that the trafficker knew the victim was under 18 years of age.
I hope you take a minute to read my op-ed in the Huffington Post
, written with Peter Ward, New York Hotel-Motel Trades
Council President, on the ways that we are working together to educate
hotel workers to combat trafficking.
Sincerely,
Grace Meng
Member of Congress
Hotel Industry Combats Sex Trafficking at Super Bowl
Published January 28, 2014
Excitement continues to build around the Super Bowl coming to the New
York area. The game at MetLife Stadium will be a boon for local
businesses, with approximately $550 million expected to flow into the
region's economy.
Unfortunately, there is also a dark side to the event.
The Super Bowl has been a magnet for sex trafficking in the United
States. Each year, pimps and the women and men they've forced into
prostitution -- including many underage sex workers -- descend on the
city where the game is being played, hoping to generate new business
from the thousands of visitors who travel to it from across the country
and from around the world.
With the big kickoff just around the corner, it is imperative that all
industries connected to the event do everything possible to stop this
heinous, disturbing and illegal practice.
Fortunately, many have already committed to doing that. Law enforcement
has redoubled its efforts, the travel industry is doing its part, and
advocacy groups and religious leaders are spreading the word.
The hotel and motel industry has also taken the issue head-on. Working
together, we've reached out to the hotel-motel workforce in New York
City and New Jersey to launch a trafficking awareness campaign for tens
of thousands of Hotel and Motel Trade Council members.
This critical undertaking includes a major education initiative that
teaches hospitality workers to spot the signs of sex trafficking, and
instructs them on how to report possible incidents to law enforcement.
Hotel and motel employees will be on the front lines during this year's
Super Bowl in our fight against the sex-trafficking trade, and their
eyes and ears will be a vital component in our efforts to combat it.
According to the Center for Court Innovation-John Jay College of
Criminal Justice's joint comprehensive survey of commercially exploited
children in New York City, 45 percent of those children reported being
sexually exploited in hotels.
But managers, lobby staff, in-room workers and security and restaurant
personnel should not be the only ones on the alert. The public should
be vigilant as well.
Guests staying at hotels and motels can assist staff by reporting signs
of trafficking that they may see while walking in the halls, observing
the room next door, checking-in or checking-out, riding in elevators,
standing outside or waiting in lobbies.
Below are tips from training the materials we've distributed to hotel
workers, as prepared by the advocacy group End Child Prostitution and
Trafficking (ECPAT), that can help everyone identify and prevent sex
trafficking during the upcoming Super Bowl weekend.
A trafficker may:
Pay in cash one day at a time
Escort various men into his room and linger or watch the door until
they leave
Remove himself from operations by having adult females request rooms
or pay the bills
Be seen with a group of women (a stable)
Not leave the victim alone
Control all or most of the money and identification
Trafficking/victim interaction could include:
Victim refers to trafficker as "Daddy"
Trafficker uses derogatory slang
Trafficker has openly threatens or physically assaults the victim
Trafficker has inconsistencies in his stories
Trafficker orders adjacent rooms
Trafficker keeps late or unusual hours
Behaviors of a pimp:
Speaks for the victim
Pays in cash
Requests rooms with access to exits
Is seen with many young women, who exhibit signs of trafficking
Uses inappropriate nicknames with the victim
Waits while other men frequent the room
Is distrustful of security personnel
Does not let victim move freely on the property
Behaviors of a victim:
Little or no luggage or clothing
Seems disoriented
Does not speak freely
Dresses inappropriately for their age or the weather
Uses inappropriate sexual language for their age
Is seen with many older men
Wears clothing that is revealing or consists primarily of
undergarments
Words to listen for:
The Life
The Game
Bottom B****
Bottom Girl
Daddy
John
Track
Turnout
Square
Trick
Any of the above warning signs should immediately be reported to hotel
management.
According to ECPAT, 1.2 million children worldwide are the victims of
trafficking every year; 300,000 children in the United States are at
risk of falling victim to commercial sexual exploitation; 14,500 to
17,500 foreign nationals are trafficked into the U.S. each year; and 95
percent of all trafficking victims experience physical or sexual
violence. Sobering statistics.
However, with the help the region's hotel-motel workers and guests, we
can put up the biggest fight yet against Super Bowl-related sex
trafficking, and even use this event as a model to combat trafficking
throughout the year.
Please be alert and aware as you enjoy this year's game. As trafficking
prepares to rear its ugly head in our area, there is no doubt that by
working together, we can tackle this unspeakable horror and send a
strong message to would-be traffickers that there will be zero
tolerance for these crimes in New York.
