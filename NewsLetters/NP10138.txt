Dear Neighbors,
This week, I voted yes on H.R. 4486: Military Construction and Veterans
Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015. This bill
affects many elements of our military and Veterans Affairs, everything
from funding for Arlington National Cemetery to the Veterans Health
Administration and beyond.
Rep. Tammy Duckworth at a Veterans Roundtable in Itasca, IL
I advocated for some important provisions in this bill that includes
funding for the Veterans caregiver supporter program, support for
homeless Veterans and job training for Veterans transitioning to the
private sector.
I also encouraged the VA to strengthen collaborations with research
universities and teaching hospitals such as Rush University Medical
Center in Chicago. The partnerships will focus on the treatment and
research of mental health disorders, such as Post Traumatic Stress and
traumatic brain injury. I also asked that the VA's national
ophthalmology services be expanded to better serve Veterans with eye
injuries.
Our Veterans deserve every opportunity to achieve the American Dream
that they fought for. This legislation allows the VA to better process
Veterans' claims, address Veterans' homelessness and help those who
served successfully transition into the private sector. I want to thank
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working together to pass
this vital legislation for our nation's Veterans.
Sincerely,
Tammy Duckworth
Member of Congress
