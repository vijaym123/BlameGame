Dear Friend,
Today, our nation
commemorates the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His
sacrifice and dedication to the fight against injustice is an example we
can all strive to live up to. While today is a day for celebration of
the successes Dr. King was able to achieve for civil rights in this
country, the journey is far from over. Intolerance, injustice, and
inequality still exist in communities all across America. It is up to us to
make our voices heard and continue the journey ourselves.
Its
important to remember that in addition to being a day of reflection
and appreciation today is also a national day of service. Change does
not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through
continuous struggle, said Dr. King. We can rededicate ourselves to serving
our communities and begin taking steps to facilitate that change.
We can accomplish this in a variety of ways, whether it is
mentoring a child, donating your time to a food bank, or even something
as simple as planting a tree. The smallest personal sacrifices can
have a tremendous impact. By both remembering and serving today,
together we can walk farther along the path of justice and closer to
realizing Dr. Kings dream.
In the words of Dr. King, if I cannot do
great things, I can do small things in a great way.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd Congressional District of
Louisiana
