Lipinski
Asks New Metra Leader for Needed Improvements on BNSF, Heritage Corridor
Lines
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3)
Illinois's most senior member of the U.S. House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee and co-chair of the Congressional Public
Transportation Caucus has sent a letter to new Metra Executive Director/CEO Don
Orseno, asking him to address problems with delays on the BNSF line
and the need for increased service on the Heritage Corridor.

"Without question, the impact of the system-wide
delays this winter cannot be overstated, especially on the BNSF
line.
Unfortunately, Metra's service on the BNSF lagged throughout parts
of last year as well, Lipinski stated.
Many of my constituents
believe Metra's service along the line is slipping.
One of my
highest priorities is to ensure reliable, high quality public
transportation in northeastern Illinois.
For this reason, I urge you to
take measurable steps to improve the reliability of this
service."
Lipinski also talked with the
Joliet
Herald-News
about the need for more commuter trains on the Heritage Corridor
line.
U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Western Springs, has renewed his call for
more commuter trains on the Heritage Corridor line with Metras new
executive director.

Lipinski Responds to
Decision
to Delay Healthcare Laws Employer
Mandate
Congressman Lipinski released the
following
statement
in response to the
Administration's delay of the employer healthcare
mandate:
It is good news that the
Obama Administration has decided to further delay the employer
healthcare mandate because they see that it cannot be implemented without
harming employers and job creation, said Rep. Dan
Lipinski (IL-3).
I have had and continue to have many concerns about the
impact of the Affordable Care Act; that is why I voted against it and I
have sponsored, cosponsored, or voted for two dozen changes to the law.
It is about time that the President, along with both parties, put the
rhetoric aside and work to identify the significant problems that
still exist with the law and fix them - this is what the American people
expect of us.
I will continue to reach out to my constituents for
their input on this well-intentioned, but deeply flawed
law.

Honors a Real American Hero
Recently, Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) helped honor brave World
War II Veteran Bruno Perino, who was awarded the Knight of the Legion of
Honor Medal, the highest honor that France can bestow upon those who
have achieved remarkable deeds for France.
Mr. Perino earned
this honor for his bravery in helping to liberate France as a rifleman in
the 45 th
Division of the U.S. Army in World War II.
Lipinski joined Mr. Perinos family and members of the American Legion
Orland Memorial Post #111 for the ceremony where he presented Mr.
Perino with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.

In todays world,
we are quick to heap praise on certain individuals and label them a
hero, said Rep. Lipinski.
When talking about Bruce Perino,
hero seems like an understatement.
This humble man from Chicago
accomplished more during a few years in his youth than most people
accomplish in an entire lifetime.
I am honored to give a hero like
Bruce Perino my heartfelt thank you, both here and in the U.S.
Congress.

fields," stated Lipinski.
"America needs more engineers, and
National Engineers Week helps to provide students with opportunities to
learn more about engineering careers and get hands-on experience. I am
happy to do my part during this week to inspire more students to take
up
engineering.
