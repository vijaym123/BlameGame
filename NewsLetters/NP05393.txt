October 19, 2014
Friends,
I regularly
hold events throughout our district to meet with constituents and
discuss federal issues over a cup of coffee.
These Coffee with Your
Congressman events are open to the public.
Since I depend on
talking with constituents to hear concerns and gather feedback, these
chats are invaluable to me. This week we are doing something a little
different.
I am holding five
coffee meetings focused on veterans issues, veterans benefits, and
health care. Accompanying me at the meetings will be South Carolina
County Veterans Affairs Officers, our Seventh District Director, and
possibly representatives from Dorn VA Hospital (Columbia) and Ralph
Johnson VA Hospital (Charleston).
These meetings are open to all
Seventh District veterans, veteran family members, and veteran advocates. I
look forward to meeting with our veterans, but more importantly, I
look forward to thanking them for the sacrifices they have made for you
and me.
Please help me spread the word about these events by
forwarding this email to your
friends.

Horry
County Receives Loan Guarantee
Last week
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced $1.4
Billion in loan guarantees to rural communities in 21 states.
These
loan guarantees are to be used to improve the delivery of electric
power and enhance the quality of life in rural America.
Horry
Electric Cooperative was fortunate to receive one of USDAs loans for system
improvements and upgrades.
This loan will provide our
districts rural communities with increased access to services and make our
area safer during emergency
situations.
Friend of the
Farmers
As you know, Agriculture is a leading industry in our district and I
will continue to fight for our Palmetto State farmers.
Last week,
I was honored to receive the Friends of Farm Bureau Award for
ensuring our districts farmers have the support from the federal government
they need to be successful.
Pictured below is David Winkles
(President of South Carolina Farm Bureau), Keith Allen (owner of the farm
pictured, Betty Allen Farms in Latta SC), and Gary Spires (SC Farm
Bureau).

As your Congressman, one of my roles is to nominate young men and
