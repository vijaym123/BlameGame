Opportunity Agenda
My goal is to positively affect people's lives with a message of hope
and opportunity, and my legislative Opportunity Agenda
is a reflection of that.
I believe
that all Americans should have the chance to work hard and get ahead.
As part of the Opportunity Agenda, I have introduced the CHOICE Act,
SKILLS Act
, SEA Jobs Act
, and the LEAP Act
focusing on getting a quality education, job
training, and using our energy resources to benefit Americans.
This past week, we heard President Obama and Vice President Biden talk
a lot about strengthening job training, but what we didn't hear were
concrete ways to make the programs more efficient and responsive to
work better for people who need them.
My SKILLS Act would streamline
35 overlapping federal job training programs into one, cutting out
overhead and making the programs more responsive to the hiring
capabilities of employers.
Learn more about it here
.
Obamacare Must Go
I have been very clear from the start that this flawed legislation must
be repealed and replaced with sensible reforms.
President Obama's
nomination of Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews
Burwell to be the new Secretary of Health and Human Services will raise
tough questions. It seems unlikely that she or anyone else could clean
up the Obamacare mess we are left with now. In case you missed it, I
wrote a guest post
on RedState this past week.
I wish you and your family a wonderful Easter holiday, and as always
please feel free to contact my office with questions, suggestions, or
if we can ever be of service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
