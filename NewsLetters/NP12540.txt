Dear Friend,
As we head into February, some of the most vulnerable in our society
are facing a completely unnecessary, challenge: the loss of their
emergency unemployment benefits.
Despite House Democrats demanding action, Speaker John Boehner seems
content to sit on the sidelines while more than 1.7 million Americans,
including over 31,000 Wisconsinites, struggle to support their basic
needs. Meanwhile, each week that Congress does not act, an additional
72,000 Americans, including 1,600 Wisconsinites, will lose their
unemployment benefits.
But statistics don't tell the full story on how the loss of
unemployment benefits affects Wisconsinites on the ground. I have
received a number of phone calls and letters from constituents telling
me how this loss of unemployment insurance is affecting their daily
lives. Last week, I invited Brian Krueger, a steamfitter from Mount
Horeb, to the State of the Union Address. Brian was laid off from his
job this past June and lost unemployment insurance on December 28 when
Congress failed to extend this vital lifeline. I am hopeful that Brian's
story, and the stories of millions of out-of-work Americans from across
the country, will spur Congress to move past politics and instead
represent our constituents who are struggling just to get by.
I encourage you to listen to Brian's story in this video:
>From these stories, I know that people who are long-term unemployed
aren't looking for a handout-they are looking for a job. Instead of
focusing on making life harder for struggling Americans, like Brian,
Congress should do all that we can to promote economic growth and
encourage job creation. Know that I will not stop fighting until we
extend these important benefits and commit to supporting American
families.
Thank you,

Dear
Friend,
As
we
head
into
February,
some
of
the
most
vulnerable
in
our
society
are
facing
a
completely
unnecessary,
challenge:
the
loss
of
their
emergency
unemployment
benefits.
Despite
House
Democrats
demanding
action,
Speaker
John
Boehner
seems
content
to
sit
on
the
sidelines
while
more
than
1.7
million
Americans,
including
over
31,000
Wisconsinites,
struggle
to
support
their
basic
needs.
Meanwhile,
each
week
that
Congress
does
not
act,
an
additional
72,000
Americans,
including
1,600
Wisconsinites,
will
lose
their
unemployment
benefits.
But
statistics
don&#8217;t
tell
the
full
story
on
how
the
loss
of
unemployment
benefits
affects
Wisconsinites
on
the
ground.
I
have
received
a
number
of
phone
calls
and
letters
from
constituents
telling
me
how
this
loss
of
unemployment
insurance
is
affecting
their
daily
lives.
Last
week,
I
invited
Brian
Krueger,
a
steamfitter
from
Mount
Horeb,
to
the
State
of
the
Union
Address.
Brian
was
laid
off
from
his
job
this
past
June
and
lost
unemployment
insurance
on
December
28
when
Congress
failed
to
extend
this
vital
lifeline.
I
am
hopeful
that
Brian&#8217;s
story,
and
the
stories
of
millions
of
out-of-work
Americans
from
across
the
country,
will
spur
Congress
to
move
past
politics
and
instead
represent
our
constituents
who
are
struggling
just
to
get
by.
I
encourage
you
to
listen
to
Brian&#8217;s
story
in
this
video:
From
these
stories,
I
know
that
people
who
are
long-term
unemployed
aren&#8217;t
looking
for
a
handout&#8212;they
are
looking
for
a
job.
Instead
of
focusing
on
making
life
harder
for
struggling
Americans,
like
Brian,
Congress
should
do
all
that
we
can
to
promote
economic
growth
and
encourage
job
creation.
Know
that
I
will
not
stop
fighting
until
we
extend
these
important
benefits
and
commit
to
supporting
American
families.
Thank
you,
Mark
