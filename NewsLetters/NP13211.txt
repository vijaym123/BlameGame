Focused on Jobs
The Bureau
of Labor Statistics released its monthly jobs report on Friday
revealing that only 74,000 jobs were created last month. There was a decline
in the unemployment rate, but that was due mostly to a decline in the
labor force participation rate as more folks dropped out of the job
market altogether. These are troubling signs. We all want more of our
fellow citizens to have the opportunity to realize the pride and
increased financial security that comes with finding a job and to be able to
pursue their dreams and provide for their
families.
In the House of Representatives, we have drafted,
debated, and sent
multiple bills
over to the
Senate that would reduce barriers to job creation and promote economic
growth
including initiatives to rein in job-destroying bureaucratic
red tape and proposals to expand energy production. We have passed
common sense reforms that would make sure that when we do spend taxpayer
dollars to help folks get the skills they need to find a job, we do so
in a way that is more effective, efficient and
beneficial.
Unfortunately, the myriad of bills we
have passed are sitting idle over in the Democrat-controlled Senate where
they are focused on extending, yet again, additional emergency
unemployment benefits. Clearly our Senate colleagues believe economic
opportunity and growth is not where it should be. But right now they are not
yet prepared to work on positive solutions to improve the level of
job creation in this country and help more Americans find a job. Unless
they have actually resigned themselves to a sluggish economy as the
new normal, Democrats should join House Republicans in our fight for
policies that can build a stronger economy, one that produces more
opportunity and more jobs for more
Americans.
