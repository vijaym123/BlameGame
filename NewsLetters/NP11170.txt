March Healthcare Update
The upcoming expansion
of Medicaid in New
Hampshire and the news that signups have exceeded this year's total
goal are giant steps on the road to improving healthcare access in our
state.
With the enrollment deadline for most, March 31st, just days away, I
invite you to read and share this update about healthcare in New
Hampshire and how you can access healthcare resources. A special thank
you to constituents Jeff and Lisa for sharing their stories.
Jeff's Story
Several years ago, my wife left her job so that she could help me out
because of my disability. She subsequently started her own business
from home after that. We were carried on her COBRA for a year, and
after that, she applied for insurance through the individual market and
was accepted by Anthem, but I was not due to my pre-existing condition.
I got insurance through the NH Health Plan high-risk pool. The costs of
these two plans were killing our budget. We were paying $1,000 per
month, and our deductibles were $12,000 for my wife and $5,000 for me.
Recently, I contacted Congresswoman Shea-Porter's office to help me
resolve a few issues regarding my plan after I had enrolled online at
the Affordable Care Act's Marketplace. I spoke with Patrick, her
Constituent Services Representatives in Rochester. He was knowledgeable
about the ACA and was able to help with issues regarding my plan. I
would encourage anyone in the district who has not yet signed up for a
healthcare plan because they're not sure what to do to contact Patrick
for assistance.
My wife and I are now enrolled in a plan under the Affordable Care Act.
Our deductibles are approximately $1500 and, like many people, we
qualified for tax subsidies, so we now pay only $250 per month for
quality health insurance.
I've seen a lot of ads on TV talking about how the Affordable Care Act
isn't working, but for us, the exact opposite is true. The Affordable
Care Act gave us more health insurance options and it saved us about
$750 per month. Additionally, it allows my wife to run her own business
while still being able to help me.
I'd encourage more people to go to healthcare.gov and check out your
options. And if you need help, call Congresswoman Shea-Porter.

Getting Better
As I've always said, the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it is
a significant improvement on our old healthcare system, which was
fundamentally broken. Here's how I've been working to improve the law:
? For New Hampshire consumers
For the past year, I have been fighting to bring competition to New
Hampshire's insurance market. This week, Minuteman Health Inc, a new
health CO-OP, was issued a New Hampshire license and announced it will
offer plans in the ACA Marketplace next year. It will be joined by
Harvard Pilgrim.
Competition will benefit everyone, and will improve access to doctors
and hospitals for New Hampshire consumers. Frisbie Hospital, in my
hometown of Rochester, will be included in at least one of the networks
after being excluded this year. As the Union Leader
reported:
"We will be in the Harvard network," (Frisbie CEO) Felgar said, adding
they recently entered an agreement with the Massachusetts-based
insurance company.
Felgar said Frisbie continues to negotiate with Minuteman, which is
also based in Massachusetts...
Although Shea-Porter is a "big supporter of the ACA," Felgar said she
has been very supportive of Frisbie since she learned of the "gross
deficiency" of its exclusion from Anthem's network.
As we all know, Anthem decided, on its own, to leave some hospitals out
of their provider network in the new Marketplace, the ACA healthcare
exchange. This created a too-narrow network. While this only affects a
very small percentage of folks who are primarily new individual policy
holders, it's still unfair. So I asked the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services to start actively evaluating network adequacy. Last
month, it agreed to do that. Read more in the Union Leader
.
While it's good news that HHS will improve its oversight next year, New
Hampshire still deserves answers this year to questions about Anthem's
network adequacy. That's why I joined with Frisbie Hospital's CEO, Al
Felgar, to call for the public release of the results of the Market
Conduct Exam, a study into the adequacy of Anthem's narrow network.
In December, I asked the Department of Health and Human Services to
improve identity verification processing times and ensure the security
of consumers' personal information. I will continue working to ensure
that such information is secure.
? For New Hampshire children
and families
In January, I pressed for a fix
to
Healthcare.gov to ensure families could obtain coverage when children
had been mistakenly found eligible for Medicaid but their parents had
not. In response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services added
the option to fix errors and make changes to an application. Read more
in the Concord Monitor
.
Just last week, I joined several colleagues to alert the IRS to a
problem that has prevented access to health subsidies for victims of
domestic abuse who choose to file taxes separately from their estranged
spouses. And yesterday, the Treasury Department corrected this problem
by issuing guidance
that allows
victims to claim a premium tax credit for 2014 when filing separately
from their spouse.

Expanding Access
I'm proud that the promise of health care reform took a huge leap
forward in New Hampshire with the recent bipartisan agreement to expand
Medicaid that has now been passed by both the Senate and the House
, and was signed today
by Governor Hassan.
Expanding Medicaid is the right decision. One of the reasons I voted
for the Affordable Care Act is because I believe that no one in New
Hampshire should suffer because they can't afford health care. By
ensuring coverage for thousands of New Hampshire individuals and
families, we will improve access to healthcare and strengthen our
state's economy.
In New Hampshire, by expanding health coverage to approximately 58,000
low-income working people, we will bring an estimated $2.5 billion into
New Hampshire's economy, creating 700 jobs.
I want to thank Governor Hassan, Senate President Morse, House Speaker
Norelli, Senate Majority Leader Bradley, Senate Minority Leader Larsen,
and the many other legislators and stakeholders who brought us to this
day. Their continued commitment to work out a deal, and their refusal
to leave 58,000 Granite Staters behind, demonstrates the strength of
our state.
If you or someone you know fell into the "coverage gap" - with an
income that is too high for Medicaid and too low for premium assistance
- the best thing you can do now is contact a consumer assister to
prepare the information you will need to get covered. You can find a
consumer assister here.
_____
? For New Hampshire small
businesses
In February, I introduced the Small Business Tax Credit Accessibility
Act
with two colleagues. This
legislation would expand and simplify the healthcare law's Small
Business Health Insurance Tax Credit to help more small businesses
cover their employees.
Back in December, I led a letter to the President
urging him to allow small
employers to apply the Tax Credit to any ACA-compliant plan, whether or
not it was sold in the small business insurance Marketplace, known as
the SHOP exchange. That's because this year the SHOP did not have a
fully functional website and, in New Hampshire, only offered one plan.

A

Jeff's
Story
Several
years
ago,
my
wife
left
her
job
so
that
she
could
help
me
out
because
of
my
disability.
She
subsequently
started
her
own
business
from
home
after
that.
We
were
carried
on
her
COBRA
for
a
year,
and
after
that,
she
applied
for
insurance
through
the
individual
market
and
was
accepted
by
Anthem,
but
I
was
not
due
to
my
pre-existing
condition.
I
got
insurance
through
the
NH

of
these

and
our

I
spoke

in
Rochester.
He
was
knowledgeable
about
the
ACA
and
was
able
to
help
with
issues
regarding
my
plan.
I
would
encourage
anyone
in
the
district
who
has
not
yet
signed
up
for
a
healthcare
plan
because
they're
not
sure
what
to
do
to
contact
Patrick
for
assistance.
My
wife
and
I
are
now
enrolled
in
a

Getting
Better
As
I&#8217;ve
always
said,
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
not
perfect,
but
it
is
a
significant
improvement
on
our
old
healthcare
system,
which
was
fundamentally
broken.
Here&#8217;s
how
I&#8217;ve
been
working
to
improve
the
law:
&#9658; For
New
Hampshire
consumers
For
the
past
year,
I
have
been
fighting
to
bring
competition
to
New
Hampshire's
insurance
market.
This
week,
Minuteman
Health
Inc,
a
new
health CO-OP,
was
issued
a
New
Hampshire
license
and
announced
it
will
offer
plans
in
the
ACA
Marketplace
next
year.
It
will
be
joined
by
Harvard
Pilgrim.
Competition
will
benefit
everyone,
and
will improve
access
to
doctors
and
hospitals for New
Hampshire
consumers. Frisbie
Hospital,
in
my
hometown
of
Rochester,
will
be
included
in
at
least
one
of
the
networks
after
being
excluded
this
year.
As
the
Union
Leader
reported:
"We
will
be
in
the
Harvard
network,"
(Frisbie
CEO)
Felgar
said,
adding
they
recently
entered
an
agreement
with
the
Massachusetts-based
insurance
company.
Felgar
said
Frisbie
continues
to
negotiate
with
Minuteman,
which
is
also
based
in
Massachusetts...
Although
Shea-Porter
is
a
"big
supporter
of
the
ACA,"
Felgar
said
she
has
been
very
supportive
of
Frisbie
since
she
learned
of
the
"gross
deficiency"
of
its
exclusion
from
Anthem's
network.
As
we
all
know,
Anthem
decided,
on
its
own,
to
leave
some
hospitals
out
of
their
provider
network
in
the
new
Marketplace,
the
ACA
healthcare
exchange.
This
created
a
too-narrow
network.
While
this
only
affects
a
very
small
percentage
of
folks
who
are
primarily
new
individual
policy
holders,
it's
still
unfair.
So
I
asked
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
start
actively
evaluating
network
adequacy.
Last
month,
it
agreed
to
do
that.
Read
more
in
the
Union
Leader .
While
it&#8217;s
good
news
that
HHS
will
improve
its
oversight
next
year,
New
Hampshire
still
deserves
answers
this
year
to
questions
about
Anthem's
network
adequacy.
That&#8217;s
why
I
joined
with
Frisbie
Hospital&#8217;s
CEO,
Al
Felgar,
to
call
for
the
public
release
of
the
results
of
the
Market
Conduct
Exam,
a
study
into
the
adequacy
of
Anthem&#8217;s
narrow
network.
In
December,
I
asked
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
improve
identity
verification
processing
times
and
ensure
the
security
of
consumers&#8217;
personal
information.
I
will
continue
working
to
ensure
that
such
information
is
secure.
&#9658;
For
New
Hampshire
children
and families
In
January,
I
pressed
for
a
fix
to
Healthcare.gov
to
ensure
families
could
obtain
coverage
when
children
had
been
mistakenly
found
eligible
for
Medicaid
but
their
parents
had
not.
In
response,
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
added
the
option
to
fix
errors
and
make
changes
to
an
application.
Read
more
in
the
Concord

Just last
week,
I
joined
several
colleagues
to
alert
the
IRS
to
a
problem
that
has
prevented
access
to
health
subsidies
for
victims
of
domestic

who
choose
to
file

separately
from
their

And
yesterday,
the
Treasury

corrected
this

by
issuing
guidance
that
allows
victims
to claim
a

By

That&#8217;s
because
this

the
