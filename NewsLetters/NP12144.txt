Without a doubt, one of the top concerns I hear from folks across our
district is regarding President Obama's blatant disregard for our
nation's laws and Constitution.
I share these concerns.
Whether it is through his use of unilateral executive actions, failure
to enforce existing laws or instructing one of his agencies to assume
quasi-legislative powers, the president has shown he has little respect
for the written law or the will of the American people.
Time and time again I have spoken out against this gross usurpation of
power. And time and time again my Democratic colleagues are quick to
rush to the president's defense.
But why?
After all, while my friends on the other side of the aisle may disagree
with me on matters of policy, we are still members of the same branch
of government. They should realize that the president's bypassing of
Congress will equally marginalize both Republicans and Democrats. I
know I would be just as upset if a Republican president sought to act
in this sort of authoritarian manner.
The political reality is such that I do not expect much of an outcry
from congressional Democrats despite the president's plan to seemingly
relegate them to mere presidential cheerleaders. However their
complicity must not prevent House Republicans from acting to protect
our Constitution's separation of powers.
That is why I was proud to cosponsor the STOP Resolution. The STOP
Resolution, short for "Stop This Overreaching Presidency," directs the
House of Representatives to sue the president in D.C. federal court for
violating his presidential duties as outlined in the United States
Constitution. Once the lawsuit is filed, the court would then have the
option to void any executive action that was outside the scope of his
vested powers. Because this is a resolution - not a bill to become
public law - and it solely governs actions taken by the House of
Representatives it does not need to pass the Senate to go into effect.
I believe this is a credible plan. The Washington Times recently
reported the Obama administration has lost two-thirds of the court
cases where it has been a party. As long as Senate Majority Leader Reid
continues to block our ability to implement more aggressive measures to
hold the president accountable, the courts offer our best chance to
protect the Constitution.
However, it is not just Democrats who must get on board in helping to
stop unlawful actions taken by the president and his administration.
Republican leadership in the House must get behind these efforts as
well. Unfortunately, at times I believe the actions (or inaction) of
some of my Republican colleagues have not matched the strong rhetoric
they often use.
For example, last year I co-introduced introduce articles of
impeachment against Attorney General Eric Holder for refusing to comply
with a congressional subpoena and perjuring himself before the House
Judiciary Committee. These are both impeachable offenses and make the
attorney general ineligible to serve as our nation's chief law
enforcement officer.
Unfortunately, these articles of impeachment have not been brought to a
vote despite the overwhelming evidence Attorney General Holder broke
the law. I suspect that there are those in my party who have
reservations about pursuing these articles for fear of media backlash
and blocked them from receiving proper consideration.
But electoral politics should never trump doing what is right. When
members of the president's cabinet break the law, there can be no room
for compromise. They must be held responsible regardless of perceived
political consequences.
My hope is that the House leadership will quickly bring the STOP
resolution to a vote in the United States House of Representatives.
While it may not solve all of our problems, it is an important first
step and will have an immediate effect.
We must do everything in our power to preserve the integrity of our
constitutional separation of powers. Failing to do so will set a
precedent that will have long-term repercussions and upset the very
principles this country was founded. America is not a dictatorship.
Generations of brave men and women have fought and died to maintain the
freest nation in the world. Now it is our turn. If we do not stop this
president's encroachment of the people's power, then who will?

Without
a
doubt,
one
of
the
top
concerns
I
hear
from
folks
across
our
district
is
regarding
President
Obama&#8217;s
blatant
disregard
for
our
nation&#8217;s
laws
and
Constitution.
I
share
these
concerns.
Whether
it
is
through
his
use
of
unilateral
executive
actions,
failure
to
enforce
existing
laws
or
instructing
one
of
his
agencies
to
assume
quasi-legislative
powers,
the
president
has
shown
he
has
little
respect
for
the
written
law
or
the
will
of
the
American
people.
Time
and
time
again
I
have
spoken
out
against
this
gross
usurpation
of
power.
And
time
and
time
again
my
Democratic
colleagues
are
quick
to
rush
to
the
president&#8217;s
defense.
But
why?
After
all,
while
my
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
may
disagree
with
me
on
matters
of
policy,
we
are
still
members
of
the
same
branch
of
government.
They
should
realize
that
the
president&#8217;s
bypassing
of
Congress
will
equally
marginalize
both
Republicans
and
Democrats.
I
know
I
would
be
just
as
upset
if
a
Republican
president
sought
to
act
in
this
sort
of
authoritarian
manner.
The
political
reality
is
such
that
I
do
not
expect
much
of
an
outcry
from
congressional
Democrats
despite
the
president&#8217;s
plan
to
seemingly
relegate
them
to
mere
presidential
cheerleaders.
However
their
complicity
must
not
prevent
House
Republicans
from
acting
to
protect
our
Constitution&#8217;s
separation
of
powers.
That
is
why
I
was
proud
to
cosponsor
the
STOP
Resolution.
The
STOP
Resolution,
short
for
&#8220;Stop
This
Overreaching
Presidency,&#8221;
directs
the
House
of
Representatives
to
sue
the
president
in
D.C.
federal
court
for
violating
his
presidential
duties
as
outlined
in
the
United
States
Constitution.
Once
the
lawsuit
is
filed,
the
court
would
then
have
the
option
to
void
any
executive
action
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
his
vested
powers.
Because
this
is
a
resolution
&#8211;
not
a
bill
to
become
public
law
&#8211;
and
it
solely
governs
actions
taken
by
the
House
of
Representatives
it
does
not
need
to
pass
the
Senate
to
go
into
effect.
I
believe
this
is
a
credible
plan.
The
Washington
Times
recently
reported
the
Obama
administration
has
lost
two-thirds
of
the
court
cases
where
it
has
been
a
party.
As
long
as
Senate
Majority
Leader
Reid
continues
to
block
our
ability
to
implement
more
aggressive
measures
to
hold
the
president
accountable,
the
courts
offer
our
best
chance
to
protect
the
Constitution.
However,
it
is
not
just
Democrats
who
must
get
on
board
in
helping
to
stop
unlawful
actions
taken
by
the
president
and
his
administration.
Republican
leadership
in
the
House
must
get
behind
these
efforts
as
well.
Unfortunately,
at
times
I
believe
the
actions
(or
inaction)
of
some
of
my
Republican
colleagues
have
not
matched
the
strong
rhetoric
they
often
use.
For
example,
last
year
I
co-introduced
introduce
articles
of
impeachment
against
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
for
refusing
to
comply
with
a
congressional
subpoena
and
perjuring
himself
before
the
House
Judiciary
Committee.
These
are
both
impeachable
offenses
and
make
the
attorney
general
ineligible
to
serve
as
our
nation&#8217;s
chief
law
enforcement
officer.
Unfortunately,
these
articles
of
impeachment
have
not
been
brought
to
a
vote
despite
the
overwhelming
evidence
Attorney
General
Holder
broke
the
law.
I
suspect
that
there
are
those
in
my
party
who
have
reservations
about
pursuing
these
articles
for
fear
of
media
backlash
and
blocked
them
from
receiving
proper
consideration.
But
electoral
politics
should
never
trump
doing
what
is
right.
When
members
of
the
president&#8217;s
cabinet
break
the
law,
there
can
be
no
room
for
compromise.
They
must
be
held
responsible
regardless
of
perceived
political
consequences.
My
hope
is
that
the
House
leadership
will
quickly
bring
the
STOP
resolution
to
a
vote
in
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives.
While
it
may
not
solve
all
of
our
problems,
it
is
an
important
first
step
and
will
have
an
immediate
effect.
We
must
do
everything
in
our
power
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
our
constitutional
separation
of
powers.
Failing
to
do
so
will
set
a
precedent
that
will
have
long-term
repercussions
and
upset
the
very
principles
this
country
was
founded.
America
is
not
a
dictatorship.
Generations
of
brave
men
and
women
have
fought
and
died
to
maintain
the
freest
nation
in
the
world.
Now
it
is
our
turn.
If
we
do
not
stop
this
president&#8217;s
encroachment
of
the
people&#8217;s
power,
then
who
will?
