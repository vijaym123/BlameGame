Friend,
I hope you&#39;re having a great
Tuesday
so far and that you enjoyed this morning&#39;s poem.
Our team is excited and the office is buzzing-- voters all across California are casting their ballots.
Today&#39;s primary election also means that the books on our primary account close tonight at
midnight . Can you pitch in $5 or more?

Thanks again,
