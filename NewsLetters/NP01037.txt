Dear
Friend,
Hall County's
unemployment rate was the
lowest in Georgia in March .
One reason for the area's success is Lake Lanier, which draws 8 million
visitors and adds $300 million to the local economy every year. Last
week,
I visited the Olympic Venue there
at Clarks
Bridge Park.
Gainesville Mayor Danny
Dunagan, State Rep. Lee Hawkins, County Commissioner Scott Gibbs, local
architects Robin and Matt Millard, champion rower Morgan House, as well
as Mimi Collins, Chairwoman of Gainesville-Hall '96, joined me to
discuss ways to improve the site and attract even more jobs and growth to
the Ninth District, an increasingly popular tourist
destination.
Viewing
plans for Lake Lanier's Olympic
Venue
Not only do we have a piece of Georgia's Olympic history,
where rowing teams from around the world practice and compete, Northeast
Georgia is also home to the country's second largest man-made lake
east of the Mississippi River -- Lake Hartwell. I was recently there too,
learning more about the vibrant lake economy that the Ninth District
shares with neighboring South Carolina.
Across our district, local governments work with the Army Corps of
Engineers, which helped to create these valuable resources, to preserve
and improve them. In Congress, I launched the Army Corps of Engineers
Caucus to increase the agency's responsiveness and efficiency, so that
it may better serve new arrivals, who visit Northeast Georgia for its
natural beauty and
stay for its residents' warmth and
hospitality.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
