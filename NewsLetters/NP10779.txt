Top Obamacare Official Steps Down
Chuck Fleischmann grills Secretary Sebelius at committee hearing
Secretary Sebelius is finally stepping down from her position atop the
agency in charge of Obamacare.
All I can say is, it's about time.
Obamacare has been a disaster for the American people, and Secretary
Sebelius has played a large role in that disaster.
In fact, just over
two weeks ago, she lied to Congress and the American people when asked
about potential Obamacare delays.
This certainly does not end our fight against Obamacare, but it is a
step in the right direction.
I am hopeful that the Administration's
choice for a replacement will, at the very least, be truthful.
Sincerely,
