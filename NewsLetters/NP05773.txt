The separation of church and state was never intended to morph into the silencing of church and state.
Our country was founded on freedom
of
religion, not freedom
from
religion. I remain committed to preserving every Americans constitutionally protected right to live out their faith; whether that is how they run their business, how they raise their children, or what healthcare plan they choose. Learn more about my work,

Yours in service,
Randy
