Celebrating National Agriculture Week
This week is National Agriculture Week. Agriculture is a key component of Michigans economy, supporting more than 920,000 jobs and contributing more than $101 billion annually to the states economy. Michigan is also home to 52,200 farms, covering nearly 10 million acres of farmland. Please join me in thanking Michigan farmers for all they do to provide an abundant, healthy food supply.
