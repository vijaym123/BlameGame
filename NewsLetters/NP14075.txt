Dear Friends,
This week I sent another letter
to Secretary of
State John Kerry seeking an explanation as to why a Reward for Justice
the State Department says it offered to help capture the Benghazi
terrorists has gone unacknowledged and unpublicized for nearly a year.
The State Department did not even reveal its existence until last week
in response to my initial letter
inquiring about the use of the program.
I continue to encourage Speaker Boehner to call a Select Committee on
Benghazi and urge the State Department to do everything in its power to
apprehend the terrorists responsible. The American people deserve to
know what happened that tragic day and I will not rest until they do.
This week the House voted on and passed three bipartisan energy bills
designed to streamline and expand domestic energy production while
creating jobs. Not only does increased domestic energy production mean
lower costs for families, but it is also improves national security.
The less we depend on foreign energy, the better off our country will
be.
On Thursday I led a congressional delegation to Mexico City to meet
with the Mexican Congress.
As Chairman of the Inter Parliamentary
Group I will be leading bilateral discussions on securing both sides of
our border and on energy security.
Finally, with the holiday season upon us, Linda, the kids and I want to
wish you and your families a blessed and Happy Thanksgiving.
