More Congressional
Subpoenas Ignored by the Obama
Administration
9/12/14
This week in a House Natural Resources
Committee, Congressman Doug Lamborn grilled the Department of the
Interior's Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall. Deputy IG Kendall has
failed to fully respond to lawful Congressional subpoenas and has misled
the committee in previous
testimony.
"The time for talking is over. Deputy
IG Kendall should be held in contempt of Congress for failing to
fully comply with our subpoenas. Members of Congress are representatives
of the American people, sent to Washington to exercise our
Constitutional role in overseeing the executive branch of the government. When
executive branch officials do not cooperate, they are denying American
citizens their Constitutional rights. It is past time for credibility to
be restored and that will require new leaders and employees in the
Inspector General's
office."

Background Information from the House Natural Resources
Committee
Since 2011, the Committee has conducted oversight on the Obama
Administrations rewrite of a coal production regulation, the 2008
Stream Buffer Zone Rule.
Shortly after taking office, the Obama
Administration discarded the 2008 rule that went through five years of
extensive public comment and environmental review.
Since then, the
Administration has spent over $10 million taxpayer dollars working to
rewrite this rule, including hiring new contractors, only to dismiss
those same contractors once it was publicly revealed that the
Administrations proposed regulation could cost 7,000 jobs and cause economic
harm in 22 states.
Committee investigations have exposed gross
mismanagement of the rulemaking process, potential political
interference, and widespread economic harm the proposed regulation would
cause.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Interior Office of Inspector
General (OIG) released a report with similar findings, including
significant on-going problems with the rulemaking process. However, the OIG
is refusing to disclose these problems to Congress. For example,
theres an entire section of the report entitled Issues with the New
Contract that has been almost completely blacked out. The Committee has
made multiple requests, including the issuance of a subpoena, for the
unredacted copy of the report and related documents.
According to
Deputy Inspector General Kendall, the unredacted report is being
withheld from the Committee at the request of the Department of the
Interior.
