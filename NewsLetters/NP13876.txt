Dear Friends,
An old hymn tells us to
'Count your many
blessings...'
and that small exercise will quickly reminds us
that we truly do have much to be thankful for.
Families, friends and neighbors are
uppermost on my list.
And I'm so grateful to live in the
greatest state
in the best nation in the world.
I'm also extraordinarily thankful for
the men and women in uniform who sacrifice so much to protect us each
day.
Many of them are away from their families today , so
please remember them in your prayers.
There are also many in our nation who are struggling, and
I encourage you to reach out to those in need this season and
let
them know that they live in a country full of compassionate
people.
I know that
many of you will be busy today, spending time with family and friends,
sharing laughter and tears, and hopefully a lot of good food.
If you have one minute,
please watch the short video we put together talking about all that I am
thankful for this year.
On behalf of my family and staff, I want
to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving!
One of my greatest blessings
is to represent you in Washington and I am forever grateful for the
trust you continue to place in me.
