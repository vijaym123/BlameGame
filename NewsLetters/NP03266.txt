Friends,
Yesterday, I voted for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015, which prohibits taxpayer funded abortion. This legislation is especially meaningful to me because my days working to protect and promote innocent life go back many years. From the time that my wife Julie was the president and founder of the Gordon County chapter of Georgia Right to Life to my first floor speech in the Georgia General Assembly. And I'm proud to say that nothing has changed. My vote for this legislation is a vote to protect unborn lives, and the conscience of millions of people around the country who, like me, believe every unborn baby has the right to life.
Congress is Coming to You
Constituent services is one of the most important aspects of my congressional office, and the County Connection Program is a critical part of these efforts. The County Connection Program brings Congress to every county in the 14th District (besides Floyd and Whitfield, where my permanent offices are located), and gives people who may not live near my permanent offices the ability to meet with my staff at a location closer to their home. Whether its an issue with the VA, Social Security, Medicare or any other federal program or agency, my staff will be prepared to help. Click

Graves says Obamas plans lack realistic funding methods
District 14 U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Calhoun, said some of President Barack Obama's plans for helping "certain groups of people by expanding the federal government with an action, a program or an initiative" in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night did not include "realistic" ways to fund them.
