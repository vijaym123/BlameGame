Dear Friends,
On
Friday, August 1,
I moved to the Johns Hopkins Outpatient
Center
where I am continuing radiation and chemotherapy as well
as speech and mobility rehabilitation for several more weeks.
Two
months after surgery, I am happy to be in the outpatient phase of
recovery.
Tori and I
have been overwhelmed and humbled by the outpouring of
support over the last several months.
Thank
you.
I Thessalonians 5:18 says, "give thanks in all
circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
Through the entire process of being diagnosed with a brain tumor and
having surgery to remove it, I have learned the power of the attitude of
thanksgiving.
I knew
recovery from surgery was going to be challenging, but nothing could have
prepared me for what has been difficult stroke rehabilitation.
On June 9, during the surgery to remove the tumor, I suffered a stroke
that left me with impaired speech and weakness on my left side.
In spite of the stroke and its consequences, the surgery was
successful.
I am glad the scripture in Thessalonians does not say to
give thanks
for
all circumstances because I would have a
difficult time being thankful for a tumor or a stroke, much less both.
I have learned the way to approach the difficulty of stroke
rehabilitation is to give thanks
in
all
circumstances.
I am thankful for a loving and
merciful God who has sustained and nourished me through His word.
He
has given me peace that passes all understanding, courage to face each
day and the strength to endure the strenuous course of rehabilitation
I have been on.
I am
thankful to be walking this path holding the hand of my bride of 32
years.
I cannot imagine going through this trauma and recovery without
Tori by my side cheering me on.
She has been my private nurse, a
faithful friend, healthcare advocate and a source of comfort.
Her
positive can-do attitude keeps me
motivated.
I am thankful for family and friends who
encourage me with their favorite prayers and favorite scriptures.
I
also appreciate the phone calls, cards, flowers, emails, text messages
and visits - your presence in my life is
humbling.
I am thankful for other men and women who have
walked a similar road of rehabilitation like Senator Mark Kirk and Bill
Hawks, who have reached out to encourage me.
Their personal
triumph inspires me to keep working through the difficulty of intensive
occupational speech and physical
therapy.
I am thankful for a team of very talented and
caring medical professionals who have worked cohesively to help me gain
back my speech and mobility.
I am thankful for the dedicated and talented men and
women on my congressional staff.
Their loyalty to the people we
serve is so evident by their continual attention to and support of the
issues that affect Mississippians.
They have kept me informed,
have sought my counsel and have faithfully communicated with me during
my illness.
My team understands how thankful I am to represent
the First Congressional District of Mississippi.
I am thankful to have your
encouragement and understanding as I get well.
Rather than continually asking the question, "why did this
happen to me," an attitude of thanksgiving allows me to approach the hard
work of stroke recovery with resolve and
determination.
I am thankful in this circumstance
and pray you find yourself doing the
same.
Stay in touch and God
bless,
Tell a Friend
