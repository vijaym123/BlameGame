During an
interview
last weekend, the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees both said that they do not believe our nation is safer than it was two years ago.
As they note, groups around the world are growing more hostile toward the United States, and dangerous technology is becoming more readily available to terrorists.
In order to combat these threats, we must maintain our technological and innovative advantage, ensuring that we have the resources and tools necessary to keep our law enforcement and the intelligence community safe, so they can keep us secure.
As House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-MI) said, The pressures on our intelligence services to get it right, to prevent an attack, are enormous.
Particularly in a post-9/11 world, the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that the intelligence community is taking appropriate action to root out threats to the security of the American people, but must do so within the boundaries of the U.S. Constitution.
