Friend --
I&rsquo;ve come to learn firsthand that at a fundamental level, Republicans don&rsquo;t like government. But they have to run for office so that they can take control and stop the government from working.
It&rsquo;s what I call the &ldquo;Republican paradox.&rdquo; You can see the effects of it at work in the House. And if this year goes the wrong way,
the Senate could end up just as bad. If we&rsquo;re going to keep fighting for progress, we need to keep hitting our goals. And this month, we&rsquo;ve got the FEC Pre-General filing deadline coming up early -- on October 15th. We need to hit $8O,OOO by then. Can you help us get there?

Republicans these days are working for their special interest friends -- people like the billionaire Koch brothers who deny climate change and pollute to their hearts&rsquo; content.
The GOP isn&rsquo;t working for middle class families. You know how I can tell? Because they&rsquo;d rather shut down the government than end subsidies for big oil companies. They&rsquo;d rather block legislation than make any kind of progress on gun safety, or equal pay, or raising the federal minimum wage. Republicans don&rsquo;t want government to work.
One of the reasons I ran for Senate was because they had turned the House into a dysfunctional mess. And right now, all of the pundits are giving the GOP the edge when it comes to taking charge of the Senate, too. I don&rsquo;t want to imagine what will happen if Republicans win this year. If we&rsquo;re going to stop it, we need to reach $8O,OOO by the FEC Pre-General filing deadline. Help us keep up the fight with a $5 contribution.
This November, let&rsquo;s make sure the Senate stays in the hands of the party dedicated to progress.
Thank you for your help today.
