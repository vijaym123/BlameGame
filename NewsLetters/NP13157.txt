Third District is blessed with more than our share of outstanding young
men and women with the qualifications and the desire to serve our
country.
Each year, I have the privilege of nominating a few of them
to four of our nations five service academies.
This weekend, I
had the opportunity to interview this years applicants at my Third
District Service Academies Interview Board .
Myoffice will
begin accepting applications for Service Academy class of 2019
nominations later this year.

This Tuesday, the House voted to
establish a quorum and began the second session of the 113th
Congress.
Already, we have a full plate and are quickly getting to work on
appropriations for both the remainder of fiscal year (FY) 2014 and FY
2015, as well as must-pass legislation like the farm bill.
Rest
assured that as we start this new year, House Republicans will
continue to focus on solutions to put people back to work, spur economic
growth, and give everyone a fair shot because stagnant job growth,
skyrocketing health care costs, and more broken promises are not what
hardworking Americans deserve.
On Wednesday, the House considered and passed H.R. 724 to amend the
Clean Air Act to remove the requirement for dealer certification of
new light-duty motor vehicles, H.R. 3527, the Poison Center Network
Act, and H.R. 3628, the Transportation Reports Elimination Act, under
suspension of the rules.
You can find out more about these bills
here .
In addition to these suspensions, the House passed
H.R. 2279 , the
Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of
2013 , on Thursday.
The bill allows the EPA to review
regulations on solid waste disposal only when necessary instead of
requiring the agency to review them every three years.
It also ensures
meaningful state participation in the hazardous waste cleanup process
and that federal facilities are treated in the same manner as
non-federal facilities during such cleanups.
An estimated 26 million individuals will access Healthcare.gov
the
federally run health insurance exchange
to purchase
Obamacare-mandated
health insurance coverage.
However, cybersecurity
attacks pose a serious risk to both our personal information and information
vital to our national security, and it is imperative that the
government ensures that their personal information is secure.
As you
know, there have been significant concerns raised about the integrity
and security of the sites data hub, which will receive the sensitive
personal information of those applying for insurance, and I
wholeheartedly believe that if consumers' personal info is compromised, they
should be notified.
This is why I was proud to cosponsor
H.R. 3811 , the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act
of 2014, which passed the House today by a vote of 291-122.
H.R.
3811 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to notify
individuals, within two business days, of a breach of any security
system maintained by a federal or state exchange that is known to have
resulted in personally identifiable information being stolen or
unlawfully accessed.
Next week, in addition
to suspensions, the House will consider H.R. 3622, the Exchange
Information Disclosure Act .
The House will also work on legislation that funds
the government for the remainder of FY 2014.
You may recall that
the
Bipartisan Budget Act
which was signed into
law on December 26, 2013, and established the top line discretionary
spending levels for FY 2014 and 2015 and reduced the deficit by $23
billion by identifying deficit saving proposals that include mandatory
savings and non-tax revenues
requires Congress to get back to regular
order and finish FY 2014 appropriations by January 15,
2014.
It is important to
understand the significance of returning to regular order.
The
federal government has been operating under continuing resolutions (CR) for
far too long.
Operating under CRs is incredibly
inefficient.
Moreover, it is an abdication of Congresss constitutional
responsibility.
By not passing annual appropriations bills and running
the government on CRs, Congress is ceding its authority to the
administration and allowing President Obama, his cabinet members, and agency
heads to determine where and how they spend appropriated funds.
The agreement puts Congress back in control of the purse strings, which
is what our founders intended.
From the
Front...
