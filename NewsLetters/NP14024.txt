Dear Friend,
Small businesses have been the foundation of our communities since our nation&rsquo;s beginning, and today they are a driving force behind our economy. Small businesses in New Mexico are almost 96 percent of our state&rsquo;s employers, and employ over half of our private-sector workforce.
That's why I
co-sponsored a resolution
in the Senate to designate the Saturday after Thanksgiving &mdash; Nov. 30, 2013 &mdash; as Small Business Saturday. It's a day to support the family- and locally owned businesses that keep New Mexico's Main Streets strong.
I've had the pleasure of visiting a lot of small businesses this year in New Mexico. Businesses like
bigbyte.cc , which is providing incubator space to grow our state's high-tech workforce;
Solano's Boot and Western Wear
in Raton, which has been providing quality service in Northeastern New Mexico for more than 50 years; and
El Dorado Biofuels , which is developing "Jalgae" to help fuel our transportation needs with home grown resources right here in New Mexico.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I'm working hard
to implement policies
that create opportunities for small businesses to grow, get access to capital and hire new workers, and I'm proud to be doing this on a bipartisan basis.
We can all play a part in helping New Mexico's business community prosper. To show your support, I hope you'll consider supporting a small business in your community this weekend. You can help right now by spreading the word on
Facebook , or on
Twitter .
I wish all New Mexicans a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving and &mdash; for our small business owners, a prosperous Small Business Saturday.
Cheers,
Tom Udall
United States Senator
