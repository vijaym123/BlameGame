Greetings,
The House and Senate sent a strong, unified signal to the world on Thursday by passing legislation to prevent terrorists from entering the United States as United Nations ambassadors.
This is a great moment of clarity and unity from Congress on the question of Iran, and I hope the President agrees and signs the bill immediately.
Please keep reading for a further update on the latest in the Senate.
All the best,
Ted Cruz

On Thursday, Sen. Cruz and Congressman Doug Lamborn, CO-05, called for President Obama to immediately sign into law their bipartisan legislation to prevent terrorists from getting visas to enter the United States as United Nations ambassadors.
&ldquo;Congress has voted unanimously in support of a bill to reject Iran's deliberately insulting nomination of a known terrorist &ndash; one of the 1979 hostage-takers &ndash; to be their ambassador to the United Nations,&rdquo; said Sen. Cruz. &ldquo;I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting it, and urge the President to act quickly. We, as a country, can send an unequivocal message to rogue nations like Iran that the United States will not tolerate this kind of provocative and hostile behavior."

From the interview:
Regarding U.N. Ambassador Bill:
&ldquo;This is a moment of unity and clarity on Iran&hellip; I am proud that the United States Senate in a bipartisan fashion passed legislation that I introduced 100 to zero&hellip; we said we are not going to tolerate this insult from Iran.&rdquo;
Regarding Income Inequality:
&ldquo;All the smoke and mirrors of the White House are designed to distract&hellip; women are being hurt by the Obama economy.&rdquo;
Sen. Cruz Attends Armed Service Committee Hearing

On Tuesday, Sen. Cruz attended the Armed Service committee hearing and asked Gens. Raymond Odierno, Frank Grass, and Jeffrey Talley about proposed military reductions. Below are a few key points:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to start by making a comment about the brave men and women at Fort Hood. I was visiting with the heroes last week and as tragic as the shooting was, being down there was inspirational&hellip; One young solider had been shot twice and was recuperating&hellip; and this young soldier leaned forward and said, &lsquo;I want to be a Ranger.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a powerful testament to the extraordinary men and women who serve in our Army and in the military.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask a question on the Army proposal to reduce its active duty and strength after more than a decade of war&hellip; there will be some soldiers who under the current plan will not be able to reenlist or stay in active duty, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense for the nation if we could find places for the soldiers in the national guard?&rdquo;
