LOUISIANA ELECTION RESULTS: Mary Landrieu (D) 42.08% - Bill Cassidy (R) 40.96%
Friend -- There&rsquo;s still one more Senate seat up for grabs!
Since neither Mary Landrieu nor her Tea Party opponent got to 50% of the vote on November 4, they&rsquo;ll go head-to-head in a runoff election THIS SATURDAY.
Here&rsquo;s the good news: Mary was the front-runner in the general election. But to win, we need to knock on every single door and mobilize every single Democrat.
Will you pitch in to support Mary&#39;s campaign before Saturday&#39;s election?

The new Republican Senate majority -- purchased by the Kochs and led by Mitch McConnell -- will be a disaster for middle class families.
The best thing we can do to win the White House and Senate in 2016 is to win this election and take the momentum into our own hands.
We need every single Democrat on board!
Will you pitch in to help Mary win? Remember: The election is this Saturday!
