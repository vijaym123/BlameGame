Facts on Ebola
By now you have heard so much about Ebola, we want to
make sure you have the facts. While there is a public health crisis in
west Africa (and we are working with other countries to end it),
there is not an Ebola crisis in the United States. So far, only four
people in the United States have been diagnosed with Ebola
a traveler
from Liberia, two nurses who cared for him at a Dallas hospital and a
doctor from New York who cared for Ebola patients in west Africa. It is
also important to know those infected with Ebola cant spread the
disease until symptoms appear and its only spread through direct contact
with blood and bodily fluids.
Please click
here to see a complete guide about Ebola on my
website .
But many of you might be wondering what you can do right now to
protect your health?
Go get a Flu shot .
Every year
approximately 36,000 Americans die of the Flu. As it gets colder in
our community that shot will definitely help you stay
healthy.
Medicare Enrollment
Staying on the topic
of health, it is open enrollment season for Medicare. If you are on
Medicare, you have between now and December 7 th
to enroll or
change your Part D plan.
If you have questions about switching
in or out of a Medicare Advantage Plan you can call SHIP (Senior
Health Insurance Program) at 1-800-548-9034 and they can guide you
through the process.
However, it is very important that if
you have prescription drug coverage through a Part D plan, you should
take time to review your options because the plans can change the drugs
they cover, cost-sharing requirements, and pharmacy
access.

to learn more about what has changed
this year, (courtesy of the
Medicare Rights
Center ). Once you have selected your plan you can call 800-MEDICARE or
visit
www.medicare.gov
to enroll.
If you have
questions, please feel free to contact my office at 773-506-7100 and
ask for Kris Sadur to make sure you are in a Part D plan that covers
your prescription drugs.
No Increase in Medicare 2015 Part B Premiums
Medicare has just announced that the basic
Part B monthly premium will remain $104.90 next year, and the Part B
deductible will also stay the same at $147.
The Part A
hospital/mental health inpatient deductible will be $1260 in 2015.
Social
Security/COLA
The 2015 cost-of-living
adjustment (COLA) for Social Security will be 1.7%.
I believe that is
too low and doesnt reflect the higher out-of-pocket costs that seniors
face for items like prescription drugs.
That is why I am a
cosponsor of H.R. 1030, the Consumer Price Index for Elderly Seniors Act,
which would increase the COLA by using a more accurate
formula.
