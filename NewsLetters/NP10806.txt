Senate Approves 5-month
extension of UI by a vote of 59 to 38
Last night, the Senate approved bi-partisan
legislation to extend the federal emergency unemployment insurance
program.
Action now shifts to the U.S. House of Representatives where
Rep. Levin stated, 100 days of inaction have passed while Americans
looking for work are struggling to stay in their homes, hold onto their
cars and feed their families.
House Republicans asked for the UI
extension to be paid for, and it is.
They waited until
legislation passed the Senate, and it has.
No more excuses.
The
time for action is
now.
St. Clair Shores Woman Featured in National
Radio Story
Josie Maisano, from St. Clair Shores, was featured in a national radio
interview on the need to extend the federal emergency unemployment
insurance (UI program).
She articulates what is the reality for
millions of Americans today:
She is tirelessly looking for a job
and desperately trying to keep her life above water without any help
from the UI program for over 100 days.
In response, Rep. Levin
states, If we can't respond to people who have worked in many cases all
their lives and who are desperately looking for work, I just feel that
personally we've failed.

Levin:
GOP Budget Ends Medicare
Program as We Know It
The House will spend much of this week debating the Republican
Budget Resolution authored by Representative Paul Ryan.
The
GOP budget is controversial because it would transform the time-tested
Medicare guarantee into a voucher program.
The Ryan budget also
repeals the Affordable Care Act, kicking millions of Americans off
their health care plans, and slashes hundreds of billions of dollars
from key domestic investments like education, job training,
infrastructure, and medical research.
At the same time, the GOP budget cuts
taxes for the wealthiest taxpayers.
Rep. Levin had this to say about the GOP budget:
As a framework for the American peoples future the Republican Budget
fails.
It ends the Medicare program as we know it, destroys the
fabric of programs that bolster low- and middle-income families and
adopts a tax structure that would help the very wealthy at the expense of
the middle class.
At a time when our economy needs us to stick
to a path of investment and smart fiscal restraint the Republican
budget makes so many wrong choices and would set our economy
back.
April 8 is Equal Pay Day
More than 50 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act,
women continue to be paid less for performing the same job as their
male colleagues.
Women are nearly half of the workforce, but still
earn just 77 cents, on average, for every dollar earned by a
man.
Equal Pay Day falls on
April 8 this year.
The date symbolizes when
more than 3 months
into the year
womens wages finally catch up to what men were paid in
the previous year.
Rep. Levin and more than 200 other
concerned lawmakers have cosponsored The Paycheck Fairness Act.
The bill
[H.R. 377]
builds on the landmark Equal
Pay Act signed into law in 1963 by closing loopholes that have kept the
Act from achieving its goal of equal pay for equal work.
The
bill would require employers to show pay disparity is truly related to
job-performance
not
gender.
Healthy
Michigan
On April 1, the process of
extending health care coverage to as many as 470,000 people began in
Michigan.
Healthy Michigan, the Medicaid expansion authorized by the
Affordable Care Act, will cover those whose incomes fall under 133% of
poverty level.
Healthy Michigan will allow more adults to receive
essential health care coverage like wellness visits, chronic disease
management, mental health treatment and emergency
services.
The application is now available
online, by phone and in-person. Offices for the Michigan Department
of Human Services will offer extend hours during the first days of
enrollment and phone lines will open from 8 a.m. to
midnight.
