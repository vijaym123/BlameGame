As top Democratic Senator Patty Murray said, a $12/hour minimum wage &ldquo;is a key piece of our work to grow the economy from the middle out, not the top down...
No one who works hard in a full-time job should have to live in poverty.&rdquo;
We couldn&rsquo;t agree more! This is Democrats&rsquo; vision for America --
and now it&rsquo;s on us to work together to make it happen.
Will you add your name to stand with Democrats for a $12 minimum wage?
