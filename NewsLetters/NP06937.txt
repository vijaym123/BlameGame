Dear Friend,
Our men and women in uniform risk their lives to protect the freedoms we all hold dear. Tragically, after returning to civilian life, far too many brave Hoosier veterans fall into homelessness, living on the street or in a shelter. Fortunately, a program in Marion County is working to change that.
This week, I was honored to team up with the Habitat for Humanity of Greater Indianapolis to let local veterans know about affordable home ownership opportunities.
With the help of donors and volunteers, veterans can own a Habitat home for an average mortgage of $400.00 a month depending on the size of the house.
I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to say thank you to a service member than providing them with affordable housing.
Please share this information with your family and friends, as well as in your neighborhood.

Sincerely,
Andr&eacute;

Last week, I issued a statement in response to the tragic events taking place in Ferguson, Missouri.
&ldquo;It is my hope that as the family of Michael Brown comes to terms with their terrible loss, communities across America will honor his memory by ensuring our country&rsquo;s children of color are protected equally under the law. I know the struggle for peace and justice matters to every American, just as it does to the community of Ferguson.
As a former police officer, I also know that law enforcement is supposed to protect and serve, not intimidate and assault.
Our nation has a rich history of peaceful protests to advance civil and human rights&mdash;these voices are too valuable to be silenced by violence and the use of unnecessary and excessive force.&rdquo;
