Dear Friend,
As
the weather finally starts to warm, things are heating up in
Washington so I wanted to lay out some of my 2014 priorities for
you.
This week we fired back at the corruption in the IRS by passing a bill
entitled: Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act. This
legislation will protect your right to free political speech, regardless
of political affiliation.
I also recently spent time in
Texas visiting our nations next generation of leaders as well as our
current heroes!
To learn more about each of these topics click on
the links below! I also want to get your opinion so be sure to answer
the poll question on the right.
Standing up for you in
2014!
Barton votes to stop
