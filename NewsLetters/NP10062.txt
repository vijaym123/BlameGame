Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Congratulations to California Chrome on winning the 140th Kentucky
Derby! What an exciting race! What a wonderful way to showcase
Kentucky's signature equine industry on the world's stage.
It was a busy week in Congress and I appreciate the opportunity to
update you about my work on behalf of all the people of Kentucky's
Sixth District!
House Passes My Commonsense Solution to Help Create Kentucky Jobs
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed my bipartisan,
commonsense fix to a real-world problem voiced by community banks and
employers in Kentucky.
H.R. 4167, the Restoring Proven Financing for American Employers Act,
was passed by a voice vote and would ensure that U.S. employers are
able to obtain affordable financing to expand their businesses and
create jobs for Kentuckians.
I am glad that it included significant bipartisan input from Democratic
members of the House Committee on Financial Services, passing out of
the Committee in March by a vote of 53-3, and passing the full House by
a bipartisan voice vote.
I appreciate the support of Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) and
Congressman Patrick Murphy (D-FL) in passing this legislation and hope
that we can continue to reach across the aisle for commonsense
compromise.

Celebrating Kentucky's Signature Horse Industry
Last week, I spoke on the House floor about the men and women who
dedicate their lives to Kentucky's signature horse industry and the
significant economic and jobs impact of this industry on Kentucky and
beyond.
As I said on the floor, "While we gather with friends and family to
watch the 140th running of the Kentucky Derby, let's not forget to
honor all of the men and women who make this great sport possible. From
the farm to the sales to the track and beyond, horses require the love
and care of each dedicated professionals at each step along the way and
without their efforts, the efforts of the owners, the breeders, the
trainers, the farriers, the grooms, the jockeys, the track operators,
the employees and all of the people who support the horse industry,
without their efforts, our great horse industry, our great pastime
simply would not be possible."

Supporting the Mission of the Blue Grass Army Depot
On Wednesday, I was glad to support passage of H.R. 4486, the FY2015
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, and
especially pleased that it included my request to fully fund the
Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA) program for the
completion of construction for the Blue Grass Chemical Agent
Destruction Pilot Plant (BGCAPP) at Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond,
Kentucky. The bill passed the House by a vote of 416-1.
Promoting Better Healthcare Reform Solutions
As I pointed out to the Herald-Leader last week, while they repeat the
political attack that I have no solutions to improve health care and
want to "take away health coverage.by repealing the Affordable Care
Act," I've worked hard to respond to constituents' requests to put
doctors, patients and families back in charge of health care, not
Washington bureaucrats.
Kentucky families, workers and business owners want healthcare reform
that lowers costs, expands coverage and covers pre-existing conditions
without hurting quality or cutting jobs. That is why I introduced the
bipartisan Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act with Dr. Congressman Ami
Bera, a Democrat from California.
Our legislation would improve patient care, reduce defensive medicine
and help lower healthcare costs by discouraging frivolous lawsuits. We
do this without limiting anyone's access to justice in cases of medical
negligence, but we provide better liability protection to health care
providers who follow evidence-based guidelines developed by the medical
community.
I have also cosponsored the American Health Care Reform Act, a
comprehensive alternative to Obamacare that would implement the common
sense, patient-centered reforms I've always supported, including
allowing individuals and families to deduct health care costs from
their income taxes; allowing small businesses and the self-employed to
pool together and get the same insurance rates as large corporations;
expanding health savings accounts; and safeguarding individuals with
pre-existing conditions by expanding state-based high risk pools and
coverage guarantees.
The Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act and the American Health Care Reform
Act are better solutions than Obamacare, which until replaced, will
continue to destroy jobs, hurt medical innovation, take away choices
and drive up costs.

Kentuckians in the Capitol
I enjoyed meeting with members of the Kentucky Fire Service where we
discussed issues important to both full-time and volunteer fire
fighters across Kentucky. I am proud to support our fire service
members and I will continue to work hard to help champion legislation
such as H.R. 3979, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency
Responders Act. I will also continue to advocate to fully fund the
Department of Homeland Security FIRE Grants that provide local fire
departments with much need fire equipment and staffing.
It was great to meet Steve Yates, the Chair of the University of
Kentucky Chemistry Department, and hear about his chemistry and nuclear
physics research. We also discussed how the federal government and the
National Laboratories can support the United States' economic and
scientific competitiveness.
I enjoyed speaking with Kentucky Optometric Association (KOA) President
Dr. Matt Burchett from Richmond, KOA Executive Director Darlene Eakin,
and other representatives from Kentucky about the importance of health
competition and patient choice.
I enjoyed meeting George Woolwine from Lexington, who was in town with
the American Council of Engineering Companies for their Annual
Convention and Legislative Summit.
On Wednesday, I had the honor of meeting Martha Casher of Lexington,
Jon Nipple of Georgetown, and Ron Willhite of Louisville while they
were in Washington to accept a national award recognizing the Kentucky
School Board Association's School Energy Managers Project, which has
produced some $34 million in energy cost savings for Kentucky's 173
public school districts since 2010.
I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the important issues facing
Kentucky's community banks with members of the Bluegrass Bankers
Association. We had a great discussion about the state of community
banking in Kentucky, how Washington rules limit their ability to lend
and provide services to their customers, and the prospects for passage
of my legislation, H.R. 2672, the HELP Rural Communities Act.
It was great to see members of the Kentucky Beverage Association and
hear more about the challenges their industry is facing and how we can
advance solutions to get Washington out of the way of job creation.
It was a pleasure to visit with Blaine K. Ayers, Executive Director of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (Kentucky, '01), Brandon Loschiavo, Senior at the
University of Kentucky, and Elizabeth Delaney, Senior at the University
of Louisville, to discuss incentives for charitable donations to
benefit non-profit collegiate housing.
I enjoyed meeting Chris Stewart of Lexington while he was in Washington
for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association to talk about the
successes of the Medicare Part D Program and ways that we can continue
to help provide seniors with affordable and convenient options to fill
their prescriptions.
I enjoyed meeting with National Education Association Director Eddie
Campbell of Knox County and Lisa Petrey-Kirk of Anderson County and to
discuss education issues such as standardized testing and the Common
Core curriculum in Kentucky. It is always a pleasure to meet with
Kentucky educators to discuss how to achieve better outcomes for our
students.
On Thursday, I had a great conversation with the Yurt family from
Lexington about solutions to the Washington policies threatening access
to medical equipment and services like specialized wheelchairs.
I was glad to sit down with Dr. Andrew Ryan from Lexington and Margie
Albano of the Kentucky Orthopaedic Society to discuss the sustainable
growth rate in Medicare reimbursement and commonsense reforms that will
improve patient care.
Around the District
It was great to see so many supporters of aviation at the Madison
County Airport Open House last Saturday, including Dr. Willie Walker,
Jason Bonham, Tonita Goodwin, Judge Clark and members of the Kentucky
Aviation Association. I shared an update on my office's work in
successfully expediting the fly-in of the FAA for inspection of the
runway lights on the extension, as well as our work helping to bring
the expansion opportunities needed for surrounding businesses and the
EKU Aviation Program.
It was a pleasure celebrating the dedication of the Sharpsburg
Community Center on Sunday. Thank you Mayor Clemons for your hard work
and commitment to this project.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find

Thank you and have a great week!

Last

about

As

that
I

I've

to
respond
to
constituents'

to
put
doctors,
patients
and

back
in

of
health

Kentucky

owners
want
healthcare
reform
that
lowers

without

That
is
why
I

I
enjoyed

with
members
of
the
Kentucky
Fire
Service
where
we
discussed
issues
important
to
both
full-time

across
Kentucky.
I
am
proud
to
support
our

members
and
I
will
continue
to
work
hard
to
help

such
as
H.R.

the

and

I
will
also
continue
to

the
Department
of
Homeland

that
provide
local

with

and
hear
about
his

We
also
discussed
how
the

and
the

the
United
States&#8217;
economic
and
scientific
competitiveness.
I
enjoyed
speaking
with

Optometric
Association
(KOA)
President
Dr.
Matt
Burchett
from
Richmond,
KOA
Executive
Director
Darlene
Eakin,
and
other

the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
important
issues
facing
Kentucky&#8217;s
community
banks
with
members
of
the
Bluegrass
Bankers
Association.
We
had
a

how
Washington
rules
limit
their
ability
to

ways

of
Anderson

and
to
