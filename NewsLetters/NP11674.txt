Over the
last several months, I have heard from many of you with concerns about
impending rate hikes, which disproportionally impact middle class
families and senior citizens in Florida, through the National Flood
Insurance Program. Preventing these rate increases in the short-term, and
finding ways to make flood insurance more affordable in the long-term,
have been top priorities for mine.
Last week, I cast my
vote in support of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of
2013.
This legislation passed the House of Representatives with
wide bipartisan support and a total count of 309-91.
This legislation is an important first step toward giving
Florida homeowners some relief from a massive, unaffordable hike in their
flood insurance premiums. Passing this legislation is critical to
maintaining growth in Floridas housing market and its entire economy. I
hope the Senate will follow our lead and pass this agreement
quickly.
The bill, H.R. 3370, addresses dramatic increases in flood
insurance premiums set under the reauthorization of the National
Flood Insurance Program in 2012.
The measure would restore
grandfathered rates for properties found in high-risk areas after remapping and
block increases mandated under the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance
Reform Act.
It would also remove the sales trigger, ensuring that
new homebuyers dont get caught off-guard with large, unexpected
premiums.
In addition, flood insurance premium increases would be
capped at 18% for most policyholders, and FEMA would be required to
issue guidelines on alternative methods of flood risk mitigation that must
be taken into account when calculating rates.
Overall, this
compromise addresses affordability concerns, mandates the implementation
of an affordability study, and increases FEMAs
accountability.
While this is a good first step, it does not solve the
problem.
Like you, I want a long term solution to make flood insurance
more affordable for middle class families and small businesses in
Florida and across the country.
I am committed to working towards
that goal and will continue to fight to make sure NFIP regains solvency,
while also ensuring reasonable rates for
policyholders.
I appreciate your
feedback.
