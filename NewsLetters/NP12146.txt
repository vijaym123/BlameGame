Contact Rep. Fattah
Dear
Friend,
On Sunday, the latest edition of " A Capitol Idea with Chaka Fattah ," my new public
affairs television program aired in
Pennsylvania.
This
recent
episode
features my interview with Charles Pierson,
President and CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters
of America. I also sat down for a conversation with Boys &amp; Girls
Clubs of Americas Youth of the Year, Kiana Knolland, to talk about her
experience as a Boys &amp; Girls Club member and the impact mentoring
has had on her life.
In Congress, I've continued to
fight to close the mentoring gap in our country and to increase funding
for mentoring programs nationwide. I hope this show will offer a
window into the power that a mentoring relationship can have on youth and
adults alike. I invite you to click below and
watch.
Thanks for watching,
Chaka
Fattah
