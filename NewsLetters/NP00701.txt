Capt. Adrian Evangelista (far right) of Tinian is among the U.S. Marines delivering aid to the thousands of victims of the April 25 earthquake in Nepal. Capt. Evangelista, a VMM-252 pilot, is pictured here as he helps load relief supplies at Biratnagar Airport. Between my flights to and from the villages in the Himalayas, I find the people welcoming and kind. I can see resilience in their faces, he says. To the Nepalese community in the CNMI, stay strongwe are here for you. Thank you, Captain Evangelista and all the men and women from the Northern Mariana Islands serving our country in uniform. Stay safe.
House passes Defense bill with NMI provisions, military pay increase
The National Defense Authorization Act for 2016
passed the House today, 269-151, with several provisions important to the Northern Mariana Islands:
*
More slots at military academies. The bill, H.R. 1735,
adds one more slot for students from the Northern Mariana Islands at the U.S. Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Military Academy at West Point. I doubled the number from 3 to 6 in U.S. Public Law 111-84,
but today only one of those 6 positions is unfilled. So, it is time again to increase the opportunities for our young people who want to serve their country.
*
Annual report on Japan military spending in the Marianas. The Secretary of Defense would be required to submit a report every year from 2017 through 2026, detailing the amount of funds contributed by the Government of Japan for the realignment of Marine Corps Forces in the Asia-Pacific Region. The annual report would cover total amounts contributed, anticipated contributions, and completed and planned projects in the Mariana Islands paid for with the Japanese money.
*
Respect for the views of local government. Responding to state government, a provision in last years House-passed Defense bill required that Governors are fully consulted and all options considered, when the military acquires land in excess of $750,000 in U.S. states and commonwealths. The Senate rejected the idea, but this year the House Armed Services Committee added the language again. Existing law, 10 U.S.C. 2664(a), requiring Congressional approval is unchanged: No military department may acquire real property not owned by the United States unless the acquisition is expressly authorized by law.
The 2016 NDAA also authorizes a 2.3 percent pay increase for military personnel, provides funding for suicide prevention programs, and strengthens provisions related to sexual assault in the military.

Champions again!
Mr. John Raulerson and his seven member Aeronautical Dolphins of Marianas High School stopped by their congressional district office to update me on their recent win in the Pacific Area Real World Design Competition (RWDC). Their project, called the Skywalker, is a remotely guided aircraft that could spread pesticides over sweet potato crops in the Northern Marianas. The team is now preparing for the National RWDC to be held in Washington, DC in November.
Good luck to the team and Go Dolphins!
Right decision to extend CJMT EIS comment period
Marine Corps Brigadier General David J. Furness notified me Wednesday of the decision to give the public an additional 60 days to respond to the U.S. militarys proposed expansion of activity on Tinian and Pagan. The decision to extend was the right thing to do. But the new deadline of August 4 ChST may not really be enough time given the scope of the proposed action and the complexity of the impacts on the Northern Mariana Islands. The CNMI Joint Military Training Draft Environmental Impact Statement is a 1,388 page document with 19 appendices that represents years of work by the military. The public and public officials deserve more than just a few weeks to digest all that information and respond in a meaningful way. The Inos administration was recently provided with a grant of $250,000 to contract for technical expertise to review and evaluate the draft EIS. The funds came from an FY15 technical assistance appropriation by Congress administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior. But Interior did not award the funds until a few days before the comment period began, leaving little time for the Commonwealth to advertise and contract for the technical services or for the contractors to review and prepare a response to the EIS. The military has authority to extend the comment period further. There is no maximum amount of time set by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

NEPA gives public a voice to stand up to build up
Republicans had their knives out for the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) at a Natural Resources Committee hearing this week. NEPA is often criticized for adding red tape and regulation. I made a statement defending the Act, which has given hundreds of ordinary people in the Northern Mariana Islands the power to voice their concerns about the proposed build-up of military activity on Tinian and expansion of training to Pagan. NEPA also forces big government agencies, like the Department of Defense, to thoroughly examine the environmental effects of any major action, including the social and economic impact on local communities and on public resources, such as wildlife and water. The Obama administration wants environmental impact assessments to recognize that global warming has to be factored in, as well. Many on the other side of the aisle claim they do not have the ability to understand the science of climate change. Those of us on islandsvulnerable to sea-level rise, changes in typhoon intensity and frequency, and loss of our protective coral reefsare much more sensitive to these realities. Read my statement here.

Ms. Erlinda Naputi, Acting Director of the Joeten-Kiyu Public Library, along with the Library Council, the hardworking staff, and library volunteers happily accepted 60 boxes of books containing over 1,500 titles that the congressional staff handpicked from surplus stocks at the Library of Congress. With summer vacation almost here the Library expects many more readers coming in looking for books. Thanks to the dedicated library staff and volunteers for your service to our community.
Federal student loan interest rates to drop next school year
The current interest rate of 4.66 percent on federal student loans will drop for the 2015-2016 school year to 4.29 percent, it was announced this week. The decrease is due to the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013
which ties rates based on the 10-year Treasury Note. Northern Marianas College students do not take out loans to help pay for tuition, but many of our college students studying outside the NMI find it necessary. The interest rate drop is good news for next years borrowers who will be able to take advantage of historically low rates, but it still leaves current borrowers locked into higher rates. Everyone working to repay their existing student loans should have access to the lower interest rates, which is why I am an original cosponsor to the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act. Introduced by Congressman Joe Courtney (D-Connecticut), H.R. 1434
would allow those with high interest undergraduate student loans in both the public and private markets to refinance their loans at more affordable rates.

Ms. Arlene Yamagata, Director of the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, and her ManAmko Take Over Day counterpart Ms. Benita Cepeda, along with OVR Administration and Operations Manager Ms. Josephine Tudela, visited their congressional district office this week. We discussed OVRs programs and the work they are doing to prepare individuals with disability for the workplace. Continued funding from Congress, see next story, will go a long way to making OVRs good work possible. Thank you all for the update.
$20,491 grant for Independent Living Programs
The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services has announced a grant of $20,491 for independent living programs in the Northern Mariana Islands. The goal of this grant is to support the improvement of services for individuals with significant disabilities and promote their full integration and inclusion into the mainstream of society. Congress appropriated the funds in Public Law 113-235. pdfs FY16/Appropriations_Language_NIH_2015.pdf">

The Tasi-Watch Program will train recent high school graduates, who are unemployed, to become community conservation rangers. Summer Eco-Camps will support a high school curriculum focused on conserving Saipans watersheds. The Managaha Pride Campaign will use social marketing and community outreach to educate citizens about the importance of Saipans Marine Protected Area network. Congress appropriated the funds in Public Law 113-235. pdfs FY16/Appropriations_Language_NIH_2015.pdf> Congratulations MINA!

$366,407 for solar power at Garapan Public Market
The Northern Mariana Islands Farmers Cooperative Association is the recipient of a federal grant to install a rooftop solar power system at the Garapan Public Market. The $366,407 solar system is expected to supply about half the Markets power needs, drastically cutting utility costs. Design and construction of the Garapan Public Market was paid for with a $200,000 earmark I added to Public Law 111-117
in 2009. Funding for the solar power system was appropriated in Public Law 113-235. pdfs FY16/Appropriations_Language_NIH_2015.pdf> Congratulations to the NMI Farmers Cooperative Association!

We say a sad farewell this week to Ms. Chai Cruz, who has been with the congressional office since the very beginning as my Executive Assistant and Office Manager. Ms. Cruz brought a great depth of experience with her, having previously worked for the Delegate from Guam, General Ben Blaz, and for two of the Northern Mariana Islands Resident Representatives, Juan N. Babauta and Pedro A. Tenorio. It is difficult to imagine how we could have been so successful over the years without her management skills, gracious manner in greeting constituents, and diligence in meeting all the complex administrative requirements of the U.S. House of Representatives. More than that Chai has been a pleasure to work with, friendly, energetic, never flustered. All of us will miss her and wish her all the best in her future life.
