Bill Stops EPA's Use of Secret Science
The EPA is on a regulation rampage.
Two new rules issued by the agency
represent the largest expansion of power by the federal government in
our nation's history.
The EPA's new water rule
would allow the federal government to regulate virtually any
water source in the U.S., including those in our own backyards.
And
the recent power plant rule
imposes strict carbon regulations on existing power plants that will
force many plants to shut down, costing thousands of jobs and driving
up electricity prices.
But the EPA's power grab isn't the only problem.
The agency continues
to base these costly regulations on secret science. For nearly three
years, the Science Committee has been trying to obtain data that the
EPA uses to justify its billion dollar regulatory agenda.
Shortly
after I became Chairman of the Science Committee, I issued a subpoena
for the data.
This was the Committee's first subpoena in 21 years.
Unfortunately, the EPA continues to stonewall our request.
If the EPA's
data really backs up their regulatory claims, then why not make the
information public?
Until the EPA makes this information public, they should not be allowed
to use secret science.
That's why, the Science Committee passed a bill
that will prohibit the EPA from basing regulations on secret science.
The Secret Science Reform Act
(H.R. 4012) requires that EPA data be made available for
validation and replication.
It shines a light on the EPA's secret
regulatory process by restoring transparency and accountability.
The American people foot the bill for the EPA's billion dollar
regulations.
They have a right to determine for themselves whether
these regulations are being driven by sound science or partisan
politics.
Health Care Costs on the Rise under Obamacare
When it comes to Obamacare, the President's broken promises continue to
pile up. The President promised that if you like your plan you can keep
it.
But for millions of Americans, that turned out not to be true.
He
promised that if you liked your doctor, you could keep them.
That's
not true either.
And the President said that Obamacare would help make health insurance
more affordable.
But across the country, millions of Americans are
seeing their premiums go up, not down.
In fact, according to a report
by Forbes
,
health care premiums are on the rise all across Texas due to the new
law.
Young Texans will see a hike in their health care premiums by
nearly 80% for a 27-year-old man and nearly 30% for a 27-year-old
woman. Middle-aged men will see a 54% increase, while 64-year-old women
will see an 18% rise in health care costs. In the 21st District of
Texas, some residents will see their premiums more than double!
It's no surprise that the more people find out about Obamacare, the
less they like it. A recent Rasmussen poll
found
that 54% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Obamacare.
Like so
many of this President's policies, Obamacare is actually making matters
worse. We should repeal Obamacare and replace it with policies that
have proved effective at reducing health care costs for all Americans,
not just a select few.

House Passes Smith Bill to Increase Accountability within Intelligence
Community
The House of Representatives recently passed legislation that I
sponsored to increase accountability within our intelligence community
and better protects civil liberties. The NSA Internal Watchdog Act
(H.R. 4533) enhances the role of the NSA
Inspector General and guarantees that there is an independent
investigator overseeing the actions of the intelligence community.
Our intelligence community has a responsibility not only to protect our
national security, but also to respect our civil liberties. Following
the terrorist attacks of September 11, Congress gave the intelligence
community additional authority to help detect and deter terrorist
threats facing our nation. Over a decade later, we are still engaged in
a global fight with radical Islamic terrorist organizations. To keep
America safe, we must use every tool available to us.
But that does not mean that our civil liberties should be ignored in
the name of national security. By increasing accountability, this bill
helps safeguard American lives and liberties.

Bill
Stops
EPA&#8217;s
Use
of
Secret
Science
The
EPA
is
on
a
regulation
rampage.
Two
new
rules
issued
by
the
agency
represent
the
largest
expansion
of
power
by
the
federal
government
in
our
nation&#8217;s
history.
The
EPA&#8217;s

would
allow
the
federal
government
to
regulate
virtually
any
water
source

the
U.S.,

And
the
recent
power

on
existing

that
will

But
the

power
grab
isn&#8217;t
the
only

The
agency
continues
to
base
these
costly
regulations
on
secret

For
nearly
three

the
Science

has
been
trying

its
billion

Shortly
after
I
became

I
issued
a

This
was
the
Committee&#8217;s
first
subpoena
in
21

Unfortunately,
the

our
request.
If
the
EPA&#8217;s

really
backs
up
their
regulatory

then
why
not

Until
the

they

the

Health
Care
Costs
on
the
Rise
under
Obamacare
When
it
comes
to
Obamacare,
the
President&#8217;s
broken
promises
continue
to
pile
up.
The
President
promised
that
if
you
like
your
plan
you
can
keep
it.
But
for
millions
of
Americans,
that
turned
out
not
to
be
true.
He
promised
that
if
you
liked
your
doctor,
you
could
keep
them.
That&#8217;s
not
true
either.
And
the
President
said
that
Obamacare
would
help
make
health
insurance
more
affordable.
But
across
the
country,
millions
of
Americans
are
seeing
their
premiums
go
up,
not
down.
In
fact,
according
to
a
report
by
Forbes ,
health
care
premiums
are
on
the
rise
all
across
Texas
due
to
the
new
law.
Young
Texans
will
see
a
hike
in
their
health
care
premiums
by
nearly
80%
for
a
27-year-old
man
and
nearly
30%
for
a
27-year-old
woman.
Middle-aged
men
will
see
a
54%
increase,
while
64-year-old
women
will
see
an
18%
rise
in
health
care
costs.
In
the
21 st
District
of
Texas,
some
residents
will
see
their
premiums
more
than
double!
It&#8217;s
no
surprise
that
the
more
people find
out
about
Obamacare,
the
less
they
like
it.
A
recent
Rasmussen
poll
found
that
54%
of
Americans
have
an
unfavorable
view
of
Obamacare.
Like
so
many
of
this
President&#8217;s
policies,
Obamacare
is
actually
making
matters
worse.
We
should
repeal
Obamacare
and
replace
it
with
policies
that
have
proved
effective
at
reducing
health
care
costs
for
all
Americans,
not
just
a
select
few.
