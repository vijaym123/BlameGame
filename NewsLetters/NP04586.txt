David -- really quick, I want to hear from you.
Right now, our team's putting together our issue agenda heading into my second term.
But first, we need your input!
So I'm asking for a quick favor: will you fill out our one-question survey and tell us what issue is at the top of your list? Click the links below to let us know what matters most to you:
Grow the middle class &gt;&gt;
Stand up for our veterans &gt;&gt;
Fight for equal pay &gt;&gt;
Create American jobs &gt;&gt;
Protect Medicare/Social Security &gt;&gt;
Something else? Let us know &gt;&gt;
Our campaign in 2014 was powered by the people. That's why I want to hear from you -- so that I can continue to best serve my constituents in 2015 and beyond.
Thanks for weighing in,
Cheri
