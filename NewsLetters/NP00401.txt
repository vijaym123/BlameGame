Dear Friend,
This week we scored a major victory for the rule of law when a federal judge upheld a lower court&#146;s order to stop implementation of President Obama&#146;s executive amnesty.
This is the latest development in a court case filed by 26 states to halt President Obama&#146;s actions which would prevent illegal immigrants from being deported.
The Obama administration has shown a clear disregard for the rule of law, the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution, and the rights guaranteed to American citizens. The president said 22 times that executive action on immigration was outside the scope of his authority, and even said, &#147;We&#146;ve got a government designed by the Founders so that there&#146;d be checks and balances.&#148; Article I of the Constitution clearly states that Congress has legislative powers, not the president, and I am not standing idly by while this president attempts to shred the Constitution. In addition to fighting the immigration action in the House of Representatives with legislation, including the Executive Amnesty Prevention Act, I also signed on to a brief to challenge the president&#146;s action on immigration in court.
The courts handed the American taxpayers a win when they kept President Obama from implementing his overreaching action on immigration, but this is just one of many instances where the administration has gone too far. From selectively deciding which portions of Obamacare to enforce, to attempting to regulate personal property with the Waters of the United States rule, to considering limiting access to hunting ammunition, our constitutional battles are far from over. There is still a lot of work to do during President Obama&#146;s final 20 months in office to hold this president and his administration accountable to the American people. I&#146;m on the front lines working tooth and nail to make sure that happens.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
On Memorial Day we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation. You may be gone, but you and your family are not forgotten.
It&#146;s been over a year andThe United States Department of Justicestill has not charged Lois Lerner with abusing her position at the IRS to target conservative groups. This week I joined my colleagues in calling on Loretta Lynch to finally hold Lerner accountable.

The administration is telling us that the Waters of the United States rule won&#39;t affect property owners and farmers, and that&#146;s an absolute lie. The Obama administration has misled the American people too many times to get the benefit of the doubt on something this important.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
