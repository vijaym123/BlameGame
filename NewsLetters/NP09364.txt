Honoring Our Veterans
Monday, May 26, 2014
Dear Friend,
Memorial Day is an annual occasion for us to remember and pay tribute to those who fought and died for our country. However, like you, I strongly believe that we must also honor and support our servicemembers and veterans the remaining 364 days of the year. That&rsquo;s why throughout my time in Congress I have focused on ensuring that our servicemembers, veterans, and their families receive the assistance, benefits, and treatment they deserve.
Knowing how critical it is for local veterans and their families to have access to quality health care services, I am proud that veterans in our district do not have to travel more than 15 miles for care. Among the first things I did in Congress was to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to open community-based outpatient clinics in Lynn, Gloucester, and Haverhill. Since then, I have successfully worked with the VA to expand the Lynn clinic and am now working to expand the Gloucester clinic to accommodate the needs of local veterans, particularly women veterans and those who are interested in accessing mental health services.
One of my most important responsibilities as your Congressman is to help veterans and their families obtain the benefits that have been earned but not received. I was grateful to have been able to recently award a Wilmington resident with 6 long-overdue medals for his bravery and service in the Navy during World War II and to thank him for his valor and selfless dedication to our country.
His story is truly an inspiration.
In closing, I join with all Americans today to honor our veterans for their brave and selfless service to our country. Their sacrifice and commitment to keeping our country safe will never be forgotten.
Sincerely,
John F. Tierney
Member of Congress
