Congressman Kingston Urges Vote in Congress on Military Action Against ISIS
Washington
- Following President Obama's speech to the country last week outlining his strategy for combating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Congressman Jack Kingston (R-GA) has urged the Congress to take up the matter in a standalone vote. Article I of the Constitution provides that only Congress has the power "to declare war," and this Congress should do its duty to the American people.
Since Thursday, Congressman Kingston has appeared on various national media outlets expressing his desire for a debate and vote in the Congress.
Huckabee:
"We sho uld have a formal authorization of the use of force"
Smerconish:
"I don't know why you run for Congress though if you're afraid to cast a vote... Democrat or Republican"
All In w/ Chris Hayes:
"I do believe there are Members [of Congress] in both parties who would rather avoid a vote"
As the Congress returns to work today, Congressman Kingston will keep arguing for a debate before the American people and a vote on this important decision.
