Opposing Dangerous Executive
Action by the President
Last week, the
Wall Street
Journal
reported
that President Obama plans to
bypass Congress by transfering and releasing Guantanamo Bay detainees
through executive order. With the rising threat of ISIS and a renewed
need for continued military action in Iraq and Syria-- locales that
many current Guantanamo detainees hail from--how could the White House
possibly think that now is the time to start releasing them? The Taliban
5, released by the White House in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl, were
transferred to Qatar--which we now know harbors many individuals who are
funding ISIS. This shows an appalling lack of judgment and foresight
from the President. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to make
their opposition to any executive action to close Gitmo well
known.
Presenting a Grant Check to the
Franklin School of Innovation
The Franklin School of Innovation in
Asheville received a $195,285 grant from the U.S. Department of
Education. Serving Buncombe County students, the Franklin School of Innovation
is a free public charter school. As a strong supporter of education
alternatives, I was pleased to learn about the unique way Principal
Michelle Vruwink and her colleagues are equipping our students for the
future.
Celebrating the Eastern Band of
Cherokee Indians
Debbie and I had the pleasure of joining the Eastern Band
of Cherokee Indians for their annual parade--despite the rain!
Following the parade, the annual Cherokee Indian Fair kicked off, which is a
century-old celebration of the Cherokee Indian
culture.
Pisgah High School ROTC Annual Inspections
Ceremony
It was a pleasure to attend the Pisgah High School Navy Junior
ROTC Annual Inspections Ceremony. I had the honor of watching the
ceremony with Paul Willis, a WWII Veteran, Commander Michael Weaver, and
North Carolina State Senator Jim Davis. I'm grateful to Paul Willis and
Commander Weaver for their service to our
nation.

Celebrating Hendersonville Farm City
Day
Last weekend, I had a great time at
the annual Hendersonville Farm City Day.
This annual tradition
was established in 1955 to highlight the inter-dependency between
farmers and city folks. I'm grateful to our Western NC farmers for all they
contribute to the community.
