Rep. Bob Goodlatte
The War on Affordable Energy
With the days getting
shorter and the air crisper, families and businesses in the Sixth District are likely starting to use a little more electricity. As folks start to see
electric bills tick up during the winter months, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the cost of electricity getting much higher &ndash; but consider this.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average
residential electricity rate in the United States is 12.39 cents per kilowatt-hour. In Virginia, it is slightly lower at 10.91 cents per
kilowatt-hour. In comparison, German households pay roughly 37 cents per-kilowatt-hour, largely due to their use of more expensive and less reliable
energy sources.
Can you imagine how much your electric bill would be
each month if you were paying rates that high? That&rsquo;s exactly what we do not want see, and cannot afford to see, in the United States. For many
it&rsquo;s difficult enough to make ends meet as it is, but what will happen if the Obama Administration&rsquo;s proposed regulations on power plants
are enacted?
In June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put forth
a plan to require fossil fuel fired power plants, including those using coal to generate electricity, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent
by 2030. The result would essentially be cap-and-trade by another name and result in the shuttering of power plants throughout the nation that provide
a large amount of America&rsquo;s electricity.
The EPA&rsquo;s proposed
plan will harm job creation and raise prices to consumers as industries cut back due to higher costs. Additionally, it would cause many of the energy
providers that we rely upon each day to have no other choice but to raise prices and force more of Americans&rsquo; hard-earned income to go towards
paying the electric bill. What has often been characterized as the Obama Administration&rsquo;s war against coal is really a war against affordable
energy, and in turn, the working poor, retirees living on fixed incomes, rural communities, and inner city families &ndash; all people hit
particularly hard by higher energy costs.
Rather than this onslaught of
costly regulations, let&rsquo;s focus on policies that won&rsquo;t raise the cost of living for American consumers or hinder the ability of American
businesses to compete. The House of Representatives has passed legislation that would stop the EPA&rsquo;s proposed power plant regulations and
instead encourage the development of all our resources in order to make energy more affordable for American families. Now it&rsquo;s time for the
Senate to act. Read my full column

Bill to Protect Sexual Assault Survivors Signed into Law
This week, the
Debbie
Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014
(H.R. 4323) was signed into law. This bipartisan bill, which I introduced in the House, protects sexual assault
victims and helps remove criminals from our streets. It reauthorizes a federal grant program for state and local governments to reduce the backlog of
rape kits through 2019. Each of these DNA test kits represents a life that has been shattered by the horrors of rape. Sadly, we can&rsquo;t take away
the pain and fear these women have experienced, but we can provide necessary resources used to solve these crimes so that they don&rsquo;t have to
live in fear waiting for their perpetrators to be found and brought to justice. You can read more

U.S. Secret Service Director
Resigns
After several security failures that have undermined Americans&rsquo; confidence
in the Secret Service&rsquo;s ability to protect the President, it&rsquo;s clear that the agency needs a change in leadership. On Wednesday, Director
Julia Pierson
resigned
from her post. We need a thorough
review of the agency to identify systemic problems and implement solutions to prevent such security lapses from happening again in the future. With
that in mind, the House Judiciary Committee will hold both public and classified hearings on the agency in November.
