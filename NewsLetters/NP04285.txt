Thanksgiving 2014: Remembering Those Not At the
Table
As we gather with family and friends this week, let us give
thanks for those who are not at the table for the holidays! The men
and women of our armed forces, all volunteers, are serving abroad,
separated from their loved ones at Thanksgiving!
We must never
forget that we are a nation at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
We
still have thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen on the Korean
Peninsula, in the Sinai and across the Baltics and Germany.
Yes,
the list of challenges facing America appears daunting as our country
seems to be lurching from crisis to crisis at every turn.
But
despite all that we face, we still have the best military, a powerful
and growing economy and a fundamental strength and character that will
serve us well for years to come.
Frankly, if the attitude
of the troops I meet is any indication, America has a bright
future.
Those are giving men and women who are willing to serve the cause
of freedom.
They, and their families, deserve our thanks each
and every day.
Happy Thanksgiving!
