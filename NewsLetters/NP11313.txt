The Imperial
Presidency
President Obama has made it
clear that he will regularly sidestep both Congress and the law and
take action unilaterally.
This is contrary to our founding
fathers system of checks and balances.
The President should
not disregard laws that are inconvenient for him, or rewrite them via
executive order to suit his own preferences.
This playbook of
imperial rule is evident in numerous examples, from the record pace of
federal regulations issued by the executive branch to the multitude of
changes the president has made to the healthcare law without
congressional authorization.
These concerns are not just a partisan
invention.
Jonathan Turley, a liberal law professor from George
Washington University and political supporter of the President,
criticized him in a Los Angeles Times op-ed recently titled
The President's Powergrab .
The Constitution is
clear: Congress writes the laws, and the President is to faithfully
uphold the laws that are in place, whether signed by the current President
or a predecessor.
No short-term political agenda is worth
allowing the erosion of the constitutional roles of the President,
Congress, and the Judiciary.
This approach to government is
unacceptable, and for that reason I joined my colleagues in the House of
Representatives to pass the
Faithful Execution of the Law Act
(H.R. 3973) and the
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and
Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law,
or the ENFORCE the Law
Act
(H.R. 4138) last week.
These bills send a strong
message to the president that duly passed laws by the United States
Congressrepresentatives of the peopleshall be faithfully
executed.

Sincerely,
Sam Graves
