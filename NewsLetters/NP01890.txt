Friend,
We&rsquo;ll be quick-- we have less than 36 hours until our first major deadline
and we need our grassroots team behind us.
We have $4,154 left to raise and very little time left. Missing our goal is not an option and even donations of $5 or $10 make a HUGE difference, especially since they will be matched dollar-for-dollar by our two longtime supporters.
Can we count on you?
Click here to give $5 before our deadline of midnight tomorrow.
Your contribution will be matched dollar-for-dollar.
Our campaign relies on folks like you&mdash;people digging deep and chipping in a few dollars at a time.
Our opponents may rely on a few folks to write million dollar checks into their Super PACs, but our team is stronger because we have thousands of supporters who are willing to invest in our efforts.
We know it&rsquo;s early, but this first deadline matters.
Only a little over $4,000 to go.
Will you chip in here?
Thanks,
Team Bera
P.S. Remember, with our dollar-for-dollar match, if you give today, your $10 will become $20 or your $50 will become $100.
This is a great opportunity to double the impact of your contribution.
Please click here to give $5, $25, or whatever you can right now.
