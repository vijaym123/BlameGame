Dear Friends,
First,
I would like to say thank you. One of the highest honors of my life is
representing the First District of Mississippi. I am grateful for the
continued opportunity to represent you in
Washington.

The House of Representatives reconvened on
Wednesday for legislative business and to begin preparing for the 114th
Congress. As I walked into a Wednesday afternoon meeting, I was
greeted with a surprise from my colleagues. Keep in mind, this particular
meeting is led by my friend
Majority Whip Steve
Scalise
( LA-01 ), a LSU fan. Knowing that my alma
mater is Mississippi State and appreciating the momentum of the
football team, the Mississippi State fight song was playing when I
arrived.
It has been
an
exciting season for Mississippi football , and I am grateful to my
colleagues for the thoughtful surprise.

Keystone XL
Pipeline
The majority of Americans support
building the Keystone XL pipeline and because of this,
for
the 9th time I voted
to approve
building this important projec t .
The House passed
H.R. 5682, to approve the
Keystone XL Pipeline
by
a vote of
252-161 .
The Keystone XL pipeline would create over
42,000 jobs and reduce our dependence on oil from hostile regions of
the world. After six years and multiple environmental tests indicating
that the pipeline would have minimal environmental impact, it is time
for Senate Democrats and the Obama Administration to stop standing in
the way.
