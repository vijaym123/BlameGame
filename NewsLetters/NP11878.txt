Dear
David,
I hope this finds you well.
Here are
some updates on my work for New
Mexico:
WIPP
Many of you have asked questions or voiced concerns
about WIPP.
I welcome these calls, and we are working to make sure
New Mexicans receive the answers they deserve, and to assist
concerned constituents in any way we can.
On
Thursday, I spoke with Energy Secretary Moniz about WIPP.
Specifically,
we discussed the new information about employee exposure to
radiation, the safety and health of the general public, and the concern I share
with the surrounding communities that the Department had not been
providing sufficient information.
The call was very productive and
I feel he appreciated the comments I shared from the community.
He committed to improving the flow of information and
confirmed
the importance of keeping the trust on solid ground.
I
thanked him and let him know that I will continue to keep in contact with
him and will continue to ensure that the community gets timely and
accurate information.
Updates can also be found at
www.wipp.energy.gov .
For Carlsbad area
residents that have questions about public health related to the WIPP
incident, the Carlsbad Environmental Monitoring &amp; Research
Center is offering its services: you may contact them at (575)
887-2759, or

Government Accountability
This week,
I voted for H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the
IRS Act of 2014.
The bill adjusts IRS standards for making
determinations on 501(c)(4) organizations, in order to better protect
Americans from political discrimination.
Americans were rightly
outraged to learn that the IRS abused its authority to bully and
discriminate.
Still, we have seen no significant action taken by this
administration to address this problemWashington is plagued by a
disturbing lack of transparency and accountability.
H.R.
3865 takes a step in the right direction, protecting taxpayers from being
targeted by the IRS for their political beliefs.
Protections like
these form the cornerstone of a healthy and free
democracy.
This was part of a series of bills passed by the House this
week aimed at stopping government abuse and restoring accountability
and transparency.
On Tuesday, I voted for H.R. 2531, the
Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act, which similarly aims to
protect Americans from unfair treatment by their
government.
Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau
Also this week, I voted for, and the House passed H.R. 3193, the
Consumer Financial Protection and Soundness Improvement Act of
2013.
Since its inception, the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB) has operated with zero accountability.
Their
decisions favor Wall Street and Beltway politics at the expense of states
like New Mexico.
This bill attempts to change that.
It
attempts to bring accountability by replacing the CFPBs powerful director
with a five-member commission.
It subjects the CFPB to an
appropriations process so it must answer to the taxpayer for how money is
spent.
It limits regulatory overreach that costs jobs and hurts New
Mexicans.
And, it prohibits the CFPB from using personal
financial information without the consumers consent.
To learn
more about the CFPB and its impact on New Mexico, watch my recent
conversation of CFPB Director Richard Cordray can be seen
here .
Have you heard "Congressional
Review" this week?
Every weekend, I'm on the radio across New
Mexico discussing important legislation, events in New Mexico, and my
work in Congress.
Be sure to tune in!
If you haven't heard
the show, call your local radio station to ask when Congressional Review
is on the air in your hometown! ?xml:namespace prefix = o

Remember, I always look forward to
hearing your thoughts on how to help job growth, veterans, and other
issues important to New Mexicans.
If you have any ideas,
suggestions, or concerns, you can contact my office through
