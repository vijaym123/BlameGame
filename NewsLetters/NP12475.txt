News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Unless you spend a lot of time on federal lands or you are directly
impacted by water rights in California, this week's legislative
activity probably isn't going to be all that interesting to you.
So in
lieu of rehashing all of the technical amendments and details of the
most recent floor activity, I wanted to try to use this week's letter
to explain the stir caused by the latest economic projections related
to the President's healthcare law.
Earlier this week, many of you probably saw a flurry of headlines
regarding a new report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
citing "2.5 million jobs lost as a result of the Affordable Care Act"
or something to that effect.
The Democrats promptly responded by
saying that the report doesn't indicate that people are going to lose
jobs.
It's actually a lot more complicated than that and I wanted to
try to explain what the report actually says.
So here' goes.
To start with, the quote in question (below) is from page 117 of CBO's
new report under the heading,
"Labor Market Effects of the Affordable
Care Act:
Updated Estimates":
"CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours
worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period
from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to
supply less labor-given the new taxes and other incentives they will
face and the financial benefits some will receive."
Some news outlets and commentators took that to mean that 2.5 million
people will lose their jobs as a result of the healthcare law.
That's
not what CBO is saying.
CBO is saying that people will choose to work
less hours. a lot less hours.
So many hours, in fact, that it is the
equivalent of two and a half million full-time jobs.
In a nutshell, because of the certain mix of tax increases and
subsidies, many workers will decide it is in their financial interest
to work less.
Say what.?
This actually happens a lot in government programs where well-meaning
provisions end up creating a perverse incentive for people.
In layman's
terms (which I prefer), the government's perverse incentive structure
is paying some people not to go to work at all or to select a job with
fewer hours and less benefits.
Or conversely, the government's
incentives create a situation where it behooves a CEO in certain
situations to cut his or her employee's hours or perhaps stop offering
health coverage all together.
So how and why does this happen?
There is a simple truth about
government policy (at any level).
tax something and you will get less
of it.
Subsidize something and you will get more of it.
In this country, we tax work, we tax savings, and we tax investment.
In short, we tax all of the things that we want people to do more of.
We even have disincentives in the tax code for getting married (more on
that in a second).
On the opposite side of the ledger, our policies tend to subsidize
(whether we explicitly intend to or not) staying home, working less,
spending more, borrowing more and so on.
All of the things we want
less of.
It's easy to understand how it got that way, but that doesn't
make it right.
Below is the introduction from an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal
written by a man back in 2012 who explicitly supported the law.

ObamaCare's Costs to the Working Class: Perverse incentives will make
part-time work more attractive than a better-paying full-time job
By David Gamage
WSJ - October 30, 2012
"It is time to move past the debate over whether ObamaCare was a good
or a bad idea. I count myself as an ObamaCare supporter, but this
doesn't blind me to the law's flaws. Regardless of who wins the [2012]
presidential election, bipartisan compromise will be necessary to
reform health care in a constructive way.
"The most important provisions of ObamaCare are scheduled to take
effect in 2014. I have been researching ObamaCare and assisting with
its implementation, and have come to this realization: Without further
reforms, the law will create unnecessary costs for working-class
Americans.
"Consider a low-income American supporting a family of four deciding
whether to take a part-time job that pays $36,000 a year or a full-time
job that pays $42,000 a year. According to my research, accepting the
higher-paying job could result in the family losing over $10,000 a year
in health-care subsidies.
"Moreover, by switching low-income employees to part-time positions,
rather than offering them health insurance, an employer will be able to
save over $3,000 a year by avoiding ObamaCare's employer-mandate
penalties. Without further reforms, many employers and employees will
jointly benefit if employers make low-income employees part-timers
rather than offering them health insurance. The losers will be
taxpayers, who will need to fund the subsidies that these employees
will be eligible for."
Mr. Gamage goes on to explain the so-called "marriage penalty":
"Consider a couple with children in which one of the parents earns most
of the family's income. If the couple marries, the family would lose
thousands of dollars of subsidies that could otherwise be used to pay
for health insurance for the children and the lower-income spouse. If
the couple is already married, divorce may be their only option for
obtaining affordable insurance for their children and the lower-income
parent."
Obviously, the goal of healthcare reform wasn't to encourage happy
couples to get a divorce, but that's the effect of the incentives in
the law...
This happens with basic income tax calculations as well.
In many cases, you are financially better off just not getting married.
All of this is to say that regardless of what our intentions as
policymakers may be, we owe it to the people we represent to pay
careful attention to the unintended consequences.
Those consequences
are an inevitable byproduct whenever the federal government comes in
and tries to "fix everything".
It's like a game of whack-a-mole. You
hammer down one problem over here and you create another one over
there.
Then you need more big, sweeping policy measures to deal with
that problem.
And in doing so, you create two more.
It's the nature
of the beast.
In any case, that's all from me for now.
If there is anything you all
need or you think I should be aware of, please let me know.

Rich Nugent

Dear

<![endif]
Unless
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
federal
lands
or
you
are
directly
impacted
by
water
rights
in
California,
this
week&#8217;s
legislative
activity
probably
isn&#8217;t
going
to
be
all
that
interesting
to
you.
So
in
lieu
of
rehashing
all
of
the
technical
amendments
and
details
of
the
most
recent
floor
activity,
I
wanted
to
try
to
use
this
week&#8217;s
letter
to
explain
the
stir
caused
by
the
latest
economic
projections
related
to
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law.
Earlier
this
week,
many
of
you
probably
saw
a
flurry
of
headlines
regarding
a
new
report
from
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
citing
&#8220;2.5
million
jobs
lost
as
a
result
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8221;
or
something
to
that
effect.
The
Democrats
promptly
responded
by
saying
that
the
report
doesn&#8217;t
indicate
that
people
are
going
to
lose
jobs.
It&#8217;s
actually
a
lot
more
complicated
than
that
and
I
wanted
to
try
to
explain
what
the
report
actually
says.
So
here&#8217;
goes&#8230;
To
start
with,
the
quote
in
question
(below)
is
from
page
117
of
CBO&#8217;s
new
report
under
the
heading,
&#8220;Labor
Market
Effects
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act:
Updated
Estimates&#8221;:
&#8220; CBO
estimates
that
the
ACA
will
reduce
the
total
number
of
hours
worked,
on
net,
by
about
1.5
percent
to
2.0
percent
during
the
period
from
2017
to
2024,
almost
entirely
because
workers
will
choose
to
supply
less
labor&#8212;given
the
new
taxes
and
other
incentives
they
will
face
and
the
financial
benefits
some
will
receive. &#8221;
Some
news
outlets
and
commentators
took
that
to
mean
that
2.5
million
people
will
lose
their
jobs
as
a
result
of
the
healthcare
law.
That&#8217;s
not
what
CBO
is
saying.
CBO
is
saying
that
people
will
choose
to
work
less
hours&#8230;
a
lot
less
hours.
So
many
hours,
in
fact,
that
it
is
the
equivalent
of
two
and
a
half
million
full-time
jobs.
In
a
nutshell,
because
of
the
certain
mix
of
tax
increases
and
subsidies,
many
workers
will
decide
it
is
in
their
financial
interest
to
work
less .
Say
what&#8230;?
This
actually
happens
a
lot
in
government
programs
where
well-meaning
provisions
end
up
creating
a
perverse
incentive
for
people&#8230;
In
layman&#8217;s
terms
(which
I
prefer),
the
government&#8217;s
perverse
incentive
structure
is
paying
some
people
not
to
go
to
work
at
all
or
to
select
a
job
with
fewer
hours
and
less
benefits.
Or
conversely,
the
government&#8217;s
incentives
create
a
situation
where
it
behooves
a
CEO
in
certain
situations
to
cut
his
or
her
employee&#8217;s
hours
or
perhaps
stop
offering
health
coverage
all
together.
So
how
and
why
does
this
happen?
There
is
a
simple
truth
about
government
policy
(at
any
level)&#8230;
tax
something
and
you
will
get
less
of
it.
Subsidize
something
and
you
will
get
more
of
it.
In
this
country,
we
tax
work,
we
tax
savings,
and
we
tax
investment.
In
short,
we
tax
all
of
the
things
that
we
want
people
to
do
more
of.
We
even
have
disincentives
in
the
tax
code
for
getting
married
(more
on
that
in
a
second).
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
ledger,
our
policies
tend
to
subsidize
(whether
we
explicitly
intend
to
or
not)
staying
home,
working
less,
spending
more,
borrowing
more
and
so
on.
All
of
the
things
we
want
less
of.
It&#8217;s
easy
to
understand
how
it
got
that
way,
but
that
doesn&#8217;t
make
it
right.

ObamaCare's
Costs
to
the
Working
Class:
Perverse
incentives
will
make
part-time
work
more
attractive
than
a
better-paying
full-time
job
By

&#8220;It
is
time
to
move
past
the
debate
over
whether
ObamaCare
was
a
good
or
a
bad
idea.
I
count
myself
as
an
ObamaCare
supporter,
but
this
doesn't
blind
me
to
the
law's
flaws.
Regardless
of
who
wins
the
[2012]
presidential
election,
bipartisan
compromise
will
be
necessary
to
reform
health
care
in
a
constructive
way.
&#8220;The
most
important
provisions
of
ObamaCare
are
scheduled
to
take
effect
in
2014.
I
have
been
researching
ObamaCare
and
assisting
with
its
implementation,
and
have
come
to
this
realization:
Without
further
reforms,
the
law
will
create
unnecessary
costs
for
working-class
Americans.
&#8220;Consider
a
low-income
American
supporting
a
family
of
four
deciding
whether
to
take
a
part-time
job
that
pays
$36,000
a
year
or
a
full-time
job
that
pays
$42,000
a
year.
According
to
my
research,
accepting
the
higher-paying
job
could
result
in
the
family
losing
over
$10,000
a
year
in
health-care
subsidies.
&#8220;Moreover,
by
switching
low-income
employees
to
part-time
positions,
rather
than
offering
them
health
insurance,
an
employer
will
be
able
to
save
over
$3,000
a
year
by
avoiding
ObamaCare's
employer-mandate
penalties.
Without
further
reforms,
many
employers
and
employees
will
jointly
benefit
if
employers
make
low-income
employees
part-timers
rather
than
offering
them
health
insurance.
The
losers
will
be
taxpayers,
who
will
need
to
fund
the
subsidies
that
these
employees
will
be
eligible
for.&#8221;
Mr.
Gamage
goes
on
to
explain
the
so-called
&#8220;marriage
penalty&#8221;:
&#8220;Consider
a
couple
with
children
in
which
one
of
the
parents
earns
most
of
the
family's
income.
If
the
couple
marries,
the
family
would
lose
thousands
of
dollars
of
subsidies
that
could
otherwise
be
used
to
pay
for
health
insurance
for
the
children
and
the
lower-income
spouse.
If
the
couple
is
already
married,
divorce
may
be
their
only
option
for
obtaining
affordable
insurance
for
their
children
and
the
lower-income
parent.&#8221;
Obviously,
the
goal
of
healthcare
reform
wasn&#8217;t
to
encourage
happy
couples
to
get
a
divorce,
but
that&#8217;s
the
effect
of
the
incentives
in
the
law...
This
happens
with
basic
income
tax
calculations
as
well.
In
many
cases,
you
are
financially
better
off
just
not
getting
married.
All
of
this
is
to
say
that
regardless
of
what
our
intentions
as
policymakers
may
be,
we
owe
it
to
the
people
we
represent
to
pay
careful
attention
to
the
unintended
consequences.
Those
consequences
are
an
inevitable
byproduct
whenever
the
federal
government
comes
in
and
tries
to
&#8220;fix
everything&#8221;.
It&#8217;s
like
a
game
of
whack-a-mole.
You
hammer
down
one
problem
over
here
and
you
create
another
one
over
there.
Then
you
need
more
big,
sweeping
policy
measures
to
deal
with
that
problem.
And
in
doing
so,
you
create
two
more.
It&#8217;s
the
nature
of
the
beast.
In
any
case,
that&#8217;s
all
from
me
for
now.
If
there
is
anything
you
all
need
or
you
think
I
should
be
aware
of,
please
let
me
know.
