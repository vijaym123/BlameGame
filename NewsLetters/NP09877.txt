Congressional Report -- Week of May 5-9: Happy Mother's Day -
Feliz Da de las Madres
Hello Friend,
This week was even busier than usual. I spent most of the time working
on or attended hearings of House Armed Services Committee in
Washington, D.C. This week, we "marked up" the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA). The committee markup is one of the last steps
before a bill can be considered by the entire House.
Late Friday, I headed home to Texas to spend a week traveling and
visiting with folks throughout the district. This morning, I am honored
to be speaking at the commencement of my alma mater - Sul Ross State
University in my hometown of Alpine, Texas. Go Lobos!
Field Representatives were also busy during the week. They visited
Eagle Pass, Del Rio, Fort Stockton, Big Lake, and MCamey, and made a
lot of visits throughout San Antonio.

Happy Mother's Day - Feliz Da de las Madres
National Defense Authorization Act Markup
Older Americans Month
Thanks to First Responders
Happy Mother's Day - Feliz Da de las Madres
This weekend we celebrate Mother's Day or Dia de las Madres.
To the two women in my life - my wife Mara Elena and my mother Elena -
feliz Da de las Madres and Happy Mother's Day. Mara Elena has been
beside me for over 24 years - and through many challenging times. She
also gave me the most incredible and precious gift ever - the gift of a
child. Becoming a parent changed my whole life. Nicols has become the
center of our universe.
My mom, affectionately known as "Mrs. G" - short for Mrs. Gallego -
gave me life, saw me grow up and shaped me into the person I have
become. She taught me that patience and persistence are always a
winning combination. Against all odds, my mom to me to fight on anyway.
To every mom on their special day: Happy Mother's Day and Feliz Da de
las Madres! Thank you for all you do for us - your sons and daughters.
We owe you more than we can ever say. Muchas gracias! To read my full
statement on Mother's Day, click here

National Defense Authorization Act Markup
I already talked some about the markup, but there's more. It lasted
about fourteen hours - starting on the morning of May 7 and going into
the early hours of May 8 - in the historic House Armed Services
Committee room. We went through a seemingly endless stream of
amendments. The National Defense Authorization Act sets policies for
the Department of Defense and the national security programs in the
Department of Energy.
Throughout the year, I worked hard with my Texas colleagues on the
Armed Services Committee - both Democrats and Republicans - to make
sure that our sons and daughters in uniform have the tools and
resources need to be successful and as safe as possible.
I've been fighting hard against sequestration. Irresponsible, partisan
gridlock in Congress means that sequestration is continuing, which in
turn hurts our national defense and those who serve us. Our Soldiers,
Sailors, Airmen, and Marines at home and abroad deserve so much better.
Members of Congress must put patriotism ahead of partisanship - and
demonstrate the same commitment to public service that our warfighters
show every single day. Rest assured I'll continue to fight for them.
Saying goodbye to spring interns. From left to right: Christopher
Maxwell, Greg Talamantez IV, Amala Chacko and Joseph Cortina. Best of
luck to all! Thanks for your hard work for 23rd District of Texas.
Older Americans Month
May is Older Americans Month, and believe it or not, we'll all get
there. As we get old, our lower extremities will hurt more often, and
we'll have to visit or physicians more. But getting old is part of
life. It's part of maturing.
During my time in Congress, I've made it a priority to protect and
safeguard Medicare, Social Security and veterans benefits, as well as
other programs that seniors rely on. I pledge my continued commitment
to these safety net programs so they can continue to exist for those
whose work has helped make our country what it is.
So the next time that you see an older person crossing the street or
needing help with their groceries; please make sure, to lend a helping
hand - because we know that some day we will need help, too. To read

Thanks to First Responders
Since late April, first responders and emergency crews have fought a
large grass fire in northwest Val Verde County. A big THANK YOU to
first responders, firefighters, volunteer firefighters, Texas Forest
Service crews, Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers and
employees and to Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) staff for
their work in containing this fire.
Local fire crews came from around the region including volunteers from
Val Verde County, Sheffield, Comstock, Ozona, Big Lake, Iraan and
Sonora Volunteer Fire Departments. I can't thank them - and their
families - enough for their work and dedication to their neighbors and
our fellow Texans.
As of May 6, the fire was 80 percent contained and had burned about
14,437 acres.
The Texas Forest Service indicates that only two unoccupied mobile
homes/hunting cabins were lost due to fire, though several structures
were threatened. I'll continue to monitor the situation.
I always end by saying "thank you" for letting me be your congressman.
It is a responsibility I take seriously. If I can help you with a
federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices. The phone
numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big fan of
politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please put
our office to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

National
Defense
Authorization
Act
Markup
I
already
talked
some
about
the
markup,
but
there's
more.
It
lasted
about
fourteen
hours
&#8211;
starting
on
the
morning
of
May
7
and
going
into
the
early
hours
of
May
8
&#8211;
in
the
historic
House
Armed
Services
Committee
room.
We
went
through
a
seemingly
endless
stream
of
amendments.
The
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
sets
policies
for
the
Department
of
Defense
and
the
national
security
programs
in
the
Department
of
Energy.
Throughout
the
year,
I
worked
hard
with
my
Texas
colleagues
on
the
Armed
Services
Committee
&#8211;
both
Democrats
and
Republicans
&#8211;
to
make
sure
that
our
sons
and
daughters
in
uniform
have
the
tools
and
resources
need
to
be
successful
and
as
safe
as
possible.
I've
been
fighting
hard
against
sequestration.
Irresponsible,
partisan
gridlock
in
Congress
means
that
sequestration
is
continuing,
which
in
turn
hurts
our
national
defense
and
those
who
serve
us.
Our
Soldiers,
Sailors,
Airmen,
and
Marines
at
home
and
abroad
deserve
so
much
better.
Members
of
Congress
must
put
patriotism
ahead
of
partisanship
&#8211;
and
demonstrate
the
same
commitment
to
public
service
that
our
warfighters
show
every
single
day.
Rest
assured
I&#8217;ll
continue
to
fight
for
them.
Saying
goodbye
to
spring
interns.
From

to
right:
Christopher
Maxwell,
Greg
Talamantez
IV,
Amala
Chacko
and
Joseph
Cortina.
Best
of
luck
to
all!
Thanks
for
your
hard
work
for
23rd
District
of
Texas.
Older
Americans
Month
May
is
Older
Americans
Month,
and
believe
it
or
not,
we&#8217;ll
all
get
there.
As
we
get
old,
our
lower
extremities
will
hurt
more
often,
and
we&#8217;ll
have
to
visit
or
physicians
more.
But
getting
old
is
part
of
life.
It&#8217;s
part
of
maturing.
During
my
time
in
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
made
it
a
priority
to
protect
and
safeguard
Medicare,
Social
Security
and
veterans
benefits,
as
well
as
other
programs
that
seniors
rely
on.
I
pledge
my
continued
commitment
to
these
safety
net
programs
so
they
can
continue

exist
for
those

our
country
what
it
is.
So
the
next
time
that
you
see
an
older
person
crossing
the
street
or
needing
help
with
their
groceries;
please
make
sure,
to
lend
a

&#8211;

we
know
that
some
day
we
will
need
help,
too.
