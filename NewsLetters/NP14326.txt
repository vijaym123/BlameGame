Rogers Votes For Kentuckians to "Keep Your Health Plan"
WASHINGTON, DC --
U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) applauds passage of the "Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013" (H.R. 3350), an effort that won bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives after hearing from hundreds of thousands of people who now face losing their healthcare plans due to ObamaCare. Nearly 300,000 Kentuckians alone have received notice of cancellation from their insurance providers. Rogers co-sponsored the bill to allow providers to continue to offer health insurance plans that individuals and families currently have through 2014.
"Today, thousands of Kentucky mailboxes are filled with insurance cancellation notices. It's time to relieve Americans from being forced to find new healthcare coverage options as a result of multiple broken promises from the Obama Administration," said Rogers. "Even after admitting you can't keep your health care plan as promised, the President has threatened to veto this bill to fix it. None-the-less this bipartisan effort speaks loudly for people across the country who want to keep the coverage they have trusted year after year. I strongly urge the Senate and the President to listen to the outcry from Americans and move quickly to pass this legislation."
Earlier this week, former President Bill Clinton said, "I personally believe even if it takes a change in the law, the President should honor the commitment to the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got."
In fact, Section 1251 of the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act (ACA) states that nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) shall be construed to require that an individual terminate coverage under a group health plan or health insurance in which such individual was enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act.
Congressman Rogers has repeatedly voted to repeal ObamaCare altogether.
