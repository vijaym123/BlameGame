 of a Japanese journalist and a Jordanian pilot by ISIS. Amid reports
of crucifixions taking place in ISIS-held territory and the organization's systematic torture, rape, and killing of children, it's clear that ISIS is a spreading cancer that must be eradicated. It cannot be reasoned with or moderated - the only course of action is to annihilate its leadership, destroy its support network, and discredit its ideology.
I recently discussed the spread of ISIS with Megyn Kelly on Fox News. You can watch the interview at the link here .

This week has been filled with grim news, including the savage
murders
of a Japanese journalist and a Jordanian pilot by ISIS. Amid
reports
of crucifixions taking place in ISIS-held territory and the organization&#8217;s systematic torture, rape, and killing of children, it&#8217;s clear that ISIS is a spreading cancer that must be eradicated. It cannot be reasoned with or moderated &#8211; the only
course of action is to annihilate its leadership, destroy its support network, and discredit its ideology.
I recently discussed the spread of ISIS with Megyn Kelly on Fox News. You can watch the interview at the link
