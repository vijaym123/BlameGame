Rubio Delivers Address On Values At
Catholic University
During a speech at Washington
D.C.s Catholic University on
Wednesday, Marco drew attention to one of
the largest
yet often least
discussed
contributors to our
nations economic troubles: the
breakdown of the American family and the
erosion of fundamental values that has
followed. An excerpt of the speech is
below:
Rubio: A strong America is
not possible without strong Americans
a people formed by the values
necessary for success, the values of
education and hard work, strong
marriages and empowered parents. These
are values that made us the greatest
nation ever, and these are the values
that will lead us to a future even
better than our past.

ICYMI: Rubio Delivers Senate Floor
Speech On The Conflict In Gaza
In
a
Senate floor speech
on Thursday,
Marco addressed growing criticism of
Israels response to Hamas, a
terrorist organization that is conducting
indiscriminate attacks against
Israel.
In response to
a
letter he received
from Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) Ambassador
to the U.S., Maen Rashid Areikat, Marco
criticized the Palestinian
Authoritys continued willingness
to govern with a terrorist organization
and urged the Palestinian government to
condemn Hamas.
On Thursday, Marco joined U.S.
Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Charles
E. Schumer (D-NY), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH)
and Ben Cardin (D-MD)
to
announce a new Senate resolution
urging the Obama administration to ensure
that any ceasefire does not leave Israel
vulnerable to attacks from rockets or via
tunnels.
An excerpt of the speech is below:
Rubio: I hopethe United
States continues tobe firmly on
the side of Israel,because there
is no moralequivalency
here.What is happening between
Israeland Hamas is totally 100
percent thefault of
Hamas.There is no moral
equivalencyhere.All of the
blame lies on Hamas.And for this
crisis to end,Hamas must either
be eliminatedas an organization,
or they mustlay down their
weapons andadhere to the true
precepts ofpeace. Which is the
desire to livepeacefully with
their neighborIsrael.

Rubio, Colleagues Seek Congressional
Review Of Any Final Iran Nuclear
Agreement
With a four-month extension of Iran
nuclear talks announced by the Obama
administration last week, Marco joined
Senators Bob Corker (R-TN), Lindsey
Graham (R-SC), John McCain (R-AZ) and
James Risch (R-ID) to introduce
legislation requiring congressional
review of any final agreement with
Iran.The bill also would prevent
further extensions of the negotiations,
strictly enforce Irans compliance,
and prevent implementation of a final
agreement if a veto-proof majority of
Congress disapproves of the deal
An excerpt of Marcos exchange
is below:
Any final agreement of a
matterof this consequence should
bereviewed by this body,
shouldcome before Congress, and
shouldhave the ability of
Congress toprovide oversight over
it.And the absence of that, I
believe,unfortunately, leaves
usvulnerable
not just to
aterrible deal
but to a
dangerousone that could
potentiallyendanger the future of
ourallies and even of our
owncountry.
...
So the Iranians in this
wholenegotiation view themselves
asbeing in a position of
strength.To be quite frank, they
believethat our president wants
thisdeal more than they
do.They believe he wants this
dealmore than they do.And
that's what puts themin this
tremendous position
ofstrength.And the result
is that thesenegotiations are not
going to,in my view
I
hope that I'mwrong, I hope that
tomorrow weopen up and read, you
know what?They've changed their
mind.They don't want to do any
moreterrorism, no rockets and
nonuclear weapon program
andthey've become just a
normalgovernment and a normal
country.
Don't hold your hopes out
forthat because that is not
whatthey've shown in the past,
thatis not what they're doing
now,and they are negotiating from
aposition of strength
becausethey believe that the
presidentwants a deal much more
than theywant or need a
deal.

ICYMI: Rubio: Save A Tampa Cigar
Institution
Throughout the week, Marco worked to
keep Tampas family-owned J.C.
Newman Cigar Company from going out of
business as the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) considers new,
constricting regulations. Below is an
excerpt from his op-ed in the
Tampa Bay Times :
Newman is not being
threatened by economic recession. It's
not in danger of closing its doors for
being too slow to adapt in a changing
industry, nor is it being out-innovated
by its competitors. Newman employees'
jobs aren't at risk because of 21st
century automation or cheaper overseas
labor. On the contrary, the human touch
involved in its cigarmaking is part of
the charm and craftsmanship that sets
them apart.
No, what now threatens Newman
is that a federal government agency,
the Food and Drug Administration,
decided to write regulations targeting
the premium cigar industry that are so
constricting that they have the
practical effect of singling out Newman
by proposing to regulate high-quality,
hand-rolled cigars in the same manner
as the makers of low-quality,
machine-made cigars. This means more
needless FDA testing, paperwork and
fees.

Agency Updates
Social Security Launches New
Expedited Disability Process for
Veterans
The Social Security
Administration announced the launch of a
new disability process to expedite
disability claims filed by veterans with
a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
disability compensation rating of 100%
Permanent &amp; Total (P&amp;T). Under
the new process, Social Security will
treat these veterans applications
as high priority and issue expedited
decisions, similar to the way the agency
currently handles disability claims from
Wounded Warriors.
In order to receive
the expedited service, veterans must tell
Social Security they have a VA disability
compensation rating of 100% P&amp;T and
show proof of their disability rating
with their VA Notification Letter.
The VA rating only
expedites Social Security disability
claims processing and does not guarantee
an approval for Social Security
disability benefits. These veterans must
still meet the strict eligibility
requirements for a disability
allowance.

this service, please visit:
