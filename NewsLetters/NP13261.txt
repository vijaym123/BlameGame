Dear
Friend,
Happy New Year!
It has been an honor to represent you in
the United States Congress and a pleasure to meet so many of you
face-to- face this year.
As you know, 2013 was full of
challenges.
There are those in Congress who wish to turn the clock
backwards.
Together we will not let that happen.
Your input has been
instrumental in guiding my efforts on your behalf.
Last year I
asked you to send me your priorities.
I took your responses
and created a roadmap that guided me to worked hard on the issues near
and dear to you.
Based upon your responses to our surveys'
throughout the year,
the following is a list of your
priorities:
Creating jobs and expanding
economic
opportunity
Enacting meaningful legislation on gun violence
prevention
Protecting
Social Security, Medicare &amp;
Medicaid
Promote higher education
Improving
our health care system
Addressing
global warming and protecting the environment
Passing
comprehensive immigration
reform
Advancing our nation's energy
independence
Advancing equality for LGBT Americans
Advancing criminal
justice
Reducing our national debt and
deficit
Helping small
businesses
As we begin a new
session of Congress in 2014, I want you to take a moment and let me know
what matters to you in the upcoming year.
What has changed?
What issues continue to be a problem?
And what issues do you
think need more attention?
Thank you for giving me the
opportunity to work with you this year.
I look forward to 2014 and
together we can make a difference.
Happy
Holidays!
