Combating ISIL in Iraq and Syria
>From Intelligence and Armed Services briefings and evidence on the
ground, I have come to believe the risks of inaction against the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) are greater than the risks
of taking action against this threat. The President has outlined a
strategy with which I largely agree, but I believe the military effort
underway requires authorization from Congress. As representatives of
the people, it is our Constitutional duty to debate this issue, and an
additional authorization, provided that it is carefully tailored and
limited in scope, could help strengthen the current coalition effort.

As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I heard testimony
from top administration officials about the President's plan to combat
ISIL. You can watch my remarks from the hearing here

Scenes from Maine
Meeting with residents at Durgin Pines, a long-term care facility in
Kittery. I spent a day touring several facilities
in southern Maine that provide
long-term care and support services to our seniors. Maine is one of the
oldest states in the country, and communities like Durgin Pines provide
our aging population with first-class services.
They sure know how to name their horses at Pineland Farms
in New Gloucester. I had a great visit to Pineland's
creamery, greenhouse, market, and equestrian center, a tour that
highlighted the importance of both local food and public access to
recreational opportunities.
Scenes from Washington
Earlier in the month, Senator Susan Collins and I attended the Taste of
Maine Reception
hosted by the
Maine State Chamber of Commerce. The event was held in the Senate's
Kennedy Caucus Room, and featured a variety of Maine-made products.
What a great opportunity to share Maine's best with Washington.
Peter Miesburger from the Maine Veterans of Foreign Wars is an
authority on the issues facing our veterans, which is why it's always
important for me to check in with him. I'm glad that Peter was able to
make the trip down from Caribou earlier this month to discuss the VFW's
legislative priorities and ongoing reform at the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
Photos from my Instagram Account
I've joined the photo-sharing world of Instagram so that you all can
see pictures I take on my IPhone. Hopefully it gives you a snap-shot
into my work, both in Washington and Maine. Here are a few examples -
I'd be pleased if you follow me @senangusking.
The west exit of the great Capitol rotunda. The door where the flag
hangs is where the president starts down the steps to the podium where
the inauguration occurs. What a place to get to work!
An amazing group of Maine leaders at the Envision Maine Summit. You'll
notice they're all smiling - probably because they hadn't heard my
speech yet!
