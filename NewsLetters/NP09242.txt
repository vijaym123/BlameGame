Dear Friend,
Thank you for following my email reports during my first term as a
Member of Congress.
It has been an honor to represent the people of
South Florida, and I look forward to having the opportunity to continue
serving this district. If you wish to receive regular updates for the
second part of 2014 as the 113thCongress begins to wrap up business, I
encourage you to subscribe to my email reports by clicking on the sign
up button.
Over the next several months, I'll be sending out reports covering many
topics that concern, or directly impact, the people of Palm Beach and
Broward Counties. More Americans need jobs, especially in South
Florida, and we need to come together to help them find work. This is
especially true for our returning veterans. We must also ensure the
long-term solvency of our Social Security system, and the well being of
our seniors, and our generations of seniors of tomorrow.
It's time that our economy work for everyone, not just the big
corporations. Women should be paid an equal wage as men for performing
comparable work. When women succeed, America succeeds.
For these reasons, and so many more, there is much Congress must
accomplish before the end of the current session.
Sign up to get the
most up-to-date information from my office.
I look forward to hearing from you should you have any issues you want
to discuss.
If you need help with anything, my district office in Boca
Raton can assist you as best to their ability.
Thank you for your
support and keep an eye out for more updates!
Always,
Lois Frankel
