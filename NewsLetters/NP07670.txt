Friend -
Recently, the House passed
H.R. 657 , which I cosponsored, expressing support for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks from the Hamas terrorist organization, and calling on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket fire and other attacks on Israel.
I stand with Israel.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Additionally, I supported the United StatesIsrael Strategic Partnership Act,
H.R. 938 , affirming the Houses support for Israels security and the shared values between the United States and Israel.
