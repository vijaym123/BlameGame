Dear
Friends,
On Thursday, I attended a classified briefing for members
of Congress where intelligence officials outlined the dangers that
the Islamic State group known as ISIL or ISIS poses to American
interests.
As a nation, we must act decisively and deliberately to
protect America and the world from the threat of
terrorism.
ISIL presents a clear threat to peace worldwide and has committed
heinous acts against innocent Americans, Syrians and Iraqis. We must work
with a coalition of international partners to ensure that ISIL is
dismantled and can no longer spread its malicious culture of hate and
torture.
America must be united as a nation and with our
allies in defense of freedom and liberty, and the president last night
presented a plan to counter and neutralize ISIL.
In that vein,
I believe that Congress owes it to the American people to have a
thoughtful, reasoned debate on this issue and bring it to the floor for a
vote.
PUSHING FOR HEALTH CARE
REFORMS
This week, the House took another step to allow families
to keep their doctors and insurance plans by passing H.R. 3522, the
Employee Health Care Protection Act.
This bill would allow
group health insurance plans offered in 2013 that were deemed not
compliant with the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to be offered now and for
the next five years. These plans would be considered to meet
Obamacares minimal essential coverage, and small business and their employees
would be able to purchase these plans regardless of whether they were
enrolled in them in 2013.
Simply put, the Employee Health
Care Protection Act keeps the presidents promise that people who like
their health insurance can keep it, and it also provides more
affordable alternatives for small businesses whose health care costs are
soaring.
And while the House continues to address the inherent
flaws in Obamacare, I will continue to fight for meaningful,
patient-centered health care reforms.
I spoke on the House floor
Wednesday about the Employee Health Care Protection Act and the need for
enact real reforms.

WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
I
voted yes Tuesday on legislation to prohibit the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency from broadening its authority over state and local
waters.
H.R. 5078, the Waters of the United States Regulatory
Overreach Protection Act, passed the U.S. House of Representatives
262-152. The bill would prohibit the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers
from enacting a proposed rule regarding the waters of the United
States and expanding the EPAs jurisdiction into state and local
waters.
By redefining waters of the United States under the Clean
Water Act, the EPA and the Army Corps would be able to claim jurisdiction
over nearly any area connected to downstream navigable waters,
including ditches.
This proposed rule has nothing to do with
keeping waters safe for consumption or preserving our waterways
its
about the EPA once again expanding its authority over state and local
jurisdictions.
Under the vague regulation proposed by the EPA
and the Corps of Engineers, federal power would grow, subjecting our
farmers, construction workers and energy producers to even more
regulations, red tape and delays.
Im proud to support legislation
to reject this proposed rule and send federal officials back to the
drawing board to work with state and local leaders on a jurisdictional
waters rule that makes sense for our economy and our
environment.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the
conversation on
Facebook
and

Sincerely,
