More Questions Than Answers: Ebola and
ISIS
Ebola and the brutal terrorist group ISIS once again dominated the
talk around my Congressional District and I continue to be very
concerned about how the Administration confronts these issues.
What
is our strategy in Iraq and Syria?
The
Washington Post
ran this revealing
editorial
Mr. Obamas half-hearted fight against ISIS earlier this
week.
On Ebola, I wonder why the Administrations medical
experts cannot come up with a coherent plan to further protect the American
people from exposure to infected travelers entering our country from
the African hot zone or from our southern border, for that matter.
The CDC is
urging
healthcare workers
back from West Africa, with the highest risk for carrying Ebola, to
isolate themselves voluntarily, while our military is
requiring
21-day quarantines for our troops returning from
Liberia, even though they are not supposed to be in contact with
Ebola!
Focus on a Growing Economy and New
Jobs
With October coming to a close, members of the House
and Senate will return to Washington in a few weeks.
Hopefully,
the Senate will decide its finally time to act as the House passes
jobs bills in the coming lame duck session of Congress!
In
the last year and a half, the House has passed more than 40 bills
aimed at boosting the economy, creating jobs and easing the financial
pain that is affecting working families all over New
Jersey.
Where are these bills now?
They all are
stuck in the Senate where Majority Leader Harry Reid wont even bring
them up for debate!
Now, these bills are not thousands of
pages long, nor are they partisan attempts to foist massive new
programs on the American people.
No, these are common-sense jobs
bills, many of them bipartisan, aimed at strengthening small
businesses, allowing working families to keep more of their wages, and helping
our seniors and veterans.
Even though the President and the
Senate have not been willing to work with the House, we will continue
to develop and pass meaningful legislation when we reconvene the
Appropriations Committee in November.
Obamacare
Premiums Skyrocket for Families,
Individuals
Remember the assertion by the President that Obamacare would
lower
health insurance premiums for the typical
family and it would happen by 2013?
Well, its 2014
and we now know the truth.
As a
Forbes
article cites, new health research shows that non-group
premiums (those policies families and individuals have to buy on their own
instead of getting one from their employer) in 44 states have increased
by an average of 24.4 percent versus what was expected prior to
enactment of Obamacare.

And now a brand new problem for people obtaining
health insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges: they can't find
a doctor who will take them as patients.
Get the details from
the Tuesday
edition
of
USA
Today .
From The Now Ive
Heard it All Department
The millions of health
insurance cancellations caused by Obamacare do not mean people are losing
insurance, according to a top Health and Human Services official
they just mean people are being invited to join an Obamacare
exchange.
From HHS Regional Director Joanne
Grossi:
So, I just want to remind you that you werent losing insurance, you
were just losing that insurance plan and were now being invited to go
into the health insurance
marketplace.
Frightening Progress for the North Koreans: Who is Sounding the
Alarm?
The
New York Times
recently published a disturbing story about North Koreas capability to
marry a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile.
