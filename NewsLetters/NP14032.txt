Friend,
This week, as we take time to be grateful for those in our lives, I wanted to send a quick note of thanks your way.
Thank you for being a part of our team, whether that means staying updated on our race, reading our emails, or volunteering your time, talents, and resources.
Without you, this wouldn&#39;t be possible, and I am humbled by the thousands of people standing with our team every day.
I&#39;m looking forward to spending this Thanksgiving holiday with my family, and I hope you have the opportunity to spend time with those important to you.
In grace and with gratitude, Happy Thanksgiving.
Be well,
