Friend -- President Obama emailed you yesterday.
I&rsquo;m emailing to follow up.
It&rsquo;s because Election Day begins in a mere 48 hours -- this is literally your final chance to help.
It&rsquo;s unbelievable, but the Senate is STILL anyone&rsquo;s game.
Twelve races are still polling neck and neck. When it&rsquo;s this close -- when a few hundred votes could decide control of the entire Senate --
we need to keep fighting until the very last hour.
We can contact tens of thousands of Democrats over the next 48 hours, but only if we can meet our budget by midnight tonight. It would be absolutely heartbreaking to lose this election at the last minute -- please don&rsquo;t let that happen.
Will you pitch in to help us get voters to the polls? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift and send it immediately to deadlocked battlegrounds!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Let&rsquo;s not forget how much is at stake here. We&rsquo;re fighting to protect our Democratic Senate majority. Send Tea Party extremists packing. Even defeat Mitch McConnell!
But if you don&rsquo;t step up, we could be dealing with two years -- or more -- of a McConnell-led, President-obstructing, shutdown-threatening Senate.
Please make the right choice. Pitch in right now, and we&rsquo;ll triple-match it and immediately send it out into the field, where it will make the most difference.
Thank you for standing strong with Democrats,
Senator Patty Murray
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
