Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
This week was the 50th annual National Small Business week-a week to
recognize and highlight the contributions of America's entrepreneurs
and small businesses. We can't overestimate the importance of small
businesses to our economy and to the strength of our communities.
The 3rd District is fortunate to have many diverse small businesses
that provide good-paying jobs to hard-working Coloradans.
I visited
with some of these entrepreneurs and business owners this week during
two small business roundtable discussions in Glenwood Springs and
Craig, and at a small business tour where I met with the fifth
generation owners of
F.M. Light and Sons, a western clothing store in
Steamboat Springs.
At F.M. Light, the owners, Lindsay and Chris, talked about what goes
into making a small business a success for 109 years. As you might
expect, a lot of hard work, innovation and creativity are at the core.
Their story is truly inspiring, and the history of this Steamboat
Springs institution is as impressive as the dedication of the employees
that work there today.
Since being elected to Congress I have met with small business owners
just like Lindsay and Chris all across our district in industries
including manufacturing, aerospace, farming and ranching, retail,
restaurants, and financial services. A common message from many of
these job-creators is that they would like to expand and hire more
workers. Unfortunately, they are all too often hampered by endless
regulations coming out of Washington that increase costs and create
uncertainty. This is something I too encountered during my 30 years of
owning and operating a small business.
The solution to providing greater opportunities for American small
businesses and creating the incentive and economic climate in which to
grow is clear-Washington needs to get out of the way and reduce
overregulation.
While we have had some success in the House in repealing or stopping
harmful regulations and cutting red tape, there is much work that needs
to be done to fix the system. To implement the regulatory reforms this
country needs, the Senate must join us in standing up for hardworking
Americans and vote on the House passed jobs bills that would restore
opportunity for small businesses and jumpstart economic growth.
Learn
more about some of the efforts we have passed in the House to reduce
red tape and get Americans back to work HERE
.
Americans want to work. Small businesses want to hire. By passing these
commonsense efforts into law, we can help provide the opportunities for
small businesses to succeed and create jobs.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It
Congressman Tipton with Lindsay and Chris at F.M. Light and Sons
Tipton raises concerns over new Forest Service water directive:
Congressman Scott Tipton stressed that the Forest Service's newly
proposed Directive on Groundwater Resource Management includes overly
broad language that will expand the agency's regulatory reach over
groundwater and jeopardize privately-held water rights. The directive
is strikingly similar in function and tone to a recent Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rule to redefine waters of the United
States to vastly expand that agency's regulatory scope over surface
water. Read more

Grand Junction Daily Sentinel: Tipton makes regulation a pocketbook
issue: Overregulation of the energy industry is "creating income
disparity in this country," U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton said Wednesday.
Speaking at the Energy & Environment Symposium, hosted by Garfield
County and Colorado Mesa University's Unconventional Energy Center,
Tipton said overreaching rules affect everyone from struggling young
couples to retirees on fixed incomes, both directly impacting their
energy costs and indirectly affecting prices of other items such as
groceries. Read more

Craig Daily Press: US Rep. Scott Tipton visits Steamboat, Craig to
discuss issues facing Northwest Colorado: U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton,
R-Colo., made his way through the Yampa Valley on Monday as part of his
Colorado tour to learn more about issues facing the state and to share
his congressional plans. Tipton stopped in Steamboat Springs on Monday
to discuss small business with F.M. Light & Sons and later hosted a
town hall meeting in Craig. At the Craig event, he focused primarily on
water rights, greater sage grouse issues, the Affordable Care Act and
the energy industry. He said that the federal government hands down too
many restrictions on public and private lands. Read more

federal water grabs, the latest of which was recently introduced by the
U.S. Forest Service.
This is the third recent attempt by the federal
government to control water in the west.

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
This
week
was
the
50th
annual
National
Small
Business
week&#8212;a
week
to
recognize
and
highlight
the
contributions
of
America&#8217;s
entrepreneurs
and
small
businesses.
We
can&#8217;t
overestimate
the
importance
of
small
businesses
to
our
economy
and
to
the
strength
of
our
communities.
The
3rd
District
is
fortunate
to
have
many
diverse
small
businesses
that
provide
good-paying
jobs
to
hard-working
Coloradans.
I
visited
with
some
of
these
entrepreneurs
and
business
owners
this
week
during
two
small
business
roundtable
discussions
in
Glenwood
Springs
and
Craig,
and
at
a
small
business
tour
where
I
met
with
the
fifth
generation
owners
of
F.M.
Light
and
Sons,
a
western
clothing
store
in
Steamboat
Springs.
At
F.M.
Light,
the
owners,
Lindsay
and
Chris,
talked
about
what
goes
into
making
a
small
business
a
success
for
109
years.
As
you
might
expect,
a
lot
of
hard
work,
innovation
and
creativity
are
at
the
core.
Their
story
is
truly
inspiring,
and
the
history
of
this
Steamboat
Springs
institution
is
as
impressive
as
the
dedication
of
the
employees
that
work
there
today.
Since
being
elected
to
Congress
I
have
met
with
small
business
owners
just
like
Lindsay
and
Chris
all
across
our
district
in
industries
including
manufacturing,
aerospace,
farming
and
ranching,
retail,
restaurants,
and
financial
services.
A
common
message
from
many
of
these
job-creators
is
that
they
would
like
to
expand
and
hire
more
workers.
Unfortunately,
they
are
all
too
often
hampered
by
endless
regulations
coming
out
of
Washington
that
increase
costs
and
create
uncertainty.
This
is
something
I
too
encountered
during
my
30
years
of
owning
and
operating
a
small
business.
The
solution
to
providing
greater
opportunities
for
American
small
businesses
and
creating
the
incentive
and
economic
climate
in
which
to
grow
is
clear&#8212;Washington
needs
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
reduce
overregulation.
While
we
have
had
some
success
in
the
House
in
repealing
or
stopping
harmful
regulations
and
cutting
red
tape,
there
is
much
work
that
needs
to
be
done
to
fix
the
system.
To
implement
the
regulatory
reforms
this
country
needs,
the
Senate
must
join
us
in
standing
up
for
hardworking
Americans
and
vote
on
the
House
passed
jobs
bills
that
would
restore
opportunity
for
small
businesses
and
jumpstart
economic
growth.
Learn
more
about
some
of
the
efforts
we
have
passed
in
the
House
to
reduce
red
tape
and
get
Americans
back
to
work
HERE .
Americans
want
to
work.
Small
businesses
want
to
hire.
By
passing
these
commonsense
efforts
into
law,
we
can
help
provide
the
opportunities
for
small
businesses
to
succeed
and
create
jobs.
Sincerely ,
In
