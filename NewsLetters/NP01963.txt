David, I really need to talk with you.
This morning, Nancy Pelosi asked you to support my campaign.
Since then, 466 of you have responded to her call-to-action! Thank you! But as of 9:30pm, we&rsquo;re still coming up 34 short ahead of our critical fundraising deadline.
David, in a race as close as ours, we can&rsquo;t afford to miss even a single goal -- especially not this early on. So I&rsquo;m asking:
Will you chip in $5 or more to our campaign by midnight?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

Thanks for your continued support,
Cheri
P.S. Sorry for all these emails. I know it can be a lot, but your support will help us start the election strong.
