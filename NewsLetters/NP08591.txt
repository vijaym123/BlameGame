Dear
Friend,
I have always
thought that fiscal responsibility starts at home. That's why every year
I work with my staff to find additional savings that we return to the
U.S. Treasury to be used for deficit
reduction.
This year I'm proud to announce that I am
returning $56,460.12 to the taxpayers.
I am always looking for
ways to save taxpayer dollars, starting right here in my congressional
office where I can manage how these dollars are spent. I have given
back a portion of my congressional budget every year since taking
office, for a grand total of
$1.5 million
returned.
Wisconsinites know the value of a dollar, and want to see the
tough decisions get made to put our budget back on track. We need to
overhaul our spending policies and pay down the debt so that our
children and grandchildren arent stuck with our unpaid bills. Wisconsin
families know how to manage their budgets and thats precisely the kind of
discipline we need in
Washington.
Sincerely,
