Dear Friend,
I am home nearly every week meeting with constituents so I can best represent the needs of the 53rd District.
Next Monday evening I will be home to host a town hall style event at Garfield Elementary School to hear how you think Congress should address the top issues facing our country.
Details are below.
I hope to see you there!
Warm regards,
Susan A. Davis
Member of Congress
