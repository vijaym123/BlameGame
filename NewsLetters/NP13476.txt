Dear
friend,
I hope you and your family are having a safe and happy holiday
season. I want to extend my best wishes for happiness and health to
everyone in the new year.
During the holiday season Im always
reminded of our courageous servicemen and women around the world,
especially those who are separated from their families during this time of
year. To each of our men and women in uniform
thank you for your
service and for keeping us safe.
I wish all of you and your
families a very happy holiday season and a wonderful new year. Its an
honor to represent New Hampshire in the United States Senate and Im
looking forward to the year ahead.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
