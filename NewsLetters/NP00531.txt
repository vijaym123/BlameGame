Dear Friend:
I&#39;ve called on Congress to pass a long&#45;term transportation funding plan so local projects &#45; as well as public safety&#44; jobs&#44; and economic growth &#45; are not at risk. Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve been working in Congress for you&#58;

Highlighting local transportation projects at risk of losing federal funding
The Highway Trust Fund was set to expire at the end of the month&#44; but the House of Representatives managed to pass a short&#44; two&#45;month extension. This imperfect solution means that 660&#44;000 construction jobs remain at risk&#44; and uncertainty continues for 6&#44;000 critical transportation projects across the country. That&#39;s why I was in Dobbs Ferry to call on Congress to pass a
long&#45;term reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund
&#44; on which local projects like the Ashford Avenue Bridge depend. Making improvements to the transportation networks that families and local businesses rely on every day should be common sense. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I vow to fight for critical investments in our nation&#39;s crumbling infrastructure.
I was joined by Eileen Hendricks from Westchester County Legislator MaryJane Shimsky&#39;s office&#44; Laborers Local 60 business manager Anthony Ascencao&#44; Operating Engineers Local 137 president Anthony J. Braccio Jr. and business manager Jeff Loughlin&#44; Construction Industry Council&#39;s George Drapeau&#44; as well as other members of Operating Engineers Local 137 and Laborers Local 60 in Dobbs Ferry to call on Congress to re&#45;authorize the Highway Trust Fund&#44; otherwise roughly &#36;5 million for the Ashford Avenue Bridge is at risk&#44; jeopardizing public safety&#44; jobs&#44; and economic growth.
Honoring service members and their families on Memorial Day
On Memorial Day&#44; we paused and paid
special recognition
to the men and women of the Armed Services who gave their lives in defense of this nation&#44; fighting for democracy and freedom. At ceremonies throughout Westchester and Rockland this past weekend&#44; I joined residents in Clarkstown&#44; Cortlandt&#44; Congers&#44; Orangetown&#44; Montebello&#44; New Castle&#44; Peekskill&#44; and Ossining to honor the acts of valor and heroic efforts of our service members protecting American ideals &#45; the highest form of public service. I will continue to ensure that service members and their families receive the support they need.
I joined constituents at Memorial Day events throughout Westchester and Rockland counties.
Supporting Rockland law enforcement
I attended the
Rockland County Law Enforcement Memorial Committee Annual Memorial Service
in New City to remember the men and women who have bravely served the Rockland community since 1905&#44; including those who died from 9/11 related illnesses. The rifle salute and bagpipes served as a reminder that we should honor the memory of those who lost their lives in the line of duty and do all we can to support our local law enforcement personnel. I spoke with Police Chief William Barbera from the Rockland County Sheriff&#39;s Office and Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe about my efforts as the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee to increase funding that benefits local law enforcement.
I spoke with Police Chief William Barbera of the Rockland County Sheriff&#39;s Office and Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe about providing local law enforcement with the federal resources they need.
Celebrating Head Start&#39;s 50th Anniversary
Last week marked the
50th Anniversary of Head Start
&#44; which provides high&#45;quality early education for children from birth to age five. Head Start and Early Head Start served almost one million children and their families nationwide last year&#44; including more than 3&#44;000 in Westchester and Rockland counties. By investing in the mental&#44; social&#44; and emotional development of young children&#44; Head Start gives a child the best opportunity to prepare for school and builds a foundation for a healthy and successful life. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I will continue fighting to increase Head Start funding because nothing produces better returns than investing in our children.
I&#39;ve been a strong supporter of the Head Start program&#44; which helped more than 3&#44;000 children and families in Westchester and Rockland last year.
Leading on animal welfare issues
Throughout my career in Congress&#44; I have made it a priority to protect our nation&#39;s animals from cruelty. That is why I am proud to have recently received the
Legislative Leader award from the Humane Society of the United States
&#40;HSUS&#41; for my perfect score on their 2014 Humane Scorecard and for my leadership on animal protection issues. I am especially proud to have received recognition for the Refuge from Cruel Trapping Act&#44; which I re&#45;introduced this year. My bill would ban the use of body&#45;gripping traps in any of our nation&#39;s wildlife refuges. I will continue be a leading proponent in the U.S. House of Representatives of policies that improve animal welfare.
Helping a Nyack constituent with the Social Security Administration
I take great pride in helping my constituents. Recently&#44; a Nyack man applied to be a certified plumber in New York City&#44; but still needed to supply an itemized statement of earnings from the Social Security Administration &#40;SSA&#41;. When he contacted SSA&#44; he was told he&#39;d have to wait four months because of a backlog of requests&#44; but his application would have expired by then. I contacted SSA and two days later received a copy of the earnings statement&#44; enabling him to fulfill the requirement for his license. If you need help with a federal&#44; please contact my White Plains office &#40;914&#45;428&#45;1707&#41;&#44; my New City office &#40;845&#45;639&#45;3485&#41;&#44; or visit my
