Dear Friends,
Education
is one of the most fundamental investments that we can make in our
future. As a mother and a grandmother, I am all too familiar with the
financial hardships working parents face when their children attend
college.
I also understand the importance of providing children
and young adults with the skills they need to compete in the global
marketplace. As a former educator and Florida Certified Teacher with an
Associate in Arts degree from Miami Dade College, a Bachelors and a
Masters from Florida International University and a doctorate in
education from the University of Miami, I understand that higher
education helped me open a realm of possibilities. Our South Florida
students deserve the same opportunities.
I'm infinitely
grateful for the support I received from my parents while in school and I'm
sure that I would not be the same person without it. During my time in
the Florida legislature, my colleagues and I, with the help of
Stanley Tate, created the Florida Prepaid College Plan. The plan allows
parents to lock in the cost of college at the current rate for use at
Floridas community colleges, public universities, and technical
schools. Established in 1987, the Florida Prepaid College Plan continues
to allow college applicants to access higher education, in a more
affordable manner. Enrollments for the 2014 Florida Prepaid College Plan
close this Friday, February 28 th
and you can visit
www.myfloridaprepaid.com
to enroll.
Even with a
Florida Prepaid College Plan, for too many in our community, college
may seem like a far-fetched dream. It is crucial that all prospective
college students take the necessary steps to plan and prepare. Federal
student aid programs can help cover costs through grants, loans and
work-study programs.
The Department of Education allows
students to fill out federal student aid forms
online . Open enrollment ends June 30 th , but some schools may
have different deadlines.
If you would like more
information on the federal student aid program, please feel free to contact
my office at (305) 668-2285. My staff and I are more than happy to
help you or someone you know reach their educational goals and
dreams.
In todays economy, providing children and young adults with
the skills they need to compete in the global marketplace is
essential. We must provide the next generation with the necessary intellectual
tools to succeed and ensure that our community and nation remain
strong. Todays investments in education serve as down payments on
tomorrows economic growth.
Making sure that our students have
access to a meaningful education is one of my fundamental goals. I have
been proud to support our students through my work in the United States
House of Representatives and look forward to continuing this
tradition.
Sincerely,
Ileana
