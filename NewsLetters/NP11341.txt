Working to
Rein in Executive Overreach
Dear Friend,
Our Founders crafted a Constitution with
limited and enumerated powers for each of
the three branches of government.
Unfortunately, the executive branch has
undertaken actions that reach far beyond
the powers granted to it. Our Constitution
prohibits the executive branch from
choosing which laws it will enforce, yet
these constitutional limits are being
expressly ignored to the point where this
Administration has effectively made law
without congressional consent. It is our
job as members of Congress to hold the
executive branch accountable so the rule of
law may be upheld and the separation of
powers may be maintained.
To that end, the House of
Representatives passed two pieces of
legislation last week to address this very
important issue, and it is my hope that our
colleagues in the Senate will join in our
effort by approving them as well.
H.R. 4138, the ENFORCE (Executive Needs
to Faithfully Observe and Respect
Congressional Enactments of the Law) Act,
would help re-establish the checks and
balances inherent in our Constitution by
putting in place a procedure to allow the
House or Senate to authorize a lawsuit
against the executive branch in the event
that it fails to faithfully execute the
law.
The second measure, H.R. 3973, the
Faithful Execution of the Law Act, promotes
transparency in the federal government by
requiring the Attorney General to report to
Congress when federal officials circumvent
the lawmaking process and implement their
own policies or fail to enforce the
law.
Both bills passed last week by the House
were approved with bipartisan support, and
that is the way it should be. This should
not be an issue that is divided among party
lines; it is simply a matter of restoring
the proper role of the executive to ensure
the law of the land is faithfully executed.
I look forward to following both bills
closely as they make their way through the
legislative process so that we may restore
the balance of power to our government and
preserve the foundation of our
Constitution.
