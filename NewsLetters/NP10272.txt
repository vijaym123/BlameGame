Dear
Friends,
I recently introduced the Truth in Advertising Act
(TIAA), along with my Congressional colleagues Lois Capps and Ted
Deutch, a bill that could help reduce the negative impact of digitally
altered or photoshopped images in advertising that are promoting
unrealistic body image expectations. Too often, these expectations lead to
tragic emotional, mental, and physical health problems, such as eating
disorders. According to a 2011 study, at least 30 million Americans
suffer from a clinically significant eating disorder at some point in
their lives.
Increasing amounts of academic evidence demonstrate
a link between images of very thin models in advertising and body
image issues, weight concerns, and eating habits. Exposure to these
images, combined with other factors such as genetic predisposition,
feelings of inadequacy, societal pressures and competition, depression, or
anxiety, can make an eating disorder even more likely.
If
enacted, the TIAA would have the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) work with
experts from the business, physical and mental health, and consumer
advocacy communities to find a strategy to reduce the impact of
advertising that promotes unrealistic body image expectations and report back
to Congress on how to best stop the destructive impact of this
practice. Input on the strategy and recommendations is required from a broad
spectrum of stakeholders, to ensure that artistic expression and the
freedom of media outlets will not be restricted.
While my
colleagues and I in Congress would prefer that the advertising industry
self-regulate similar to the alcoholic beverage industry, more and more
images in advertising are being digitally altered that promote
unrealistic body types. The TIAA does not impose new regulations but simply
asks the FTC, the government agency tasked with protecting consumers
from advertisements that affect their health or pocketbooks, to work with
stakeholders and make recommendations to Congress on how the impact
of digitally altered images could be reduced.
I am hopeful
that the TIAA can be a significant step in reducing the influence of
photoshopped ads, encouraging the advertising industry to self-regulate,
and helping to empower men and women with the truth so that they can
have healthy, realistic expectations of their bodies.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
