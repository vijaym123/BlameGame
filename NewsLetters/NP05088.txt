David, I really need to talk with you.
This afternoon, Vice President Biden asked you to support my campaign.
Since then, 154 of you have responded to his call-to-action! Thank you! But as of 9:45pm, we&rsquo;re still coming up 46 donations short ahead of our triple-match goal.
David, with only 8 days to go, we can&rsquo;t afford to miss this chance -- not if we&rsquo;re going to keep Illinois blue. So I have to ask:
will you chip in $5 or more to our campaign by midnight?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

Thanks for your continued support,
Cheri
P.S. Sorry for all these emails. I know it can be a lot, but your grassroots support will carry us across the finish line.
