The Congressional Connector
Week of June 15 - 21,
2014
House Votes for Faster Care for
Veterans
On June 10, the
House passed a bill [ H.R. 4810 ] to help alleviate
the backlog of veteran patients waiting to be seen at VA medical
facilities both for specialty care and primary care appointments.
This
bill would allow veterans who have had longer-than-average wait times
at VA medical centers to access care from private health care
providers for the next two years while service issues at VA hospitals are
corrected.
The House approved the bill on a unanimous vote of 426 to
0.
The Senate also recently approved an even more comprehensive
veterans health care bill.
Negotiators from the House and
Senate will meet soon to hammer out a final version of the
legislation.
Witness Wednesdays to Share Stories of Unemployed
Americans
On June 11, Rep. Levin and
other concerned members of the House of Representatives kicked off
the first in a series of Witness Wednesdays to share stories of
unemployed Americans who have been cut off of unemployment insurance.
This event was the first in a summer-long storytelling series at the
Capitol. Since the expiration of federal unemployment benefits in
December, three million Americans have been cut off of a vital lifeline,
leaving many struggling to make ends meet and keep food on the
table.

Rep. Levin Backs Bill to Address Gun
Violence
Last week, in a scene
that is becoming disturbingly familiar, a student at a high school in
Oregon shot and killed another student before taking his own
life.
On May 27, a young man in Isla Vista, California went on a killing
spree that killed 6 people and injured 13 others before committing
suicide.
Last September, 12 people were killed by a shooter at the
Washington Navy Yard.
In July 2012, 12 people were killed and 58
wounded at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado.
In December
2012, 27 were killed, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary
School.
There have been at least 74 school shootings since the
massacre in Sandy Hook, and 9 mass shootings in just the last two
weeks.
Rep. Levin has
joined over 40 Members of Congress in cosponsoring legislation
the
Promoting Healthy Minds for Safer Communities Act
that seeks to reduce
gun violence while improving our nations mental health system.
The bill takes a multi-prong approach by strengthening intervention
efforts, providing law enforcement with more tools to enforce existing
laws, boosts mental health research, and enhances information sharing
on gun violence.
This bill is one step toward preventing
gun violence in our communities.
