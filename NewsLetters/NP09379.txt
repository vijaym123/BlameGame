Memorial Day
Monday, May 26, 2014
Friends,
Marking the beginning of summer, Memorial Day for many is filled with outdoor barbeques, trips to the pool, and parades.
Most importantly, however, Memorial Day is when we pause and remember those who paid the ultimate price in defense of the American Dream.
We owe our freedoms and way of life to these brave men and women who stood together in defending us all, and to their families as well.
On this day and others throughout the year, we remember the fallen heroes and those who currently serve for their efforts in keeping us free and our nation strong.
May God continue to bless these United States.
Sincerely,
H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
Member of Congress
