Boehner just LOST IT!
BOEHNER :
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been president for five and a half years. WHEN IS HE GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING?&rdquo;
Is Speaker Boehner serious right now?! Let&rsquo;s recap:
But House Republicans have blocked President Obama every step of the way -- and now they&rsquo;re SUING him.
We&rsquo;ve had enough of it. And apparently, so have you!
That&rsquo;s
$2,993,000
and counting in online donations since Boehner announced he was suing President Obama!
