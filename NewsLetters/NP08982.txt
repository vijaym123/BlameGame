Wicker Opposes President
Obama's
Latest EPA Overreach
New Regulations Would
Increase Electricity
Rates, Hurt Economic
Growth
In 2010, President Obama's cap-and-trade legislation to
regulate carbon dioxide emissions failed in Congress.
The
President remarked that it was just "one way of skinning the cat."
Cap and trade, also known as "cap and tax," imposes a fee on the CO2
released during energy production, ultimately raising energy costs for
American households and businesses while doing nothing to make our air
cleaner.
Now, the President
is again trying to force a cap-and-trade scheme as part of his extreme
environmental agenda
this time bypassing Congress with
administrative action on carbon dioxide emissions through the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
On June 2, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy
outlined a new plan for reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power
plants, in which each state has to meet a specific target by 2030.
Mississippi, for example, would have to lower its emissions from 2005
levels by 38 percent.
Higher Energy Costs Threaten
American Livelihoods
I
opposed President Obama's first cap-and-trade effort, and I remain
committed to fighting this latest attempt to issue burdensome, job-killing
EPA regulations.
These regulations are not about cutting smog or
achieving cleaner air but about the effect that carbon dioxide
supposedly has on global temperatures.
The Obama Administration and
environmentalists should not confuse the issue and try to saddle
Americans with higher costs in the
process.
According to a recent report from the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, which evaluates the Administration's most aggressive CO2 reduction
goals, electricity rates could increase by $289 billion and cost a
typical household some $3,400 in disposable income over the next 15
years.
Higher rates would be particularly devastating for America's
poorest populations, who already spend nearly a quarter of their
paychecks on energy.
As I noted in a recent Senate Environment and
Public Works subcommittee hearing, the regulations would also negatively
impact entire industries, such as Mississippi's farmers, foresters,
and fishermen.
Focus Should Be on Job Creation, Economic
Investment
Rather than
disrupting energy reliability and affordability, the President should
be working with Congress to boost job creation and economic growth.
Policies that force coal-fired power plants to close would not
only limit America's energy portfolio but also drive away investment and
jobs.
U.S. competitiveness would be put at risk as
manufacturers are forced to sell goods at higher rates than their foreign
counterparts.
The same Chamber of Commerce study estimated that the
Administration's war on coal could kill an average 224,000 jobs each year
until 2030.
China Will Continue to Drive Up
Emissions
Projections about
environmental results are similarly disappointing.
Despite the damage done
to the U.S. economy, EPA's unprecedented overreach is expected to have
a minimal impact on climate change as countries like China and India
continue to be big polluters.
Former EPA Administrator Lisa
Jackson testified in 2009 that "U.S. action alone will not impact world CO2
levels."
In a recent interview with radio station WTOP,
University of Maryland professor Peter Morici said China's emissions would
surpass America's carbon dioxide savings in only 18
months.
I have joined 40 Senators, including Sen.
Thad Cochran, in urging President Obama to withdraw this misguided rule.
In our letter, we highlight his proposal's widespread harm,
burdening Americans with skyrocketing electricity rates and more economic
uncertainty.
We also challenge whether the Administration even
has the legal authority to issue such stringent mandates under the
Clean Air Act.
Coal, which
provides 37 percent of America's electricity, should not be prematurely
eliminated as an energy provider by regulations with negligible
benefits.
The President's radical environmental policies may satisfy
the aims of his political donors but they do not serve the best
interests of U.S. workers and job creators.
