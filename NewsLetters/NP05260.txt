I emailed yesterday. Now I&rsquo;m emailing again. I wouldn&rsquo;t do it, but time is running out. Six races are key to winning the Senate -- and each one is TIED right now.
Friend -- I emailed yesterday. Now I&rsquo;m emailing again.
I wouldn&rsquo;t do it, but time is running out.
Our FINAL two-week-out advertising buy deadline is midnight tonight!
Look:
Six races are key to winning the Senate -- and each one is TIED right now.
Republicans only need to win THREE for McConnell to take over.
That means our chances are 50-50 -- so close it&rsquo;s scary!
Tonight is the single biggest ad buy deadline of the entire election. What happens today WILL determine whether we can win. So I&rsquo;m pleading with you to dig deep and help us break the tie.
Friend, this is our last chance to beat the GOP. Will you pitch in? All gifts made before midnight&rsquo;s deadline will be triple-matched.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
or donate another amount.
The stakes in this election are much too high to leave up to chance.
An obstructionist Senate led by Mitch McConnell would be a disaster for working families.
But the GOP is fighting hard: They desperately want to avoid what
ABC News
reported would be &ldquo;the most crushing failure in recent political history&rdquo; -- especially after their heartbreaking Senate losses in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Their donors are pumping in last-minute cash.
So we need to fight back, break the tie, and take the win.
Are you in? Pitch in before tonight&rsquo;s ad buy deadline and every cent will be put toward a Democratic victory. And we&rsquo;ll even triple-match your gift!
Thank you for all you do,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
