Poliquin Praised for Effort to Add Business
Incentives at Former Brunswick Navy Base : On Thursday, the
House Armed Services Committee included an amendment,
which Congressman Poliquin helped
draft , into the National Defense Authorization Act that would help
adjust the requirements of the Historically Underutilized Business Zone
(HUBZone) program under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act.
Since the closing of Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maines
government, local and federal, has been working to help bring more jobs to
the community by establishing NASB as a HUBZone, said Representative
Poliquin. I was pleased to work with my colleague, Elise Stefanik on
this amendment to not only ensure that the former Brunswick base
qualifies as a HUBZone, but by extending the radius out 25 miles, it will
allow more constituents from the Second District to become eligible for
the workforce, will attract more businesses, and help put more Mainers
back to work. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will also
be successful is taking up a similar measure.
Child Support Assistance
Act : On Wednesday, Congressman Poliquin
introduced the Child Support Assistance Act with Congressman Keith
Ellison (D-MN).
Its imperative for Congress, Republicans and
Democrats, to work together and ensure that our kids have all the possible
opportunities to succeed and have a bright future. The Child Support
Assistance Act will help our state and local authorities in assisting
families to collect child support payments from delinquent
parents.
