Week in
Review
The education of our nations children is
the foundation for our success.
On Tuesday, I visited with the
many Third District educators that were in Washington, including Ecclesia
College President Oren Paris, Dr. Chip Pollard, President of John
Brown University, Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Benny
Gooden, and Fort Smith Public School Board President Jeannie Cole.
I
am grateful for your dedication to providing the best possible
education for our students.
Thanks for all you do and for visiting
Washington!
In case you missed it, on Tuesday afternoon, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office reported that, by 2017, Obamacare will reduce
Americas workforce by 2 million full-time jobs.
Since its
passage, Republicans have warned that the Affordable Care Act is a
job-killer and does little to curtail the rising cost of health care.
This report confirms it.
Instead of creating more red tape and
issuing more regulations that are burdening businesses across the
country, slowing our economic recovery, and stifling job creation, we must
get Washington out of the way
whether at the doctors office, in the
job market, or at the gas pump
to build an America that works.
Thats what Ill continue to work to do with my colleagues in
the House.
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 3590 , the Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act
of 2013, by a vote of 268-154. H.R. 3590 is a bipartisan package of
eight individual bills to protect the traditional right of American
sportsmen to fish and hunt.
It will remove government roadblocks to
these activities on certain public lands and guard against new
regulations that threaten to block or limit access to hunting and
fishing.
The bill protects American jobs and economic growth by supporting
recreational opportunities on these federal lands.
The House
also passed
H.R. 3964 , the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act.
H.R. 3964 addresses the
emergency drought in California by restoring some water supplies to provide
job certainty to farmers and communities.
Specifically, the
bill restores water deliveries to communities by codifying the historic,
bipartisan state/federal agreement known as the Bay-Delta Accord.
It reforms punitive federal law, like the Central Valley Project
Improvement Act and the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act,
in order to provide fairness to ratepayers, promote transparency and
accountability.
The bill also allows water users to pay off
federal debt early, which will bring early revenue to the U.S. Treasury, and
protects and secures private property and senior water rights.
Wednesday evening, I hosted a teletown hall.
I
enjoyed the opportunity to talk about whats happening in Washington and to
hear your concerns.
Thanks to everyone who listened in and
participated!
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R.
2954 , the Public Access and Lands Improvement Act, by a vote of 220-194.
H.R. 2954 is a bipartisan package of ten bills that protect and
promote public access to lands and improve opportunities by removing
red tape that stands in the way of responsible, local economic
development and jobs, and encourages transparent, community-centered land
management.
Thanks to all of the other Arkansans who visited my
office this week.
It was great to see the Enlisted Association
of the Arkansas National Guard, the Arkansas Law Enforcement Officers,
the Southwestern Energy Company, the Northwest Arkansas Tobacco and
Drug Free Coalition, the Building Owners and Managers Association, Mark
Hayes of the Arkansas Municipal League, and Carol Fleming of the
Arkansas Education Association.
Safe travels back to
Arkansas!
