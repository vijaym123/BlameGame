Dear David,
In preparation for the April 15th tax filing deadline, I&rsquo;m sharing a list of resources that may be helpful when filing your federal tax return.
I also want to alert you about a possible IRS phone scam targeting seniors.
Tax Resources
Filing your taxes can be a stressful time. Please find below some information that may be helpful for you and your family.
Get Free Advice
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) are IRS programs that help those over the age of 60 or those who make less than $53,000 a year file their taxes. Please visit:

IRS Phone Scam
My office has received reports from constituents who received calls from people claiming to be IRS employees. These supposed IRS representatives falsely accuse you of owing back taxes and threaten you with fees or jail time if you don&rsquo;t submit a payment to them. Often times, they will even ask for your Social Security number and bank account information.
Note: The IRS will NEVER ask for your personal information or collect payments over the phone.
The IRS will only contact you via U.S. mail.
If you receive a call similar to this, please contact my office immediately at (562) 860-5050. My staff will help you report the calls to the proper authorities.
If you have any other questions about the IRS or any other federal agency, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Best,
Linda T. S&aacute;nchez
