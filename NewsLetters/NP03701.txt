Friends,
Its hard to believe that weve reached the
end of my first term serving you in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
Nearly two years ago, when I placed my hand on the Bible and
was sworn in as your representative with my wife Renee by my side, I
was humbled and eager to get to work.
Theres no doubt that
these past two years have been a roller coaster ride, but it has been
such an honor to serve our district and be your voice in
Washington.
Weve experienced plenty of
challenges together
unacceptable conditions
at the
Department of Veteran Affairs (VA),
an uprising of
radical Islamic extremists worldwide , and a humanitarian and national
security
crisis at our southern border
- to name a
few. Perhaps just as troubling is the dangerous and unprecedented
abuse of executive power
by the Obama
Administration.
After the clear rejection of his agenda in November,
President Obama has continued to push his failed policies and ignore the
priorities of the American
people.
But as trying as these moments have been, weve
accomplished plenty of feats in North Carolina and the Eighth
District.
By far my favorite part of being your representative has been
implementing
a top-notch constituent service
operation
to help folks right here at home. As frustrating as it is to see the
bureaucratic hoops people have to go through when trying to deal with
agencies like the Social Security Administration or the VA, it is
just as satisfying when were able to track down
long-lost war medals for the family of a Korean War veteran
or help an
elderly lady in Ellerbe get the Social Security benefits she had earned
through decades of hard work.
Weve been able to help
thousands of constituents cut through bureaucratic red tape, and Im proud of
the work weve done thus
far.
When I first ran for Congress, I promised you I would be
someone who tried to work across the aisle to get things done for our
country and for our district.
To this end, I was able to get
two bills passed unanimously by both the House and Senate and
signed into law
by President Obama. These bipartisan
reforms to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) enact
conservative reforms that will end up saving us tens of millions of our tax
dollars.
With your help and guidance, Ive had other successes
advancing solutions that directly impact our local
communities,
including getting Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to
commit to repairing the damaged roads in the Uwharrie Forest
and
preventing devastating cuts to contract
control towers at our regional
airports .
I also
promised our farmers
that I would
get them a 5-year Farm Bill and work to rein in inefficient regulations.
Im thrilled that we were able to get the
Farm Bill
across the finish line
this year to equip our agriculture
community with the tools and certainty they need to produce an affordable and
stable food supply. Weve also made substantial strides to protect our
farmers from the overregulation of the EPA
cutting another $60
million from their budget,
rolling back their
bureaucratic staff to 1989 levels
and blocking them from doing things like
regulating irrigation
ditches.
While Im honored by what weve accomplished together thus
far, there is still a lot of work to be done.
I made a promise
to you that I would work hard to advance solutions that increase
economic prosperity, reduce our debt and bring jobs home to North
Carolina. In the 113th Congress, I have strived to keep that promise and
define myself not only by my actions as someone who fights for you, but by
my results as someone who can affect needed change.
As we head
into the new year and the 114th Congress, I remain committed to
keeping this promise, to making myself as accessible as possible and
representing you the best that I
can.
Until next
week,
Richard Hudson
