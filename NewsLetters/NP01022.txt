Rubio Calls For Up Or Down Votes On
Important Iran Amendments
Marco
delivered
remarks on the floor
of the U.S.
Senate Thursday urging consideration of
two amendments he has sponsored regarding
the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of
2015.
The
first
amendment
would require that
President Obama certify when he submits
the nuclear deal to Congress that Iran
has publicly recognized Israel's right to
exist as a Jewish state. The
second
amendment
would prohibit sanctions
relief under an agreement with Iran until
Iran has fully and verifiably implemented
all of the requirements contained in the
White House April 2
nd outline of Parameters
for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
regarding the Islamic Republic of
Irans Nuclear Program.
Rubio: And so the reason why
the existence of Israel as a Jewish
state is directly tied to this deal is
simple -- we are about to turn over
billions of dollars into their hands
and we have every reason to believe
that they will spend a significant
portion of that money to destroy our
strongest and most important ally in
the region and one of our most
important allies in the world. And so
the first amendment I have offered is
pretty straightforward. It calls for
any deal to require that Iran recognize
Israel's right to exist as a Jewish
state.
The second amendment I
will propose is even more
straightforward, even more on point.
Here's what it requires. It requires
that this final deal be the deal the
president says it is. Here's what I
mean by that. I filed an amendment that
basically took the White House's own
fact sheet. And, by the way, I have
problems with that fact sheet. The deal
as the president describes it is not a
deal that I believe will work. It's not
a deal that I believe will prevent Iran
from acquiring a nuclear weapon. But
just to take them at their word, just
to prove this point and to ensure that
we are building safeguards into what we
are doing here, I took the White
House's own fact sheet, what they said
the deal was about, and I say from this
amendment that the final deal must be
about those points, that the White
House already says it is.
Marco also
wrote
an op-ed
about the danger of
President Obamas desperation to
make a deal with Iran.
Earlier this week,
Marco
joined six of his colleagues in a
letter
to Director of National
Intelligence James R. Clapper, Jr.
expressing concern that the 2015
Worldwide Threat Assessment did not fully
represent Irans state sponsorship
of terrorism globally and asked that he
provide an unclassified assessment of
Irans support for terrorism and
the threat posed by Shia militants. They
also asked whether this information was
in previous drafts of the assessment, any
justifications for removing the
information and who made the decision to
do so
As ObamaCare Bailout Possibility
Grows, Rubio Calls For Repeal Of
Bailout Program
Marco issued
the
following statement
regarding credit
rating agency
Standard
&amp; Poors new report
that
ObamaCares risk corridor program
is significantly
underfunded:
Rubio: This report confirms,
once again, that ObamaCare is not
working the way it was sold and the
so-called risk corridor provision must
go. Taxpayers should not have to fund
bailouts to protect the profits of the
insurance companies that helped write
ObamaCare. The legislation Ive
introduced will protect Americans from
yet another corporate bailout that puts
them on the hook for Washingtons
mistakes.
In January, Marco introduced
The
ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention
Act , a bill that would
eliminate the provision of ObamaCare that
allows for taxpayer-funded bailouts of
insurance companies at the Obama
Administrations sole
discretion.
Rubio: Asia Needs A Strong
U.S.-Japan Alliance
Following Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abes address to a joint
session of Congress, Marco wrote an op-ed
about the need for a strong U.S.-Japan
alliance.
Read an excerpt of the op-ed below and
the full version
here .
Rubio: Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abes visit to
the United States this week highlights
the potential of a new age of peace and
prosperity in Asia. Under his
leadership, Japan is revising its
defense policies to become a more
robust contributor to security in East
Asia, working with partners to ensure
that territorial disputes are resolved
through the rule of law, and attempting
to finalize the Trans-Pacific
Partnership trade pact. These goals are
shared by the United States and should
have our full support.
Our alliance with Japan is
key to a 21st-century Asia free and at
peace.
Rubio, Casey Introduce Resolution
Highlighting Importance Of Press
Freedom
Marco and Senator Bob Casey (D-PA)
introduced
S.Res.
152 , highlighting the importance of
press freedom around the world.
The
bipartisan resolution
recognizes the
dangers that reporters face and reaffirms
freedom of the press as a priority for
the U.S. government.
Rubio: While our world today
is more open and connected than ever
before, repressive governments continue
targeting journalists and media outlets
in order to cover up their own
corruption, brutality and incompetence.
The U.S. cannot overlook assaults on
press freedom like
the
latest case in Iran
where The
Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian
is languishing in an Iranian jail cell
because of his profession as a
reporter. On a day dedicated to
promoting a free and independent press,
we are reminded the U.S. must stand
with independent journalists being
persecuted around the world.
According to the Committee to Protect
Journalists, 221 journalists worldwide
were in prison as of December 1, 2014,
including
The
Washington Post
reporter Jason
Rezaian, who remains jailed in Iran.
According to the Committee to Protect
Journalists, in 2014 Syria was the
worlds deadliest country for
journalists for the third year in a row.
A PDF of the resolution is available
here ,
and the full text is below.
Constituent Casework Corner
Marjorie, a resident of Ocala, was
supposed to receive a Social Security
check at the beginning of February, but
it never came. Senator Rubios

Administration to inquire on her behalf,
and within two weeks the SSA had issued
Marjorie a critical payment to replace
the one that was not received.
