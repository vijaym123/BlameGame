A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
February 2, 2014
Dear friends,
Some weeks are driven by one or two topics of significance, this week
there are five. From the President's State of the Union Address to my
ongoing efforts to try to bring much needed relief to Wisconsinites
during the propane crisis, below is a round-up of five things you need
to know:
1.
The State of the Union lacked energy. The President struck a more
bipartisan tone in his fifth State of the Union address. This was a
good thing. We need to find common ground so we can get things done,
grow our economy and look to the private sector to create jobs.
However, I wish the President had expanded his bipartisan jobs agenda
to include a commitment to building the Keystone XL pipeline. It would
create thousands of American jobs, bolster our North American energy
independence, and help prevent future home heating crises like the one
we are currently experiencing in Wisconsin.
Also, as I told Fox's Sean Hannity, the President talked about people
who did not have health insurance before Obamacare, but he failed to
mention the millions of Americans who lost their health insurance
because of Obamacare. Click on the image to watch the full clip:
2.
Immediate assistance and long-term solutions: While the President
did not mention it in address this week, during his visit to our state
following the speech, the President witnessed the extreme cold that
Wisconsinites have now been dealing with for over a month. These record
low temperatures have led to record high home heating prices in our
state, and we are in need of relief. Here is what we have been able to
accomplish thus far:
I have worked with USDOT to obtain a waiver for trucking hours
of service for propane drivers. I will continue to work with the
Administration to extend that exemption.
I also worked with the Northeast-Midwest Institute to encourage
the Administration to expedite the release of remaining LIHEAP funds
for Fiscal Year 2014. We received notice this week that $14.2 million
in LIHEAP grants has been released to help Wisconsinites meet their
energy costs.
Finally, the entire Wisconsin delegation urged the President
to continue to provide additional relief for our state. I
am hopeful that he and the Administration will heed our request.
3. Your privacy must remain a priority: The Director of the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Richard Cordray, again appeared
before the Financial Services Committee this week. Once again, he tried
to convince the committee that it is necessary for the CFPB to collect
and monitor your personal financial information and to do so without
first obtaining your permission. This is wrong. The
Washington Examiner
included my exchange in a piece that appeared on The Drudge Report:
"Would you object to getting permission from consumers, those people
who you work for, before you collect and monitor their information?"
Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., asked Cordray.
"That would make it impossible to get the data," Cordray replied."

4. Keep talking: Earlier this month hundreds of constituents from
Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District descended on our nation's
capital to give a voice to the unborn. While I was back home hosting
town halls around the District, I enjoyed following the tweets, status
messages and Instragrams throughout the day. Our challenge is to keep
the conversation going.
On the Federal level, I am going to continue to do all I can to protect
the Judeo-Christian values on which our country was founded. This week
I voted in favor of H.R. 7, The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Full
Disclosure Act of 2014. Watch this short video below to hear about the
other efforts I am pursuing and find out how you can get involved and
help us spread the word!
5.
See you tomorrow: Tomorrow morning I will host a town hall
in Lincoln county. If you are in the area, please join me to discuss
the work I am doing on your behalf and talk about the issues that are
on your mind:
Monday, February 3, 2014; 7:00 - 8:00 AM

1603 Champagne Street Merrill, WI 54452. Merrill
That's a wrap-up of the five things you need to know this week. Until
next week, have a great week.

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
February 2, 2014
Dear
friends,
Some
weeks
are
driven
by
one
or
two
topics
of
significance,
this
week
there
are
five.
From
the
President&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
Address
to
my
ongoing
efforts
to
try
to
bring
much
needed
relief
to
Wisconsinites
during
the
propane
crisis,
below
is
a
round-up
of
five
things
you
need
to
know:
1.
The
State
of
the
Union
lacked
energy.
The
President
struck
a
more
bipartisan
tone
in
his
fifth
State
of
the
Union
address.
This
was
a
good
thing.
We
need
to
find
common
ground
so
we
can
get
things
done,
grow
our
economy
and
look
to
the
private
sector
to
create
jobs.
However,
I
wish
the
President
had
expanded
his
bipartisan
jobs
agenda
to
include
a
commitment
to
building
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline.
It
would
create
thousands
of
American
jobs,
bolster
our
North
American
energy
independence,
and
help
prevent
future
home
heating
crises
like
the
one
we
are
currently
experiencing
in
Wisconsin.
Also,
as
I
told
Fox&#8217;s
Sean
Hannity,
the
President
talked
about
people
who
did
not
have
health
insurance
before
Obamacare,
but
he
failed
to
mention
the
millions
of
Americans
who
lost
their
health
insurance
because
of
Obamacare.

Immediate
assistance
and
long-term
solutions:
While
the
President
did
not
mention
it
in
address
this
week,
during
his
visit
to
our
state
following
the
speech,
the
President
witnessed
the
extreme
cold
that
Wisconsinites
have
now
been
dealing
with
for
over
a
month.
These
record
low
temperatures
have
led
to
record
high
home
heating
prices
in
our
state,
and
we
are
in
need
of
relief.
Here
is
what
we
have
been
able
to
accomplish
thus
far:
&#183;
I
have
worked
with
USDOT
to
obtain
a
waiver
for
trucking
hours
of
service
for
propane
drivers.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
the
Administration
to
extend
that
exemption.
&#183;
I
also
worked
with
the
Northeast-Midwest
Institute
to
encourage
the
Administration
to
expedite
the
release
of
remaining
LIHEAP
funds
for
Fiscal
Year
2014.
We
received
notice
this
week
that
$14.2
million
in
LIHEAP
grants
has
been
released
to
help
Wisconsinites
meet
their
energy
costs.
&#183;
Finally,
the
entire
Wisconsin
delegation
urged
the
President
to
continue
to
provide
additional
relief
for
our
state.
I
am
hopeful
that
he
and
the
Administration
will
heed
our
request.

Y o ur
privacy
must
remain
a
priority:
The
Director
of
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB),
Richard
Cordray,
again
appeared
before
the
Financial
Services
Committee
this
week.
Once
again,
he
tried
to
convince
the
committee
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
CFPB
to
collect
and
monitor
your
personal
financial
information
and
to
do
so
without
first
obtaining
your
permission.
This
is
wrong.
The
Washington
Examiner
included
my
exchange
in
a
piece
that
appeared
on
The
Drudge
Report:
"Would
you
object
to
getting
permission
from
consumers,
those
people
who
you
work
for,
before
you
collect
and
monitor
their
information?"
Rep.
Sean
Duffy,
R-Wis.,
asked
Cordray.
"That
would
make
it
impossible
to
get
the
data,"
Cordray
replied.&#8221;

Keep

Earlier
this
month
hundreds
of
constituents
from
Wisconsin&#8217;s
7 th
Congressional
District
descended
on
our
nation&#8217;s
capital
to
give
a
voice
to
the

While
I
was
back
home
hosting
town
halls
around
the
District,
I
enjoyed

the

Our

I
am
going
to
continue
to
do
all
I
can
to
protect
the
Judeo-Christian
values
on
which
our

was
founded.
This

I
