Dear Friends,
Id like to update you on two important pieces of legislation that will greatly impact many folks in our area.
Private property rights are vital to our American way of life. It is the foundation for our homes, our livelihoods, and our opportunity to provide a better future for coming generations. That is why alarms sounded when rights to Texas land were called into question by the federal government. Senator Cornyn and I introduced legislation to help protect the property rights of landowners who own property along the Red River that was claimed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Many of these land owners possess deeds and have been paying taxes on this property for decades.
Originally claiming 90,000 acres along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River, the BLM has now lowered its estimates of land it may own to 30,000 acres. Only 6,402 of those acres have actually been surveyed by the federal government.
The Red River Private Property Protection Act ( H.R. 2130 ) seeks to eliminate any cloud of uncertainty for landowners once and for all. For more detailed information,

Recently, I cosponsored another bill, the Rural Veterans Travel Enhancement Act of 2015, ( H.R. 2291 ), that would permanently authorize the VAs ability to transport veterans to and from their healthcare appointments. It is a cost-effective program to help veterans access healthcare by saving on ambulance costs and offering mileage reimbursements.
This program allowed the Amarillo VA to transport 6,047 veterans to and from appointments between October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015.
This bill also reauthorizes a grant program for five years to support Veterans Services Organizations that transport veterans in highly rural areas who are seeking medical care, like many in our area. I also adds new mileage reimbursement for veterans traveling to Vet Centers, where they can receive post-war readjustment counseling.
Improving veteran access to healthcare does not only mean having enough providers. It requires us to ensure that veterans are able to get to their appointments with those providers. We owe it to those who faithfully served our country. For more detailed information,

I will continue to keep you updated on these bills and other legislation as the year progresses. You can watch my latest video mailbox about them by following the link below.
