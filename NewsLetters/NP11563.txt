Great Week for the Great Lakes
president obama signs the 2014 farm bill at michigan state
university
Despite the dreary late winter weather, sunny days on the lakeshore
occupied the minds of those gathered in Washington to celebrate Great
Lakes Day. The annual event brings together stakeholders from 125
organizations with their elected leaders to discuss the environmental
and economic importance of restoring and protecting the Great Lakes.
Senator Stabenow told the group about the Regional Conservation
Partnership Program, a provision of the just-signed 2014 Farm bill that
was crafted with the Great Lakes in mind, and she joined the group in
honoring Senator Carl Levin. "Throughout his career, Senator Levin has
been a true champion of the Great Lakes," she said, noting his tenure as
co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force since 1999 and how instrumental
he was in establishing and funding the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative.
Clearing the Dredging Backlog
Senators Stabenow and Levin have been at the forefront of addressing the
backlog of dredging projects in the Great Lakes.
They joined together
on a letter from Great Lakes Senators to the Army Corps of Engineers
urging more funding for Great Lakes harbor maintenance from the $200
million in national funding passed in this year's budget. Last week we
learned that the Army Corps of Engineers will distribute $25 million of
the additional money for Great Lakes navigation projects. "Making sure
that our harbors and waterways are properly dredged and maintained is
absolutely critical to supporting Michigan's shipping, boating, and
tourism industries," Senator Stabenow said, adding, "this is much-needed
funding that will go a long way to supporting our economy and thousands
of jobs across our state."

Generations to Come
And to top off a great week for the Great Lakes, the House of
Representatives passed the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore
Conservation and Recreation Act, a bill Michigan's Senators introduced
in 2013.
"The Dunes bring 1.2 million visitors a year to Michigan from
across the country. By designating this wilderness land, we are helping
promote one of our state's top Pure Michigan tourist attractions and
protecting an integral part of our Great Lakes," Stabenow said.
