Dear Friend,
Following Election Day, President Obama
said that he is eager to work with
the new Congress. However, this past
week President Obama announced that he will
once again circumvent Congress by acting
unilaterally on immigration. Though
President Obama has stated more than 20
times that he lacks the constitutional
authority to change our immigration laws,
he is doing just that.
In an address to the American people
last Thursday, President Obama outlined his
sweeping executive action. Under his plan,
five million unauthorized immigrants would
be granted work permits and temporary
reprieve from deportation. Additionally, he
intends to strengthen the visa programs
aimed at highly skilled immigrant workers
and entrepreneurs.
While there are portions of the
Presidents plan that I could
support, such as reforming current visa
programs for STEM graduates and highly
skilled workers, any unilateral action on
immigration is a nonstarter for real
reform. If we want to fix our broken
immigration system, we need to work
together.
In August, the House of Representatives
acted to address the crisis at our southern
border by providing President Obama with
the necessary resources to enforce our
current laws and strengthen border
security. Over the past few years, the
House Judiciary Committee has held several
hearings on immigration and has already
passed several bills that are key to
reforming immigration policy. This includes
legislation that reinforces our current
immigration laws, expands E-Verify
nation-wide, improves high-skilled
immigration programs, and creates a new,
reliable temporary agricultural
guest-worker program. The House will
continue to work through the traditional
legislative process. Immigration reform
will have a significant impact on our
economy and our workforce; we need to get
it right.
I firmly believe substantial policy
decisions deserve the accountability,
transparency, and scrutiny that open debate
and the legislative process provide. Rather
than work with Congress to reform current
immigration policy, President Obama has
chosen to play party politics and bypass
the legislative branch. While the House of
Representatives examines all options to
challenge President Obamas executive
overreach, I strongly urge him to work with
Congress - not against us - to reform our
immigration policy.
