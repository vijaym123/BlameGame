TODAY: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
TRIPLE-MATCH Eligible Location: 60659
This week started with HORRIBLE news...
A
New York Times
poll showed Democrats losing&hellip; a Republican mega-donor gave $10 MILLION to Karl Rove to knock us out entirely&hellip; But then President Obama asked for your help -- and YOU STEPPED UP!
Over 49,OOO of you have chipped in -- and that&rsquo;s just in the last 2 days.
President Obama will be so proud!
The goal is in sight: If we can bring in 937 more donations tonight, we can climb our way out of this fundraising hole and tip this election back toward the Democrats.
This is your last chance to get your support for President Obama triple-matched. You don't want to miss it.
