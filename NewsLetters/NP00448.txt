Dear Friend,
Late last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its
revised guidance to federal law enforcement on racial profiling.
While
the new guidelines included much-needed improvements, I believe
significant work remains to realize former Attorney General Eric
Holders goal of eliminating racial profiling once and for all.
Thats why I recently signed a letter urging the DOJ to update the
profiling guidance for law enforcement. The 2014 guidelines send a
signal of federal concern, but they are not a replacement for the
enactment of a comprehensive federal anti-profiling program.
I am
advocating for legislation that would ban profiling by federal, state,
and local law enforcement, provide a mechanism for enforcement of this
ban, mandate data collection by state and local law enforcement
agencies that receive federal funds, and provide financial and
technical support from the Department of Justice to law enforcement
agencies to ensure that the best practices are deployed to fight
unconstitutional profiling as outlined in the End Racial Profiling Act.
I am committed to working with my colleagues and the Administration to
ensure that everyone is treated equally and fairly before the law.
It
is an honor to serve you in Washington, if you have any questions,
please feel free to contact my office.
Your Friend,
Andr
