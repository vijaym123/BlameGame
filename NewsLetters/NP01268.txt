LEGISLATION
April 26, 2015
Dear David,
Earlier this month, both the House and the Senate introduced
legislation
to reauthorize Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA), a procedure Congress uses to grant the President
authority to enter into trade agreements for a limited period of time in
order to eliminate trade barriers in foreign markets and increase
foreign trade. If passed, TPA would allow the President to continue
negotiations without direct Congressional input, though Congress could
withdraw the authorization at any time. Do you believe Congress should reauthorize
TPA? No.
Congress should retain full control of trade agreements and should not
grant the President Trade Promotion Authority to enter into trade
agreements.
Yes.
Congress should grant the President Trade Promotion Authority to enter into
trade agreements.
Congress should grant the President Trade Promotion Authority
only if Congress remains in control of implementing trade legislation
and can withdraw TPA procedures if the administration does not adhere to
the agreed upon obligations. Need More Information. Please share any additional
thoughts or comments you have. *By
