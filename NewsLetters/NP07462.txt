Dear Friend, Ed&rsquo;s team is facing a $35,000 fundraising deadline at midnight tomorrow, and so far, we&rsquo;re about $5,655 short -- can you help us close the gap?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I know I say that every deadline is critical -- and as overblown as that might sound, it&rsquo;s true. Like a business, our campaign has a budget, and if actual revenue doesn&rsquo;t match or exceed projected revenue, we have some tough choices to make.
And here&rsquo;s the thing:
I don&rsquo;t want to have to decide how to scale back Ed&rsquo;s campaign.
There's too much at stake for the people of Massachusetts and across the country for us to run anything less than a first-class campaign operation.
That&rsquo;s where you come in. While Ed&rsquo;s fighting for the middle class in Washington, it&rsquo;s up to his grassroots supporters to give his campaign the resources it needs.
Put your shoulder to the wheel -- give $5 right now and help us reach our $35,000 goal by midnight tomorrow.
Thanks for standing by Ed.
