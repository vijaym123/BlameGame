Dear Friend,
In Massachusetts, the most popular political party is &ldquo;unenrolled.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s true --
there are more independents than both Democrats and Republicans combined in the Bay State.
In theory, we&rsquo;re a blue state, but Republican governors have occupied the corner office on Beacon Hill for 16 of the last 23 years. That fact should send a clear message to us Democrats --
we can never take any election for granted. Our campaign is working hard every day to make sure Massachusetts has a Senator it deserves -- can you contribute $5 to help keep our grassroots network growing?

Or donate another amount.
Turn on a TV near Boston and count the political ads you see. It&rsquo;s only May, and we&rsquo;re already starting to see a deluge of ads from special interest groups, like those backed by the Big Oil Koch brothers.
Republicans aren&rsquo;t just throwing away their money on ads in an expensive media market --
they&rsquo;re running these ads because they believe they can win here in November.
And it&rsquo;s up to us to stop them.
Kick in $5, $10, or whatever makes sense to you.
The Senate&rsquo;s at stake this year. I&rsquo;m not taking this race for granted, and I know you aren&rsquo;t either. Let&rsquo;s get to work.
Sincerely,
Ed
