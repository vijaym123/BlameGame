News from Representative John Delaney
March 16, 2014
Dear Friend,
This month, Congress and the White House took critical action to bring
private sector efficiency, innovation, and a focus on outcomes to the
federal government. Before the release of the President's budget last
week, I led Members of Congress in a letter to the White House
requesting support for the Pay for Success model, a method for
improving social services, like education, with private sector
investment. As a Member who has pushed both parties to build on private
market insight and expertise, I was excited to see the inclusion of Pay
for Success in the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2015 (FY15).
Please take a moment to let me know how you think our government can
improve social services for the country.
The Pay for Success model, also known as Social Impact Bonds,
identifies a policy goal which reduces long-term costs for the
government and improves results. For example, initiatives could improve
early education programs in order to reduce education costs for older
students down the road, or encourage preventative care in order to
decrease public expenses for costly emergency room visits.
Initial financing for a Pay for Success project comes from private
investors rather than the government with the stipulation that if the
project fails to reduce long-term spending, the government pays
nothing. If the project succeeds, the government pays the startup cost
plus a modest interest rate. Because the Pay for Success model is
founded on future government savings through smart social investments,
taxpayers are never left on the hook for more government spending.
Having spent two decades working in the private sector, I understand
the effectiveness of private market principles, and I've pushed Members
of Congress and the White House to embrace Pay for Success. On February
28, I joined with Representative Jared Polis to lead thirteen other
Members of Congress in a letter to the President
, asking
him to include funding for Social Impact Bonds in the FY15 Budget. I
also authored an op-ed
in The
Hill as part of my work to bring attention to the issue. When the White
House budget for FY15 was published last Tuesday, I was happy to see it
included $300 million to fund Pay for Success initiatives in areas like
workforce development, education, juvenile justice and care of children
with disabilities.
I'm a strong believer that we can work towards better government by
learning from the private sector principles. Improved efficiency, a
drive to innovate and an attention to outcomes can help us make
government programs reach farther and get their faster with a smaller
budget. As I continue to take a stand for good government and
commonsense solutions like Pay for Success, I welcome your feedback. My
work in Washington depends on constituent input, and I look forward to
hearing from you
.
Sincerely,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney
March
16,
2014
Dear
Friend,
This
month,
Congress
and
the
White
House
took
critical
action
to
bring
private
sector
efficiency,
innovation,
and
a
focus
on
outcomes
to
the
federal
government.
Before
the
release
of
the
President&#8217;s
budget
last
week,
I
led
Members
of
Congress
in
a
letter
to
the
White
House
requesting
support
for
the
Pay
for
Success
model,
a
method
for
improving
social
services,
like
education,
with
private
sector
investment.
As
a
Member
who
has
pushed
both
parties
to
build
on
private
market
insight
and
expertise,
I
was
excited
to
see
the
inclusion
of
Pay
for
Success
in
the
President&#8217;s
Budget
for
Fiscal
Year
2015
(FY15).
Please
take
a
moment
to
let
me
know
how you think our government can improve social services for the country.
The
Pay
for
Success
model,
also
known
as
Social
Impact
Bonds,
identifies
a
policy
goal
which
reduces
long-term
costs
for
the
government
and
improves
results.
For
example,
initiatives
could
improve
early
education
programs
in
order
to
reduce
education
costs
for
older
students
down
the
road,
or
encourage
preventative
care
in
order
to
decrease
public
expenses
for
costly
emergency
room
visits.
Initial
financing
for
a
Pay
for
Success
project
comes
from
private
investors
rather
than
the
government
with
the
stipulation
that
if
the
project
fails
to
reduce
long-term
spending,
the
government
pays
nothing.
If
the
project
succeeds,
the
government
pays
the
startup
cost
plus
a
modest
interest
rate.
Because
the
Pay
for
Success
model
is
founded
on
future
government
savings
through
smart
social
investments,
taxpayers
are
never
left
on
the
hook
for
more
government
spending.
Having
spent
two
decades
working
in
the
private
sector,
I
understand
the
effectiveness
of
private
market
principles,
and
I&#8217;ve
pushed
Members
of
Congress
and
the
White

to
embrace
Pay
for
Success.

I

Jared

FY15
Budget.
I

an

The

as
part
of
my
work
to
bring

to
the
issue.
When
the
White

was
published
last

I
was
happy
to
see
it
included
$300

to
fund
Pay
for

initiatives
in
areas
like
workforce

education,
juvenile

and
care
of
children
with

I&#8217;m
