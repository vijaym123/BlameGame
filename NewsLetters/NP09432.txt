Fighting For Our Tennessee Veterans
Dear Friends,
As the mother, wife, and daughter of U.S. veterans, I believe our
country has no greater responsibility than providing for our national
defense and supporting the brave men and women who fight to protect our
freedoms.
Our commitment to the nation's service members and their families must
be one that is carried out both in word and in deed. That is why I have
hosted veterans' job fairs across our district, supported legislation
such as the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act, voted to repeal cuts to
veterans' COLAs, and, just this week, voted for the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 to give our troops a much needed
pay raise and ensure our military has the tools necessary to keep
Americans safe.
Sadly, we have recently seen too many recent examples of Washington
failing to keep its promise to veterans. Many of you have heard about
the 40 veterans who reportedly died
at
one Arizona facility alone because they couldn't get the care our
government promised them. Similarly, seven hospitals around the country
are
alleged to have hidden lists of veterans waiting for treatment.
The truth is, these problems at the VA have been building under the
surface for some time. According to The Washington Times
,
"Veterans Affairs officials warned the Obama-Biden transition team in
the weeks after the 2008 presidential election that the department
shouldn't trust the wait times that its facilities were reporting."
This is a glaring contradiction to White House Press Secretary Jay
Carney's earlier claim
that the
president first learned of troubles at the VA through the media.
The White House says President Obama is "madder than hell" about the
reports of negligence at the VA. Coming from a military family, I'm mad
too-we all should be-but it will take more than anger to address the
systemic lack of accountability at the VA. It requires action.
Where Obama has failed to act, Congress has stood in the gap. In July,
I personally wrote
VA Secretary Eric
Shinseki to call attention to his agency's inefficiency. More recently,
the House voted with my support to create a task force charged with
addressing the unacceptable VA claims backlog - a bill that is still
awaiting a vote in the Senate despite its overwhelming 404-1 passage
in our
chamber. These are important first steps, but the latest instances of
neglect at the VA show that more needs to be done.
To that end, the House of Representatives acted this week by passing
the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of
2014
,
bipartisan legislation I co-sponsored allowing the VA secretary to fire
underperforming agency executives without going through the maze of
bureaucratic red tape typically required to terminate an administration
appointee. The Senate should follow the House's lead and immediately
take up this measure so that our veterans are protected.
Congress' oversight into the VA is ongoing, and we are prepared to take
our efforts all the way up the chain of command based on where the
facts lead. Our veterans have fulfilled their commitment to our country
in ways that most of us can only imagine. It is our job in Congress to
ensure that Washington upholds its end of the bargain.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress

Fighting
For
Our
Tennessee
Veterans
Dear
Friends,
As
the
mother,
wife,
and
daughter
of
U.S.
veterans,
I
believe
our
country
has
no
greater
responsibility
than
providing
for
our
national
defense
and
supporting
the
brave
men
and
women
who
fight
to
protect
our
freedoms.
Our
commitment
to
the
nation&#8217;s
service
members
and
their
families
must
be
one
that
is
carried
out
both
in
word
and
in
deed.
That
is
why
I
have
hosted
veterans&#8217;
job
fairs
across
our
district,
supported
legislation
such
as
the
Veterans
Opportunity
to
Work
Act,
voted
to
repeal
cuts
to
veterans&#8217;
COLAs,
and,
just
this
week,
voted
for
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
for
Fiscal
Year
2015
to
give
our
troops
a
much
needed
pay
raise
and
ensure
our
military
has
the
tools
necessary
to
keep
Americans
safe.
Sadly,
we
have
recently
seen
too
many
recent
examples
of
Washington
failing
to
keep
its
promise
to
veterans.
Many
of
you
have
heard
about
the
40
veterans
who
reportedly
died
at
one
Arizona
facility
alone
because
they
couldn&#8217;t
get
the
care
our
government
promised
them.
Similarly,
seven
hospitals
around
the
country
are
alleged
to
have
hidden
lists
of
veterans
waiting
for
treatment.
The
truth
is,
these
problems
at
the
VA
have
been
building
under
the
surface
for
some
time.
According
to
The
Washington
Times ,
&#8220;Veterans
Affairs
officials
warned
the
Obama-Biden
transition
team
in
the
weeks
after
the
2008
presidential
election
that
the
department
shouldn&#8217;t
trust
the
wait
times
that
its
facilities
were
reporting.&#8221;
This
is
a
glaring
contradiction
to
White
House
Press
Secretary
Jay
Carney&#8217;s
earlier
claim
that
the
president
first
learned
of
troubles
at
the
VA
through
the
media.
The
White
House
says
President
Obama
is
&#8220;madder
than
hell&#8221;
about
the
reports
of
negligence
at
the
VA.
Coming
from
a
military
family,
I&#8217;m
mad
too&#8212;we
all
should
be&#8212;but
it
will
take
more
than
anger
to
address
the
systemic
lack
of
accountability
at
the
VA.
It
requires
action.
Where
Obama
has
failed
to
act,
Congress
has
stood
in
the
gap.
In
July,
I
personally
wrote
VA
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki
to
call
attention
to
his
agency&#8217;s
inefficiency.
More
recently,
the
House
voted
with
my
support
to
create
a
task
force
charged
with
addressing
the
unacceptable
VA
claims
backlog
&#8212;
a
bill
that
is
still
awaiting
a
vote
in
the
Senate
despite
its
overwhelming
404-1
passage
in
our
chamber.
These
are
important
first
steps,
but
the
latest
instances
of
neglect
at
the
VA
show
that
more
needs
to
be
done.
To
that
end,
the
House
of
Representatives
acted
this
week
by
passing
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act
of
2014 ,
bipartisan
legislation
I
co-sponsored
allowing
the
VA
secretary
to
fire
underperforming
agency
executives
without
going
through
the
maze
of
bureaucratic
red

typically
required
to

an

appointee.
The
Senate
should
follow
the
House&#8217;s
lead
and
immediately
take
up
this
measure
so
that
our
veterans
are
protected.
Congress&#8217;
oversight
into
the
VA
is
ongoing,
and
we
are
prepared
to
take
our
efforts
all
the
way
up
the
chain
of
command
based
on

the

lead.
Our
veterans
have
fulfilled
their
commitment
to
our
country
in
ways
that
most
of
us
can
only
imagine.
It
is
our
job
in
Congress
to
