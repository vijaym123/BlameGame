Message from Dave
I know most of you are closely monitoring the situation with the wildfires in our state.
I know I am, and
I want to make sure that everyone has the resources necessary to take any critical precautions or help loved ones who may be affected by these terrible fires.

If you are interesting in volunteering to help victims, visit:

For other ways to assist those affected by the fires,
this article
in the Wenatchee World lists a variety ways.
My thoughts and prayers are with all of those affected, and please do not hesitate to
contact my offices
if we can be of assistance.
