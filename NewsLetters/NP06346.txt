Defending Our Nation
Wednesday evening, President Obama addressed the nation and outlined his strategy to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIS. This strategy includes increased airstrikes over Iraq and Syria, more training and support for Iraqi and Kurdish military forces, additional humanitarian aid to displaced civilians, and strengthened counterterrorism action plans.
Thursday morning, I joined Brian Thomas on 55KRC to discuss the Presidents plan to confront this savage enemy.

Curbing the EPA
Last week, I voted in support of H.R. 5078, the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act, that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers from expanding federal control under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to control all areas with a connection to navigable waters, such as ditches, ponds, and flood plains. This bill would eliminate the EPA's proposed rule and require federal agencies to consult with state and local officials regarding the scope of the CWA.
Southern Ohioans need relief from the tightening grip of the EPA. I have concerns that this land grab by the federal government will negatively impact farmers and businesses across Ohio by requiring them to comply with costly and time-consuming regulations. These regulations will come at a high cost and create uncertainty for businesses, farmers and commercial development.
H.R. 5078 now awaits further action in the Senate.
Remembering 9/11
13 years ago, Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda terrorists orchestrated a savage attack on our country that claimed 2,977 American lives. Still today, terrorists are claiming innocent lives all around the world.
These enemies of freedom revel in fear and long to see America and her torch of freedom extinguished. But in the words of President Bush: "We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail."
Never forget.
The Bergdahl Swap
This week, the House voted in favor of
H. Res. 644, a resolution condemning the Obama administrations failure to notify Congress before releasing five Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay in May.

Honoring Our Heroes
As your Representative to Congress, it is a tremendous privilege to present long overdue medals and awards to men and women who have worn the colors of this country with honor and distinction.
Yesterday, I presented several military honors to the families of four men who answered the call to serve during World War II and the Korean War: Specialist 5 Edward Harnishfeger, Lieutenant Commander Benjamin Pugh, Seaman Cordell Sherrill, and Technician 4 Stevie Shoemaker.
On behalf of a grateful nation and the Congress of the United States, I thank these men and their families for their selfless service to our country.
