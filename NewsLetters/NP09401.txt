HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM

Bill lowering cost of NMI Army Corps projects goes to the President - The House and Senate took final action this week on a bill that will significantly cut the local cost of some water infrastructure projects in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act
now goes to the President for approval. The bill, H.R. 3080 , contains a provision I added that will adjust the waiver of local cost sharing for Army Corps of Engineers projects in the islands from the current $200,000 to over $400,000. Or to put it another way, an Army Corps project will now be able to go forward in the Northern Marianas without the need for $400,000 in local funds. Past Corps projects include Rota Harbor improvements and the on-going Susupe-Chalan Kanoa drainage plan. In addition to the waiver increase, H.R. 3080 also provides eligibility for the Northern Marianas to receive assistance under a new levee safety initiative to protect shorelines and areas vulnerable to flooding. And the bill expands the existing Continuing Authorities Program , which is responsible for the Saipan Lagoon Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Study .

SGT Kelvin M. Cepeda, his wife Leimalyal Ogumoro-Uludong, and friend Dennis S. Camacho visited their congressional office in Washington this week. Kelvin and Lei traveled from his post in Fort Riley, Kansas to attend the commencement at the University of Maryland University College. SGT Cepeda used the Military Tuition Assistance Program and many off-duty hours to earn his bachelor's degree in criminal justice. Mr. Camacho hosted the couple at his home in Virginia. He serves as a firefighter with the Fairfax County Fire Department. Congratulations, SGT Cepeda, and thank you all for visiting.
Interior: No existing mineral leases in newly conveyed submerged lands - In addition to reminding the Secretary of the Interior of the responsibility to convey all rights to oil, gas, and other minerals in the submerged lands conveyed to the Commonwealth when the President signed Public Law 113-34 , I also requested in January a list of any existing leases for these resources on the conveyed lands. The Territorial Submerged Lands Act requires that rentals, royalties, or fees from such leases would now be payable to the Commonwealth. The Secretary and Governor Inos signed the conveyance of mineral rights in March; and this week I received a reply from Interior confirming that there are no existing leases or permits.
NDAA passes House, amendment for Air Force divert project included - The House approved the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 , including my amendment to expand the existing authorization for proposed Air Force divert airfield construction projects . Currently, the authorization is for Saipan. My amendment would permit expenditure of the funds on Tinian, as well, in the event that the Air Force and the Commonwealth agree that Tinian is the appropriate location for this development. The authorized $29.3 million would construct an aircraft parking apron, a maintenance facility, and a hazardous cargo pad. The Air Force is presently engaged in an environmental impact process to select between Tinian and Saipan for exercise activities and a back-up airfield in the event Andersen Air Force Base on Guam becomes unavailable. The House version of the $601 billion NDAA also approves a 1.8 percent pay increase for military personnel, includes important provisions related to sexual assault in the military, and authorizes funding for suicide prevention programs.

Mr. Alan Carrasco and Mr. Tatsuhiko Chubachi of DFS Saipan visited their congressional office this week and were given a staff-led tour of the U.S. Capitol. For information about things to do in Washington or to request tours, go to Sablan.house.gov .
Congressional leaders announce bill to improve workforce investment programs - House and Senate leaders have announced a bipartisan agreement on legislation to improve federal job training programs. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
is a compromise between S. 1356, the Senate's Workforce Investment Act reauthorization bill , and H.R. 803, the SKILLS Act passed by the House
in March 2013. The compromise authorizes 17 percent more funding for job training. It is also intended to consolidate programs and provide states and territories greater flexibility to tailor services to local needs. Disability advocates, who expressed concern about a proposal to move the Rehabilitation Services Administration from the Department of Education to the Department of Labor, won the day. RSA will remain at Education. A second area of concern, provision of a subminimum wage for the disabled, was not eliminated entirely, but the compromise bill halves the number of circumstances in which persons with disabilities can be paid less than the national minimum wage. The Senate is expected to take up the bill when it returns from the Memorial Day recess.
Farmers can get help with shipping costs - Farmers and ranchers in the Northern Mariana Islands can get help with the cost of sending their products to market off-island and with the cost of imported fertilizer, seed, and other production inputs through the Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program
of the Department of Agriculture. Congress reauthorized the program earlier this year in the 2014 farm bill; and Agriculture's Farm Service Agency announced this week that sign up begins July 21. The reimbursement program is designed for areas such as the Northern Mariana Islands where shipping costs are high. I encourage farmers and ranchers to enroll in the program. Be sure to save all transportation-related receipts as evidence of your expenses. For more information, contact Mr. Thomas Camacho, FSA County Director at (670) 236-0896 or email at thomas.camacho@pb.usda.gov .
