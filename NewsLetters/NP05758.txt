Update from Senator Bob Corker
October 5,
2014
Traveling Across Tennessee
Following a
thirteen-county swing across Tennessee in August, Senator Corker will continue
his visits across the Volunteer State this week with stops in Monroe,
Loudon and Union counties. Stay tuned for updates from the road in
next weeks e-newsletter.
Chattanooga Ironman
Senator Corker
enjoyed being downtown last Sunday as his hometown, Chattanooga, hosted its
first-ever Ironman race. The citys vibrant downtown and waterfront,
which were transformed under the senators leadership as mayor, served
as the perfect backdrop for Sunday nights finish. Congratulations to
this years winner, Matt Hanson (pictured below).

Chattanooga Times Free Press: For
Ironman Chattanooga's final finishers, even last was a
first
The biggest support was understandably for local firefighter
Jason Greer, who entered the Ironman to help raise money for Emily's
Power for a Cure and the Make-A-Wish Foundation as a tribute to his
cancer-stricken son Tristin, who's battling Stage 4 neuroblastoma. A
sluggish 320 pounds a year ago, Greer dropped more than 60 pounds training
for the triathlon. Approaching the finish line a few minutes after
midnight, he received a long, strong cheer before Tristin hung a race medal
around his father's neck. There really aren't words to describe what
that meant to me, said Greer, who was also at a loss for words when
U.S. Sen. Bob Corker hugged him a few minutes later and told him how
proud he was of him. It took me a minute to realize who he was, the
fireman said. I couldn't believe he knew
me.
Supporting Efforts to Contain Ebola
Outbreak
Senator Corker released the following
statement regarding the Pentagons announcement that soldiers from Fort
Campbells 101st Airborne Division will deploy to Liberia in late
October to support efforts to contain the outbreak of Ebola in West
Africa.
The Fort Campbell community has shown time and time again
that their unique capabilities remain essential to our national
security, said Corker. The U.S. has a vital role to play in leading the
global response to defeat this deadly outbreak, and I could not be more
proud of our men and women in uniform who are always willing to answer
the call to protect U.S. interests both at home and
abroad.
Federal health officials announced last week that the first case of
Ebola has been diagnosed in the United States.
