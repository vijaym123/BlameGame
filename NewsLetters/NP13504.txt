Dear Friend,
As you
may know, the first deadline for enrollment in the Affordable Care Act
is approaching.
You can continue to get insurance on the health
care exchange through the open enrollment period, which ends on March
31, 2014. However, this Monday, December 23 is the last day to sign
up for health care coverage beginning on January
1.
The delays and problems experienced by many
attempting to enroll in the exchanges are completely unacceptable, and I
support efforts to improve the law to ensure more Americans have access
to affordable health care.
But as you look for health care
coverage, there are many local resources to help guide you through the
process.
To view your options for
health coverage and find out whether or not you are eligible for a
federal contribution toward your health care costs, I would encourage you
to visit
www.getcoveredillinois.gov . If you
encounter problems or are in need of assistance, you can call the Illinois
healthcare hotline at (866) 311-1119, or visit
http://getcoveredillinois.gov/get-help/ to find specially trained
Navigators in your area who can help you find a plan that fits your
needs.
Under the Affordable Care Act,
Medicaid has been expanded to cover more families in Illinois.
You can find out if youre eligible by visiting
Get
Covered Illinois.
Get
Covered Illinois also has a list of frequently asked questions
here.
In the past
weeks, President Obama has announced additional options for individuals
who have struggled with the website or whose plans have been
canceled.
To find out what options are available, you should contact Get
Covered Illinois
here .
If you have trouble finding the resources you need, my
office is always here to help. Remember I am here to work for you. If you
have any questions, or concerns please feel free to
e-mail me , call our office, or connect with me on
Facebook and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Bill
Foster
Member of Congress
