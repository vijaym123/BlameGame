Dear Friend,
This week, I along with Central Florida
Veteran leaders received a briefing from the Veterans Administration
(VA) on the current status of the Baldwin Park VA Medical
Complex.
As we approach the completion of construction of the new
veterans hospital and medical complex at Lake Nona, I have been working to
keep the existing clinic at Baldwin Park in service to our
veterans.
This facility is a valuable federal asset that must not sit idle
once the new medical center opens.
I have
launched a renewed effort to keep this medical care facility open.
Two years ago in a communication to VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, I
requested that the VA develop plans to utilize both the clinic, nursing
home and domiciliary units at Baldwin Park after the Lake Nona complex
is operational. The VA has yet to take action.
To prompt the VA
to act, I have also initiated a joint letter from the entire Central
Florida Congressional Delegation to once again call on the VA to
respond.
Additionally, I have called on both veterans and
community leaders to demand action by the VA.
These men and women who
have faithfully served our nation deserve the very best medical care
and those beds that are now sitting idle must be put to the best
possible use.
The recently opened Lake Nona veterans 120-bed
nursing facility and 60-bed domiciliary care unit are already at capacity,
another indication that the vacant beds at Baldwin Park should not be
left unoccupied.
With a growing veteran population that is
already the second largest in the nation, including those service men and
women now returning from overseas conflicts, it is important that the
VA take steps now so that we can plan for their future medical
care.
Please know that I will continue to provide you with updates
as we move forward with this campaign to ensure that the Baldwin Park
clinic and medical facilities remain open and are put to use to the
benefit of our veterans.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
