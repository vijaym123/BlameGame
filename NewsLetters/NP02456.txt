Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Last week, Senator John McCain
and I reintroduced a resolution urging President Obama to posthumously
pardon John Arthur Jack Johnson for his unjust and racially-motivated
conviction more than a century ago.
In 1908, Jack Johnson
became the first African-American World Heavyweight Boxing Champion
after defeating Tommy Burns in Australia
a title Johnson held until
1915. Prompted by his success in the boxing ring and his relationship
with a Caucasian woman, Jack Johnson was wrongly convicted under the
Mann Act when he brought the woman he was dating across state lines. The
intent of the Mann Act was to prevent human trafficking of women for
the purpose of prostitution. However, a racially-motivated 1913
conviction imprisoned Jack Johnson for a year.
Johnson's unjust
conviction ruined his career and destroyed his reputation. Jack Johnson
was the greatest athlete of his time and a barrier-breaking boxer. He
deserves to be remembered for his incredible career, not for the
racism that unfairly sent him to prison. I am glad to work with my friend
Senator McCain to pardon Johnson, right a historical wrong and repair
the legacy of this great man. Now is the time to restore his
legacy.
