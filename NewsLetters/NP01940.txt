Thune Holds EPA Accountable on WOTUS Rule
VIDEO:
Sen. Thune criticizes the Obama
EPA's Waters of the U.S. proposed rule at a hearing before the Senate
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
Committee.
Today, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) sharply
criticized the Obama Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA)
controversial Waters of the U.S. rule at a hearing before the Senate Agriculture,
Nutrition, and Forestry Committee entitled, Waters of the United
States: Stakeholder Perspectives on the Impact of EPAs Proposed Rule.
Thune noted that the EPAs overreach has generated so much concern and
controversy that stakeholders have weighed in with over a million
comments to the proposed rule.
Witnesses from across the
country representing a diverse range of interests from production
agriculture and forestry, to rural electric cooperatives and county
governments shared common concerns about the proposed rule's ambiguity,
permitting requirements, and EPA enforcement of the rule. This rule would
grow the jurisdiction of the EPA to encompass nearly all ditches,
potholes, wetlands, and almost all other bodies of water in South Dakota
and other states.
