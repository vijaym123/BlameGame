Forbes Announces Job Fairs in Chesapeake and Chesterfield
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) announced today that he is hosting two job fairs in the Fourth District this summer. The job fairs, held in Chesterfield at Lloyd C. Bird High School and in Chesapeake at Greenbrier Middle School, are free and open to all constituents who are interested in learning about available jobs with area businesses.
A job is more than a means to a pay check, said Forbes. A job is hope for a future that is better than today. Its dignity. Its an opportunity to better your life and the life of your family. My hope is that the job fairs this summer will serve as a catalyst for employers and potential employees to form constructive working relationships and to learn about jobs and opportunities available in the Fourth Congressional District.
In addition to meeting with area businesses, attendees will have the opportunity to meet with experts on resume writing, interviewing, and job searching.
