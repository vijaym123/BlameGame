VISITING DC
January 09, 2015
This week is the beginning of the 114 th
Congress
with a new Republican majority and a new North Carolina Senator sworn
in. On Tuesday, Senator Tillis became the junior Senator from our
state and I greatly look forward to working with him in the coming
years.
I also have officially taken over as the Chairman of the
U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. As you may know, I've spent
the better part of two decades overseeing the work of our nation's
intelligence community as it has worked to keep us, and our allies, safe
at home and abroad. I am honored to assume this role and all of its
responsibilities. Under my leadership the Committee will conduct
vigorous oversight over the intelligence activities of our government -- it
is my job to ask the tough and probing questions and I intend to do
just that.
This week the world was shocked when Charlie Hebdo,
a satire magazine in Paris, France, was viciously attacked by
terrorists, killing 12 individuals. My thoughts and prayers are with the
victims and families affected by this attack.
Throughout our shared
histories, the citizens of France and of the United States have
consistently stood side by side to confront threats to our nations.
We
will continue to stand beside them as they confront this
challenge.
Since then, I have joined Wolf Blitzer, Bret Baier, and others
to discuss the actions of these terrorists and the international
implications. I will be joining Wolf Blitzer again tonight, Friday, January
9 th
during the 5pm hour and George Stephanopoulos on
Sunday morning, January 11 th .
On
Wednesday, Senator King and I reintroduced our legislation to reform
federal student loan repayment programs. The Repay Act, which Senator King
and I originally introduced last Congress, would simplify the complex
maze of federal student loan repayment programs by consolidating many
of the benefits of current repayment programs into two plans: a fixed
repayment plan, based on a 10-year period, and a single, simplified
income-driven repayment option.
Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.),
Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN)
have joined us this Congress as cosponsors.
North Carolinians
are tired of seeing their hard-earned tax dollars go to waste in a
student loan program that serves neither their interests nor those of the
college students it is intended to help. That is why Senator King and I
are reintroducing the Repay Act. The Repay Act has two very simple
goals: First, students should be presented with clear options on how to
repay their student loan debts affordably and in a straightforward
manner.
Second, taxpayers should no longer subsidize the excessive
borrowing and loan forgiveness that Washington has allowed to take
place over the past few years.
Although more can be done to address
the deficiencies in our student loan programs, the Repay Act is a
responsible step in the right direction toward better fiscal management
of our loan programs that allows students to make well-informed
decisions about borrowing for college.

Act, click

On the same day, I
joined Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN.), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory
Booker (D-NJ), Johnny Isakson (R-GA.), and Angus King (I- ME) in
introducing the FAST Act, a bill that would simplify the financial aid
process.
The bill would reduce to a single postcard -- called the
"Student Aid Short Form" -- the questions 20 million Americans must
answer to apply for federal financial aid each year and inform high school
students in their junior year of the amount they'll receive in federal
aid to help pay for college. It would also address the problem of
some students borrowing too much money, and simplify the options students
have to repay their federal loans.
The act also streamlines
federal grant and loan programs to better serve more students more
effectively.
The FAST Act dramatically simplifies the process for
answering the two biggest questions students face when going to school:
which college can I afford and how much assistance can I expect from
the federal government?
I am proud to lend my support to this
legislation, which will make the process for filling out the FAFSA form
a snap.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
