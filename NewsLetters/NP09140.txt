More Accountability Needed in Veterans Affairs Scandal
Earlier today, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki
announced his resignation in light of the growing VA scandal. His resignation is only part of the solution to the systemic problems within the VA
system. The issues uncovered at the VA are the result of severe mismanagement by officials at every level of the Department, as well as a total lack
of oversight from the White House, and are completely unacceptable. It is critical that the responsible officials and employees at the VA be held
accountable.
The
next VA Secretary will have a serious task before them to change the course of this troubled Department. I hope that a strong replacement is selected
to accomplish this task.
I also hope that President Obama will step up to the plate and lead on this issue as he has promised to do since his
election, including the signing of House passed legislation giving the VA Secretary increased authority to fire senior executive employees who fail to
serve our veterans. The delays in service faced by our veterans must be addressed immediately in order to correct the problem and ensure quality,
timely service for those who have sacrificed so much for our nation. Nothing less will be acceptable to the American public, or to
me.
It's the Administration's Job to Enforce the Law
For families across the nation, knowing that their communities are safe is a top priority. But, what happens
when the President and his officials refuse to enforce our laws and release criminals onto our streets?
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is tasked with keeping our nation
safe, but the current Administration&rsquo;s agenda of not enforcing our immigration laws flies in the face of this mission.
Just a few weeks ago,
Congress
learned
that more than 36,000 convicted criminal aliens
being processed for removal or already ordered removed &ndash; including hundreds of murderers, kidnappers, and rapists &ndash; were released into our
communities by the Obama Administration last year.
On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee held an oversight hearing on the DHS where Secretary Jeh Johnson testified in his
first appearance before the Committee.

Over the past five years, this Administration has made it clear that it will not
enforce our immigration laws. This has created a trust deficit with the American people and is effectively undermining Congress&rsquo; work to reform
our immigration laws. As we continue our work, the Department of Homeland Security should do its job by ensuring that criminals are detained and
deported, not released into our communities. We must hold DHS accountable for its actions and make sure it does everything possible to protect
citizens.
