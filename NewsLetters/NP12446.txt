Star Tribune: Bachmann backs bill that would limit Obama's power
Dear Friend,
As you know, last week was the President's annual State of the Union
address. What we heard that night was what we've come to expect from
President Obama every year-lofty speeches filled with political promises
that have little reality of ever coming true. The President and I do
agree-America faces grave challenges in 2014 and beyond. However, what
he sees as an excuse for growing the national debt and further
government involvement in Americans' lives, I believe is merely a
symptom of the larger problem of too much big government power and
overreach. For more on my response to the annual address, click here
.
Each Member of Congress is able to bring a guest to the speech. This
year I had the honor of bringing Dr. Julie Anderson, a family physician
from St. Cloud. Dr. Anderson wrote into my office last month outlining
her concerns about the impact of the President's health care law on her
private practice. And we had a great visit talking about how government
intrusion in healthcare is damaging the doctor-patient relationship.
Defense Against Cyber Attacks
Earlier this week I had the opportunity to question intelligence
community officials
on the security
of the Obamacare website from foreign attacks during a hearing on
Worldwide Threats before the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence.
According to news accounts
, U.S. intelligence agencies warned in
a report to the Department of Health and Human Services of a possible
cybersecurity attack by Belarus via malware on the Obamacare website.
When pressed on this during the hearing, the heads of these agencies all
denied knowing
about the report and its subsequent withdrawal.
This means that millions of Americans who put their personal information
on the Obamacare website believing that it would be secure could be
vulnerable to a cyber-attack. That's why I've called for the Obamacare
website to be taken down until the proper tests have been done to
guarantee that Americans' personal data are not at risk.

bill
that

Dear
Friend,
As
you
know,
last
week
was
the
President&#8217;s
annual
State
of
the
Union
address.
What
we
heard
that
night
was
what
we&#8217;ve
come
to
expect
from
President
Obama
every
year&#8212;lofty
speeches
filled
with
political
promises
that
have
little
reality
of
ever
coming
true.
The
President
and
I
do
agree&#8212;America
faces
grave
challenges
in
2014
and
beyond.
However,
what
he
sees
as
an
excuse
for
growing
the
national
debt
and
further
government
involvement
in
Americans&#8217;
lives,
I
believe
is
merely
a
symptom
of
the
larger
problem
of
too
much
big
government
power
and
overreach.

Each

I
had
the
honor
of

Dr.
Julie

a

St.

Dr.

of

And
we

a
great

talking
about
how
government
intrusion
in
healthcare
is
damaging
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
Defense
Against
Cyber
Attacks
Earlier
this
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
intelligence
community
officials
on
the
security
of
the
Obamacare
website
from
foreign
attacks
during
a
hearing
on
Worldwide
Threats
before
the
House
Permanent
Select
Committee
on
Intelligence.
According
to
news
accounts ,
U.S.
intelligence
agencies
warned
in
a

to
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
of
a
possible
cybersecurity
attack
by
Belarus
via
malware
on
the

When
pressed
on
this
during
the
hearing,
the
heads
of
these

all
denied

the

and
its

This
means
that
millions
of
Americans
who
put
their
personal
information
on
the
Obamacare
website
believing
that
it
would
be
secure
could
be
vulnerable
to
a
cyber-attack.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
called
for
the
Obamacare

to
be
taken
down
until
the
proper
tests
have
been
done
to
guarantee
that

not
at
risk.
