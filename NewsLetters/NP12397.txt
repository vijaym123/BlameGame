Serrano Applauds BronxWorks
Helps with $1
Million Federal Grant
Today, Congressman Jos E.
Serrano applauded BronxWorks, an organization in his community that
changes lives and assists those in need with a variety of services.
Serrano recently helped BronxWorks with a federal grant from the Department
of Housing and Urban Development for their work, which will bring $1
million to the organization.
BronxWorks is precisely the
type of organization that our federal government must support, said
Congressman Serrano. The good work done in our community cannot be
replaced and its impact cannot be understated. They are a keystone in the
network of non-governmental organizations providing services to the
homeless and underserved populations in the Bronx. I was extremely proud
to be able to help them with their HUD grant, which, being worth $1
million, is of great importance to the organization, and by extension,
our community. I salute BronxWorks for all they are doing in our
borough, and look forward to working with them to help people in need for
years to come.
BronxWorks has reduced street homelessness
in the borough by 72% since 2005.
HUD funding has been critical
to this achievement, said Eileen Torres, interim Executive Director of
BronxWorks. HUD supports our Living Room homeless drop-in center, a
24 hour, seven day a week facility where homeless individuals can
spend the night, use the laundry and showers, eat meals, and receive
medical treatment and other services.
The Living Room is an important
component in our comprehensive services to help people transition
from life on the streets to permanent housing.
The
accomplishments of BronxWorks in 2012 alone illustrate the vast array of
services that they offer that change lives in the Bronx.
