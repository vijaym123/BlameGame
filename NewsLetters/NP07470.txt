This week, we are scheduled to vote on a resolution by Speaker John Boehner allowing the House of Representatives to initiate a lawsuit against the President. I take issues like this very seriously, and I want to know where you stand on this issue.
The lawsuit comes after multiple delays of provisions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
I voted against the ACA because I didnt think it was the right approach to overhauling our nations health care system, and Im leading the effort to fully repeal the very provisions that the President has failed to enforce.
But now the Speaker of the House wants to sue the President for delaying parts of this law.
Will you please share your thoughts with me by taking part in our quick poll below? Your responses are very important to me.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
