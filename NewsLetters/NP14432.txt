Veterans Day
Dear Neighbor,
America is the land of the free and home of the brave. Men and women in our armed forces have been paying a high price for this freedom and on this Veterans Day
as with every other day of the year - we remember their courage and sacrifice with the deepest gratitude.
As the son of a World War II Navy Veteran, and a brother of three Veterans, I have a personal attachment to America's servicemen and women. I will continue to fight for our Veterans and do all that I can to ensure that they receive the benefits that they deserve.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
