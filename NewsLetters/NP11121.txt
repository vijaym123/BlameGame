Dear Friends,
More than 5 million Americans now have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Are you one of them?
With only a few days left to sign up, I want to make sure you know about all the resources available to you.
CoveredCA continues to be a great option for those who wish to sign up for coverage online or over the phone. Their
&ldquo;Find Help Near You&rdquo;
tool can also help you find an enrollment center with representatives who will walk you through the application process.
In addition, several organizations are hosting upcoming enrollment events. Some of those events are listed below.
