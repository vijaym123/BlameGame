Friends,
Today is a somber day in our countrys history; a day that will truly
live in infamy.
At
7:48 am on December 7, 1941, two waves of Japanese fighter planes and
naval vessels bombed our countrys deep-water naval base at Pearl Harbor
on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
This ruthless surprise attack
lasted just two hours but killed more than 2,000 American soldiers, 68
civilians, and wounded hundreds more.
The Japanese destroyed and
damaged more than 20 ships of the United States Pacific Fleet and more
than 100 airplanes, temporarily immobilizing our countrys naval
taskforce.
While the attack we suffered at Pearl Harbor was
devastating, our resilient nation stood united.
On December 8, 1941,
President Franklin Roosevelt delivered his Infamy Speech to a joint
session of Congress.
After denouncing the Pearl Harbor attack,
President Roosevelt urged the House of Representatives and the Senate to pass
a resolution declaring war against the Imperial Government of Japan.
Congress obliged in record time and 33 minutes later, with only
one dissenting vote, the United States of America officially entered
World War II.
We will never
forget the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Americans who lost their lives;
and today, we are reminded of the sacrifices our troops continue to
make to protect our nation.
Ensuring that our military has the
tools and training it needs to be successful is one of the most important
roles of Congress, which is why I voted in favor of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 last week.
With growing global threats from terrorist
groups like ISIL and radical foreign leaders, Congress must make
military funding a priority.
The bill my colleagues and I passed on
Thursday guarantees that our military has the resources it needs to
keep us safe.
Furthermore, this legislation prevents the transfer
of any National Guard Apache Helicopters in fiscal year 2015, ensuring
that the South Carolina Apache fleet remains in our state for another
year.
I will continue to support our troops and their efforts
abroad to defeat terrorism and promote
democracy.
It is an honor and privilege to serve you and
your family.
Have a good
week,
