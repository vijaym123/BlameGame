Dear
Friends,
This afternoon, Congressman Nunnelee
moved from TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, Texas to The Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. His speech and left side mobility
continue to improve. He will continue speech and mobility rehabilitation
and begin chemotherapy and radiation treatment this
week.
The Congressman and his family continue to
send their appreciation for your prayers, well-wishes, and
support.
Please continue to let us know if
our office can be of assistance.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth C.
Parks
Elizabeth C.
