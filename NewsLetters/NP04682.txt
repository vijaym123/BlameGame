Tuesday was a tough night. But today, we have some good news to share: There were 14 races too-close-to-call on Election Night:
But as of 1pm today:
Democrats have won
7 Republicans have won
0
It&rsquo;s another reminder of how your record-breaking grassroots support made the difference. In the ten closest races, your donations and volunteer hours allowed us to reach out to key voters over
641,000
times. 641,000 Door Knocks and Phone Calls
And the margin in those 10 races -- combined? 14,635 votes Your grassroots support literally made the difference between victory and defeat in these races. We can&rsquo;t say thank you enough for all you've done.
Now, we just need to make sure every single vote is counted fairly and accurately in our final 7 too-close-to-call races.
