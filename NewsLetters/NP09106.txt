Dear Friends:
I hope you had a wonderful Memorial Day to kick off the summer.
Its always a great time of year to see folks getting outside, to thank the men and women of our military for everything they do for us, and, mostly importantly, to remember those whove made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
I had the chance to visit with troops stationed in Afghanistan as part of a bipartisan Congressional delegation (CODEL) led by my colleagues, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann and Congressman Patrick Murphy.
With so many troops making their way home over the next year, we wanted to thank them personally for everything they've done for our country, and reassure them of our commitment that theyll be taken care of when they get home.

Next week the House will not be in session, and so I'm conducting a District Work Period.
Ill be traveling around the district visiting with folks. In particular, I'll be meeting with veterans groups and employers from across the district to discuss ways we can work together to make sure the men and women who serve this country are given every opportunity here at home.
Im also hosting two Congress on the Corner town hall meetings in the district on Saturday, May 31st.
