Dear
David,
I wanted to bring your attention to
an aggressive phone scam that is making its way throughout the country
involving impostors posing as IRS tax collection representatives.
Dont be fooled by this scam.
The IRS will
never contact you over the phone without having sent something in the
mail first. Do not give any personal information over the phone and be
careful with these threatening phone calls. Take a moment to read up
below on tips to spot a scam, and consider forwarding this email to a
friend or neighbor who might benefit from this information.
