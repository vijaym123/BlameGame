Dear Friends,
Join me at an upcoming Town Hall Meeting!
Town halls are
a great opportunity for me to meet you and hear your views about the
critical issues facing our nation. Whether you want to voice your
concerns about public lands, the budget or national security, your views
are very important to me. I'm holding town hall meetings next week in
Hurricane and Cedar City. I hope to see you
there!
