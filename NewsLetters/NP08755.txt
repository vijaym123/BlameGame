Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. It is an honor
to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you this update on
our activities in the Second District and Washington, D.C.
WRRDA Signed Into Law
I'm glad to see the President signed the Water Resources Reform &
Development Act Tuesday-the first new water bill in 7 years. I am
extremely proud to have worked on this piece of bipartisan legislation
that strengthens our national economy and positively impacts Oklahomans.
Oklahomans in DC
I'm always impressed by the number of Oklahomans that visit Washington,
D.C. each week. I know it's not an easy trip to make, but I do believe
it is an important one. And I'm glad that my office can play a small
part in making that journey a little easier and a little more
enjoyable.
If you're interested in visiting Washington, be sure to contact our
office at 202-225-2701!
Great to have a several groups of Oklahomans in Washington this week
Hearing on Overreaching EPA Rule
On Wednesday, Oklahoma Water Resources Board (OWRB) Executive Director
J.D. Strong testified at a hearing of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment about
the potential impacts of a proposed Clean Water Act rule by
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps of Engineers).
This proposed rule could result in rural ponds, watering holes,
runoffs, drainage ditches and potholes to fall under the jurisdiction
of the Clean Waters Act, impeding or prohibiting many agricultural
practices.
In the first part of the two panel hearing, I had the opportunity to
question EPA and Corps of Engineers officials about the process by
which the rule was developed and how the rule may affect rural farmers
and business owners.
As part of the second panel, Director J.D. Strong testified on the
significance of the EPA rule and unanimous consistent among Western
States that state agencies were not consulted in the development of the
rule.
The heartbeat of this country, being our farming community, in my
opinion is being threatened here.
For this reason, I will continue to
fight against this burdensome rule and for the rights of Oklahoman
farmers, ranchers and small business owners.
Volunteer Day of Service
Today, Christie and I, along with several members of my district team,
spent some time at the Muskogee Salvation Army sorting donated food.
It was a humbling and rewarding experience to see the generosity of the
Second District up close.
I also enjoyed the opportunity to speak with
Lt. Jason Sebo and other disaster team members about their operation.
Week Ahead
We've kicked-off a busy month and a half in Washington. Next week I
will be back for legislative business. You'll be able to find updates
on votes and other business on my website and social media pages.

Hearing
on
Overreaching
EPA
Rule
On
Wednesday,
Oklahoma
Water
Resources
Board
(OWRB)
Executive
Director
J.D.
Strong testified
at
a
hearing
of
the
House
Transportation
and
Infrastructure
Subcommittee
on
Water
Resources
and
Environment
about
the
potential
impacts
of
a
proposed
Clean
Water
Act
rule
by
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
and
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
(Corps
of
Engineers).
This
proposed
rule
could
result
in
rural
ponds,
watering
holes,
runoffs,
drainage
ditches
and
potholes
to
fall
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Clean
Waters
Act,
impeding
or
prohibiting
many
agricultural
practices.
In
the
first
part
of
the
two
panel
hearing,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
EPA
and
Corps
of
Engineers
officials
about
the
process
by
which
the
rule
was
developed
and
how
the
rule
may
affect
rural
farmers
and
business
owners.
As
part
of
the
second
panel,
Director
J.D.
Strong
testified
on
the
significance
of
the
EPA
rule
and
unanimous
consistent
among
Western
States
that
state
agencies
were
not
consulted
in
the
development
of
the
rule.
The
heartbeat
of
this
country,
being
our
farming
community,
in
my
opinion
is
being
threatened
here.
For
this
reason,
I
will
continue
to
fight
against
this
burdensome
rule
and
for
the
rights
of
Oklahoman
farmers,
ranchers
and
small
business
owners.
