A MESSAGE FROM
CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER
The 2015 tax season is
underway and I would like to share with you some useful information as
you prepare your tax returns. The following resources could help
save you both time and money when filing your state and federal
taxes:
The IRS offers
free online tax filing
software:
"FreeFile" . The Free File
software can help taxpayers with tax preparation, including tax
provisions relating to the health care law.
The IRS also
offers two free programs that provide in-person counseling on
tax-related issues: Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling
for the Elderly (TCE). VITA is a service provided to
anyone
earning less than $53,000 a year . TCE is a service for people
age 60 or above . Click
here
for
additional information and for VITA or TCE locations near
you.
Tax information for students:
the IRS
partnered with education professionals to bring students the
Understanding Taxes site , an interactive tax education
program for high school and community college
classrooms.
Keep up with the status of your refund by
visiting
Wheres My Refund? , an online tool that allows
you to track when your refunds will
arrive.
Visit
IRS.gov
to find a variety of
additional resources that may help answer many of your tax filing
questions.
I hope that these resources are helpful to you
and your family as you file your 2014 tax returns. If you have
