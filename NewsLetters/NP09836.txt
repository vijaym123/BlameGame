Dear Friend,
This month the House of Representatives started working through our
annual spending bills to fund various aspects of the government. I am
pleased to share that my bipartisan amendment to aid the investigation
of the Phoenix Veterans Hospital debacle was adopted unanimously in the
bill that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs. More information on
my efforts on behalf of Arizona veterans is available below.
Continuing my pursuit to rein in excessive and duplicative spending, I
introduced legislation to target duplicative and unnecessary government
spending. Click here
to see my latest Shrink Our Spending (SOS) legislation.
Additionally, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius
announced her resignation in April. With increasing premiums and
arbitrary changes to the healthcare law, it is time we repeal and
replace this law with patient-centered reform. That is why I wanted to
remind you about healthcare reform that I support
.
I hope you and your family have a Happy Mother's Day.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of
service and be sure to sign up for my newsletter here
.
It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Updates from Washington, D.C.
Phoenix Veterans Hospital Update
Our veterans have already sacrificed so much for our country, and we
cannot let another day pass without ensuring that these men and women
are treated as the heroes they are, rather than a burden to
unaccountable bureaucrats. That is why I jointly introduced an
amendment to the Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations
bill to ensure proper resources are available to investigate this
debacle. This amendment passed the House of Representatives and now
goes to the Senate. Click here

to watch my floor speech on why this legislation is needed.
Shrink Our Spending (SOS) Initiative Update
I came back to Washington fully committed to make tough choices, cut
spending and balance our budget. My SOS Initiative continues to bring
us one step closer to balancing our budget and establishing a sense of
fiscal sanity in Washington. This month, I tackled the EPA's Science
and Technology Account and the National Labor Relations Board-both
groups with separately duplicative roles. Click here

on my website linked here

Senator Lee and Rep. Salmon Reform Head Start
I teamed up with Senator Mike Lee to introduce bicameral legislation to
reform our federal Head Start Program. Even with the best intentions,
the federal government has a history of botching programs with a
one-size-fits-all approach, and education is no different. Our
legislation will give parents, school districts, and states the
flexibility needed to make sure that these funds best reflect their
will for pre-K programs, with no federal strings attached. When parents
and states are given greater flexibility in education, children win.

Western Hemisphere Hearing on Transnational Drug Smuggling and FY 2015
Foreign Affairs Budget
As Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I convened
two hearings this month. The first was with Chairman Duncan Hunter
(CA-50) of the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation, where we explored ways our government can move toward a
more cohesive and effective multi-agency strategy to protect our
national security interests related to transnational drug smuggling.
Additionally, we held a hearing on the FY 2015 Foreign Affairs Budget
focused on how - in tightened budgets - our strategy and policy in the
Western Hemisphere must reflect our vital national interests.
More Customs Officers Coming to Arizona
I led a bipartisan letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security
requesting additional customs officers come to Arizona. We were
successful in securing 170 agents to join our already stretched
resources at ports of entry. This highlights the good we can accomplish
as our delegation looks for ways to come together to improve our state.
We will continue to fight for more resources for Arizona. Read more

Dear
Friend,
This
month
the
House
of
Representatives
started
working
through
our
annual
spending
bills
to
fund
various
aspects
of
the
government.
I
am
pleased
to
share
that
my
bipartisan
amendment
to
aid
the
investigation
of
the
Phoenix
Veterans
Hospital
debacle
was
adopted
unanimously
in
the
bill
that
funds
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
More
information
on
my
efforts
on
behalf
of
Arizona
veterans
is
available
below.
Continuing
my
pursuit
to
rein
in
excessive
and
duplicative
spending,
I
introduced
legislation
to
target
duplicative
and
unnecessary
government
spending.
Click

to
see
my
latest
Shrink
Our
Spending
(SOS)
legislation.
Additionally,
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
Kathleen
Sebelius
announced
her
resignation
in
April.
With
increasing
premiums
and
arbitrary
changes
to
the
healthcare
law,
it
is
time
we
repeal
and
replace
this
law
with
patient-centered
reform.
That
is
why
I
wanted
to
remind
you
about
healthcare
reform
that
I
support .
I
hope
you
and
your
family have
a
Happy
Mother's
Day.
As
always,
please
do
not

Update
Our
veterans
have
already
sacrificed
so
much

and
we
cannot
let
another
day
pass
without
ensuring
that
these
men
and

are
treated
as
the
heroes
they
are,
rather
than
a
burden
to
unaccountable

That
is
why
I
jointly
introduced
an
amendment
to
the
Military
Construction/Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
bill
to
ensure
proper

are
available
to
investigate

to
reform
our
federal
Head

Even
with
the
best

the
federal
government
has
a
history
of
botching
programs
with
a
one-size-fits-all
approach,
and
education
is
no
different.
Our
legislation
will
give
parents,
school
districts,
and
states
the
flexibility
needed
to
make
sure
that
these
funds
best
reflect
their
will
for
pre-K
programs,
with
no
federal
strings
attached.
When
parents
and
states
are
given
greater
flexibility
in
education,
children
win.
