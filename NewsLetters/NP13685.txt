Dear friend,
This week,
I voted against a budget plan to raise taxes and increase government
spending by $63 billion over the next two years.
The budget
plan
which passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate
was sold to the American people as cutting the deficit by $23 billion
over the next 10 years.
But if you look at the fine print, what
it does is make promises of future spending cuts in exchange for actual
spending increases today.
Those spending increases
gut the hard-won spending cuts Republicans fought for during the debt
ceiling battle of 2011, otherwise known as the sequester.
The
sequester
which ended up generating bipartisan support, and was
signed into law by President Obama
forced necessary and long-overdue
cuts in discretionary spending.
And while it wasnt perfect, it
was a big step forward in the fight to get our $17 trillion debt under
control.
The sequester, however, was never going to be the
final answer.
After all, the biggest drivers of our debt arent
discretionary programs, but entitlement programs, like Medicare and
Social Security.
Thats why Republicans made a promise to the
American people that we would use the sequester to fight for real
entitlement reform.
This week, I advocated for keeping that
promise.
I told my colleagues
both Republican and Democrat
that we had a historic opportunity to find common ground in order to
save Medicare and Social Security.
But they decided to go in a
different direction.
They decided to kick the can down the road
while making empty promises to the American people.
To me, that
didnt make any sense.
I continue to believe that
cutting spending and reducing the debt are vital components to bolstering
our economy and preserving the American Dream.
Since Republicans
took control of the House in 2011
and made fiscal responsibility one
of our top priorities
government spending has shrunk by the largest
amount in decades and the deficit has been cut in half.
Meanwhile, the economy has grown at a faster rate and the unemployment
rate has fallen.
This is in sharp contrast to the doomsayers who
claimed that cutting spending would weaken our economy.
In
truth, the opposite has happened.
The deal that passed the House
this week was a bad one, plain and simple.
We could have done
better, and we should have done better.
But the fight for fiscal
sanity will continue.
And I pledge to keep being a leader in
that fight.
