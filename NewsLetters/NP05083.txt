Kansas Common Sense
October 27, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Ebola Conference Call with CDC Director, Kansas Health Care Providers
and State Officials
On Thursday afternoon, I hosted a conference call on Ebola with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Tom
Frieden and Kansas health care providers and state officials to discuss
Ebola response efforts. This call was also a good opportunity for me to
learn how I may be of assistance to providers across our state to
prepare for Ebola and other infectious disease responses. I appreciate
the questions and insight from Kansas health care providers who
participated in the call, and their commitment to making sure our
public health infrastructure is prepared to handle Ebola. Secretary of
the Kansas Department of Health and Environment Dr. Robert Moser and
Adjutant General of Kansas Major General Lee Tafanelli were among the
many health care and emergency response officials from across the state
who called in to hear from Dr. Frieden and other key CDC officials on
this important issue. Thanks to all who participated.
As we fight Ebola in Africa, we need to make certain we are protected
at home as well. I urge the Administration to implement travel
restrictions on commercial airline passengers traveling from nations
afflicted by Ebola. While Americans were assured that our public health
infrastructure was ready to handle Ebola, unfortunately reality has
shown we still have a lot of work to do. Travel restrictions will also
give us time to make certain our hospitals are procedurally ready to
handle Ebola patients.
Agent Orange Awareness Month
Many veterans and their families are still struggling with side effects
from their exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Agent
Orange, as well as other toxins, force veterans to endure a wide range
of symptoms and medical ailments - many of which are misdiagnosed due
to lack of understanding and substantiating scientific proof. These
toxins not only afflict our nation's veterans, they also often create
health complications in their children and grandchildren.
October is Agent Orange Awareness Month and it provides an opportunity
to highlight a topic that impacts a large number of veterans and their
families in Kansas and across the country. A few months ago, I
introduced the Toxic Exposure and Research Act with Democratic Senator
Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. The legislation would provide for
research on the health conditions of descendants of veterans who were
exposed to toxins during their service to our nation. It would also
establish a national center at a VA medical facility for the research,
an advisory board to offer recommendations to the VA Secretary and
declassify certain incidents of exposure of Armed Forces Members to
toxic substances, and create a national outreach campaign to promote
further awareness. My hope is this legislation helps to establish
medical evidence of toxic exposure symptoms in order to properly
diagnose and treat those family members who live with these health
complications. Click here
to learn more.
USDA to Implement Crop Insurance Provision
I was pleased to learn this week that USDA will implement the Actual
Production History (APH) Yield Exclusion for Spring 2015 crops, a
provision included in the 2014 Farm Bill designed to provide relief for
farmers suffering from severe drought. Originally, USDA did not intend
to implement the provision before 2016. Many Kansas farmers have seen
significant decreases in their insurable yields due to failed or very
low-yielding crops during the drought. This provision will ensure crop
insurance remains a viable risk management tool for our farmers by
allowing them to exclude certain low yields from their APH due to
drought.
The APH Yield Exclusion was one of a number of vital improvements made
to crop insurance in the 2014 Farm Bill. For example, farmers are now
able to purchase separate Enterprise Units on irrigated and dryland
crops. Moreover, farmers will also be allowed to purchase different
coverage levels on irrigated and dryland crops. My disappointment is
that these provisions will not be ready in time for our winter wheat
producers; instead they will be available for crops planted next
Spring. I continue to urge USDA to find ways to make these positive
crop insurance improvements available for winter wheat producers this
year.
Protecting American Businesses from Retroactive Tax Increases
On Tuesday, I joined Senator Pat Roberts and a bipartisan group of 13
Senators in writing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew regarding recent
proposals to repeal the accounting method of "last-in, first-out,"
known as LIFO. As Congress considers ways to reform our tax code, some
have suggested eliminating the LIFO provision, but our letter to
Secretary Lew expresses concerns that such a repeal would create undue
burden for many American businesses and run counter to the goal of a
simple and efficient tax code. I look forward to Secretary's Lew's
response to our letter. To view a signed copy, click here
.
Domestic Violence Awareness Month
October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Domestic violence is a
horrific problem that so many individuals and families endure and
demands our attention. In Kansas, an estimated one in 10 adult women
will suffer from domestic abuse this year. Men and children are
victims, as well. Whether we realize it or not, statistics prove that
all of us know someone who is suffering physical and psychological
abuse. We should continue to draw attention to these crimes and
encourage anyone who needs help to seek it. Before the Senate
adjourned, I spoke about this topic on the Senate floor. You can watch
a video of my speech by clicking here
.
Kansas Listening Tour Stops Continue
On Monday, I hosted a Kansas Listening Tour Stop at Ray's Pharmacy in
Quinter. Area residents and I discussed a number of issues including
the need for effective coordination to stop Ebola, the Lesser Prairie
Chicken, the importance of a Farm Bill, the convoluted tax code and the
Affordable Care Act. I appreciated Quinter High School Teacher Mrs.
Kelli Getz bringing her senior government class to participate, as well
as the students' thoughtful questions. Thanks to Ray's Pharmacy owner
Jack Tebow for hosting the town hall meeting. For a full listing of my
upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops, visit my website
.
Visiting Fort Hays State University
On Monday, I had a great visit on the Fort Hays State University
(FHSU) Campus with President Dr. Mirta Martin. Robba was on the
selection committee, and we both want to assist FHSU for the benefit of
students and our state.
Kanorado Community Visit
I also visited to the community of Kanorado on Monday. There weren't
many people around as corn harvest is in full swing. According to the
folks I did visit with, farmers have quite a ways to go before it's
completed. I also stopped by Don's Service Station, the Post Office and
City Hall. As far as I could tell, I was the only person in town
wearing a tie.
Now Accepting Spring 2015 Internship Applications
I am now accepting applications for paid congressional internships in
my Washington, D.C., and Kansas offices for spring 2015. An internship
in my office - either legislative or communications - provides a unique
opportunity to work closely with Senate staff on behalf of the state of
Kansas. Legislative interns will gain a better understanding of the
legislative process in the U.S. Congress, and develop knowledge and
professional skills valuable to future career pursuits. Communications
internships offer an intern the chance to learn about how political
communications and the legislative process intersect, and gain
practical knowledge about the inner workings of a fast-paced press
office.
The application deadline for spring 2015 is November 1, 2014.
Applications may be obtained and completed under the "Services" section
of my website at www.moran.senate.gov
. Applicants should submit a completed application form, resume,
academic transcript, two letters of recommendation, and a cover letter
explaining their interest in public service and addressing a policy
issue of personal importance and a suggested recommendation to resolve
that issue. Please submit required materials to:
internships@moran.senate.gov.
Cheering on the K-State Wildcats
This weekend, I enjoyed cheering on the Kansas State University
Wildcats Football Team in a win over the Texas Longhorns at Bill Snyder
Family Stadium in Manhattan. With the victory, the Wildcats are now 6-1
and first in the Big 12. Thanks to K-State President Kirk Schulz, his
wife Noelle and the university for their hospitality. It was great
visiting with a number of Kansas including the Dreiling Family who I'm
pictured with here.

in

Ebola
Conference
Call
with
CDC
Director,
Kansas
Health
Care
Providers
and
State
Officials
On
Thursday
afternoon,
I
hosted
a
conference
call
on
Ebola
with
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
Director
Dr.
Tom
Frieden
and
Kansas
health
care
providers
and
state
officials
to
discuss
Ebola
response
efforts.
This
call
was
also
a
good
opportunity
for
me
to
learn
how
I
may
be
of
assistance
to
providers
across
our
state
to
prepare
for
Ebola
and
other
infectious
disease
responses.
I
appreciate
the
questions
and
insight
from
Kansas
health
care
providers
who
participated
in
the
call,
and
their
commitment
to
making
sure
our
public
health
infrastructure
is
prepared
to
handle
Ebola.
Secretary
of
the
Kansas
Department
of
Health
and
Environment
Dr.
Robert
Moser
and
Adjutant
General
of
Kansas
Major
General
Lee
Tafanelli
were
among
the
many
health
care
and
emergency
response
officials
from
across
the
state
who
called
in
to
hear
from
Dr.
Frieden
and
other
key
CDC
officials
on
this
important
issue.
Thanks
to
all
who
participated.
As
we
fight
Ebola
in
Africa,
we
need
to
make
certain
we
are
protected
at
home
as
well.
I
urge
the
Administration
to
implement
travel
restrictions
on
commercial
airline
passengers
traveling
from
nations
afflicted
by
Ebola.
While
Americans
were
assured
that
our
public
health
infrastructure
was
ready
to
handle
Ebola,
unfortunately
reality
has
shown
we
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do.
Travel
restrictions
will
also
give
us
time
to
make
certain
our
hospitals
are
procedurally
ready
to
handle
Ebola
patients.
Agent
Orange
Awareness
Month
Many
veterans
and
their
families
are
still
struggling
with
side
effects
from
their
exposure
to
Agent
Orange
during
the
Vietnam
War.
Agent
Orange,
as
well
as
other
toxins,
force
veterans
to
endure
a
wide
range
of
symptoms
and
medical
ailments
&ndash;
many
of
which
are
misdiagnosed
due
to
lack
of
understanding
and
substantiating
scientific
proof.
These
toxins
not
only
afflict
our
nation's
veterans,
they
also
often
create
health
complications
in
their
children
and
grandchildren.
October
is
Agent
Orange
Awareness
Month
and
it
provides
an
opportunity
to
highlight
a
topic
that
impacts
a
large
number
of
veterans
and
their
families
in
Kansas
and
across
the
country.
A
few
months
ago,
I
introduced
the
Toxic
Exposure
and
Research
Act
with
Democratic
Senator
Richard
Blumenthal
of
Connecticut.
The
legislation
would
provide
for
research
on
the
health
conditions
of
descendants
of
veterans
who
were
exposed
to
toxins
during
their
service
to
our
nation.
It
would
also
establish
a
national
center
at
a
VA
medical
facility
for
the
research,
an
advisory
board
to
offer
recommendations
to
the
VA
Secretary
and
declassify
certain
incidents
of
exposure
of
Armed
Forces
Members
to
toxic
substances,
and
create
a
national
outreach
campaign
to
promote
further
awareness.
My
hope
is
this
legislation
helps
to
establish
medical
evidence
of
toxic
exposure
symptoms
in
order
to
properly
diagnose
and
treat
those
family
members
who
live
with
these
health
complications.

USDA
to
Implement
Crop
Insurance
Provision
I
was
pleased
to
learn
this
week
that
USDA
will
implement
the
Actual
Production
History
(APH)
Yield
Exclusion
for
Spring
2015
crops,
a
provision
included
in
the
2014
Farm
Bill
designed
to
provide
relief
for
farmers
suffering
from
severe
drought.
Originally,
USDA
did
not
intend
to
implement
the
provision
before
2016.
Many
Kansas
farmers
have
seen
significant
decreases
in
their
insurable
yields
due
to
failed
or
very
low-yielding
crops
during
the
drought.
This
provision
will
ensure
crop
insurance
remains
a
viable
risk
management
tool
for
our
farmers
by
allowing
them
to
exclude
certain
low
yields
from
their
APH
due
to
drought.
The
APH
Yield
Exclusion
was
one
of
a
number
of
vital
improvements
made
to
crop
insurance
in
the
2014
Farm
Bill.
For
example,
farmers
are
now
able
to
purchase
separate
Enterprise
Units
on
irrigated
and
dryland
crops.
Moreover,
farmers
will
also
be
allowed
to
purchase
different
coverage
levels
on
irrigated
and
dryland
crops.
My
disappointment
is
that
these
provisions
will
not
be
ready
in
time
for
our
winter
wheat
producers;
instead
they
will
be
available
for
crops
planted
next
Spring.
I
continue
to
urge
USDA
to
find
ways
to
make
these
positive
crop
insurance
improvements
available
for
winter
wheat
producers
this
year.
Protecting
American
Businesses
from
Retroactive
Tax
Increases
On
Tuesday,
I
joined
Senator
Pat
Roberts
and
a
bipartisan
group
of
13
Senators
in
writing
Treasury
Secretary
Jack
Lew
regarding
recent
proposals
to
repeal
the
accounting
method
of
"last-in,
first-out,"
known
as
LIFO.
As
Congress
considers
ways
to
reform
our
tax
code,
some
have
suggested
eliminating
the
LIFO
provision,
but
our
letter
to
Secretary
Lew
expresses
concerns
that
such
a
repeal
would
create
undue
burden
for
many
American
businesses
and
run
counter
to
the
goal
of
a
simple
and
efficient
tax
code.
I
look
forward
to
Secretary's
Lew's
response
to
our
letter.

Domestic
Violence
Awareness
Month
October
is
Domestic
Violence
Awareness
Month.
Domestic
violence
is
a
horrific
problem
that
so
many
individuals
and
families
endure
and
demands
our
attention.
In
Kansas,
an
estimated
one
in
10
adult
women
will
suffer
from
domestic
abuse
this
year.
Men
and
children
are
victims,
as
well.
Whether
we
realize
it
or
not,
statistics
prove
that
all
of
us
know
someone
who
is
suffering
physical
and
psychological
abuse.
We
should
continue
to
draw
attention
to
these
crimes
and
encourage
anyone
who
needs
help
to
seek
it.
Before
the
Senate
adjourned,
I
spoke
about
this
topic
on
the
Senate
floor.

Kansas
Listening
Tour
Stops
Continue
On
Monday,
I
hosted
a
Kansas
Listening
Tour
Stop
at
Ray's
Pharmacy
in
Quinter.
Area
residents
and
I
discussed
a
number
of
issues
including
the
need
for
effective
coordination
to
stop
Ebola,
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken,
the
importance
of
a
Farm

Act.
I
appreciated
Quinter
High
School
Teacher
Mrs.
Kelli
Getz
bringing
her
senior
government
class
to
participate,
as
well
as
the
students'

Visiting
Fort
Hays
State
University
On
Monday,
I
had
a
great
visit
on
the
Fort
Hays
State
University
(FHSU)
Campus
with
President
Dr.
Mirta
Martin.
Robba
was

and
our
state.
Kanorado
Community
Visit
I
also
visited
to
the
community
of
Kanorado
on
Monday.
There
weren't
many
people
around
as
corn
harvest
is
in
full
swing.
According
to
the
folks
I
did
visit
with,
farmers
have
quite
a
ways
to
go
before
it's
completed.
I
also
stopped
by
Don's
Service
Station,
the
Post
Office
and
City
Hall.
As
far
as
I
could
tell,
I
was
the
only
person
in
town
wearing
a
tie.
