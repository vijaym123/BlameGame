Congressman Cook Remembers Our Veterans
On Monday, November 11, we will celebrate Veterans Day.
For me, this
is a day to pay tribute to my fellow veterans who have risked life and
limb protecting our freedoms.
All service men and women, both past and
present, have honored the call to duty and selflessly put the welfare
of our nation before their own personal needs. Last week, I had the
privilege of taking to the floor of the United States House of
Representatives to honor the sacrifice of our veterans. As the Veterans
Day weekend begins, please join me in keeping the brave members of our
military and their families in your thoughts and prayers as they
continue to serve our nation.
