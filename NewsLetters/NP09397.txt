Dear Friend,
As we celebrate Memorial Day, we reflect upon and honor the brave men
and women in uniform who have sacrificed their lives to protect our way
of life.
We owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude and I join with
all Rhode Islanders in remembering these extraordinary heroes on this
day.
We also should always be thankful for the outstanding men and
women currently serving in our armed forces, and their families, for
their service and sacrifice.
Today I will join with Rhode Islanders at parades in Bristol and North
Providence, and participate in the official state ceremony at the Rhode
Island Veterans Memorial Cemetery to pay tribute to the heroes who made
the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our liberty and remember their
valor and sacrifice.
It is also an important occasion to reaffirm our
obligations to our brave men and women in uniform who are today
safeguarding our national interests all over the world. While they have
never asked for anything in return for their service, they deserve to
know that we will uphold our promise and responsibility to them to meet
their needs when they return home.
On this Memorial Day, let us also honor America's real heroes, remember
their sacrifice and renew our commitment to uphold the values and
ideals for which they made the ultimate sacrifice.
Each year, Memorial Day is a solemn occasion, but is also an
opportunity to spend time with friends and family and marks the
beginning of our great Rhode Island summer,
I wish you and your
family a pleasant and meaningful day.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov
My best always,
David Cicilline

a
tremendous
debt

I
join
with
all
Rhode

these
extraordinary

on
this
day.
We
also
should
always
be
thankful
for
the

While
they

they
deserve
to
know
that
we

them
to
meet
their
needs
when
they
return
home.
On
