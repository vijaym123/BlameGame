Burying the Death Tax
Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015. The Death Tax, aptly named, is a 40 percent tax on certain individuals transfer of assets to the next generation at the time of his or her death. Though originally coined as the Estate Tax, this law has disproportionately affected small businesses and family-run farms. After hearing the story of Hitchcock Farms during the April District work period, I was further encouraged to support the repeal of this legislation. Burying the Death Tax ensures that families will not be taxed into shutting down their farming operations.
While I was touring local farms with the Washington County Farm Bureau, I visited Hitchcock Farms,
a 5 th generation diversified row crop and cattle operation located in Tennille, GA. Waylan Hitchcock has been in farming since the early 1970s, starting his career right after high school, and was thrilled to have his sons join the family business in 2010. Since then, Hitchcock Farms has grown from a 500-acre farm to nearly 2,250 acres of crop and pasture land and 300 heads of cattle.
While I was in the District, the family vocalized their fear of losing their family farm due to the Death Tax. I am proud to fight for hardworking families who want to pass on opportunities to their children. Repealing this damaging legislation is a great step towards getting Washington out of the way of greater economic opportunity.
The fight for a fairer tax code is one that I am dedicated to, and I look forward to supporting future legislation that will benefit families like the Hitchcocks and families across the Tenth District.
