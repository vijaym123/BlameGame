In addition to suspensions, on Monday, the House passed
H.R. 1872 , the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act, by
a vote of 230-165.
H.R. 1872 increases the transparency of
federal budgeting by bringing off-budget entities on-budget, reforms
the accounting methodology used for federal credit programs to reflect
best practices from the private sector, and requires agencies to
promptly make public the budget justification materials they submit to
Congress in support of their requests for public funds.
It also
commissions two studies in furtherance of the Budget Committees ongoing
review of potential improvements to the congressional budget
process.
On Tuesday,
the House passed
H.R.
1871 , the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 by a
vote of 230-185.
H.R. 1871 removes the inflationary assumptions
and special exceptions from the discretionary baseline
requiring
that the baseline assume neither an increase nor a decrease for these
programs. In addition, the bill codifies the Congressional Budget
Offices (CBO) current practice of providing a long-term economic and budget
outlook no later than July 1 of each year.
Tuesday afternoon, I, along with Representatives Peter Welch
(VT-AL), Chellie Pingree (ME-1), and Cory Gardner (CO-4), introduced the
Protecting the Sustainable Use of Spent Grains Act.
This
bipartisan bill prevents the FDA from interjecting itself into the
long-standing relationship between breweries and farmers by regulating spent
grain.
In October 2013, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a rule that would subject
breweries that sell or donate spent grains
a high-protein byproduct
of the brewing process
to local farmers to onerous new requirements,
driving up costs, and leaving these breweries with no choice but to
dispose of spent grains in landfills.
The FDAs
proposed rule is a solution in search of a problem.
The last thing
breweries and farmers across the country need is the federal government
interjecting itself into the environmentally sound, centuries-old
practice of breweries selling or donating their spent grains to farmers
for use as food for animals, especially when there is no indication that
this practice poses any sort of risk to our food supply.
The
federal government should be praising this type of collaboration, not
burdening it with onerous new regulatory requirements that drive up
costs and discourage sustainable disposal practices.
With this bill,
common-sense prevails, and our breweries, farmers, and environment
will be better off because of it.
On Wednesday, the Appropriations Committee had its first markup of
the fiscal year 2015 appropriations season, and both the fiscal year
2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations
(MilCon-VA) bill and the fiscal year 2015 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill
were approved.
The MilCon-VA bill contains funding to train and equip our
troops, provide housing and services to military personnel and their
families, help maintain base infrastructure, and fund veterans benefits
and programs.
The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill provides
annual funding for the offices of members of the House of
Representatives, the support agencies of Congress (including security), services
for visitors, and Capitol operations and maintenance.
These bills
now head to the House floor for
consideration.
Wednesday afternoon, I met with the Fort Smith
Chamber of Commerce and enjoyed showing them around the Capitol.
Fort
Smith is a dynamic city, and I am grateful for the chambers
leadership and dedication to making the city even
better.
Wednesday evening, I attended the Armed Forces
Foundation Gala, where I met Justin Moore - a fellow Arkansan and
Razorbacks fan - and saw my friend, Kurt Busch! Thanks to Patricia
Driscoll and the foundation for all you do to support and assist the men and
women of our armed services and their families in their greatest
times of need.
On Thursday,
April 10, the House passed
H.Con.Res.96 , the Path to
Prosperity fiscal year 2015 budget, by a vote of 219-205.
H.Con.Res. 96 establishes the budget for fiscal year 2015 and budget levels
for fiscal years 2016 through 2024.
The budget achieves balance
by 2024, reducing total spending by $5.1 trillion over the next ten
years.
The House Budget rejects the President's requested cuts to
national security; strengthens the safety net; repeals Obamacare and
preserves Medicare and Social Security for future generations;
strengthens American energy security by scaling back corporate subsidies and
restoring competition in the energy sector; and reforms the overall
budget process.
Its easy to support
spending cuts in principle, and this budget puts our money where our
mouth is and provides a real path forward
a Path to Prosperity
that
addresses the true drivers of our deficits and debt, because we cannot
keep spending money that we dont have.
Its irresponsible, and
its unsustainable.
The House
will not be in session the week of April 14th or the week of April
21st.
The House will reconvene the week of April
28th.
