Dear Neighbor,
Recently, we visited WCA Hospital&rsquo;s new patient-centered, private SAFE Suite. The Safe Suite at WCA Hospital was created to protect and help sexual assault victims and ensures that victims of sexual assault receive the specialized care they need to recover from the trauma of sexual assault.
The SAFE suite provides the victims of traumatic sexual assault a safe place to recover and receive the proper medical care they need. Advocating against sexual assault needs to be everyone&rsquo;s priority; it&rsquo;s all of our jobs to stand up for what&rsquo;s right.
Earlier in the year, we co-sponsored the
Campus Accountability and Safety Act , which strengthens accountability and transparency for colleges and universities, sets stiff penalties for a school&rsquo;s non-compliance, requires training for on-campus personnel and gives students access to confidential advisors to use as a resource.
With staff at WCA Hospital and healthcare professionals.
Today we met with a great group entrepreneurs at Sterling Innovations Group in Corning. It's spirit like this that will drive our economic recovery and new jobs!
P.S -- From our family to yours, have a very safe and happy Halloween!
P.P.S -- we attended the 41 st
Annual Steuben County RSVP Volunteer recognition even in Corning, and recognized the good work of our local neighbors do.
Best, Tom
