Dear Friends,
Last
weekthe news broke that ISIS targeted another group of innocent victims
based off their faith identity. ISIS claimed the lives of 30 innocent
Christian from Ethiopia who were in Libya at the
time.
My wife Kay and I continue to pray for Africa
and especially Ethiopia as they mourn their
loss.
This senseless act only magnifies the fact that the
United States has a responsibility to lead in protecting religious
minorities around the world.
That
is why in February of 2015, I introduced
the bi-partisan
Religious Freedom Resolution (S.Res.69). This legislation fights to protect
religious minority rights and freedoms around the
world.
The resolution also condemns the reign of
terror brought by ISIS who has sought to destroy any person of faith
that does not embrace their radical interpretation of Islam. ISIS has
led the destruction of Jonahs tomb in Mosul, the destruction of
Sunni shrines and mosques in Ninevah, the destruction of Christian
churches in Syria and the slaughter of anyone who resists their teachings.
This resolution would put the United States on the record that such
heinous acts are not acceptable.
A copy of the resolution can be read by
clicking here .
In an age where terror groups are seeking to
violently oppress religious group and target America, what should we
do as a nation to stop these groups? Increase sanctions on the countries where these
terrorist groups are located Use military action to thwart violent actions by these
groups Provide support to countries
in the region who share similar religious freedom
values The United States should not be
involved Other If you are
having trouble, click here.
Thank
you for taking the time to read this newsletter and fill out the
survey.
Sincerely,
Office
