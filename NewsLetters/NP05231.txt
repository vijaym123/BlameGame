 to enable me to know what the federal government needs to provide the city.
Last week, Dallas health care worker Nina Pham was transferred to our Bethesda National Institutes of Health campus.
That alerted me to the need for more specialized hospitals equipped to deal with Ebola outbreaks.
Nationally, there are only 19 beds in four specialized hospitals combined.
I note that two more specialized units are being built in Kansas and Boston.
Nevertheless, every hospital needs guidance on how to handle walk-ins.
The District is a high-travel capital, and Dulles is one of the first five airports scheduled to require screening of passengers from West Africa.
Fighting Changes That Slow First-Class Deliveries and Affect the Safety of U.S. Postal Workers
On Wednesday, I sent a letter
to Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe that asks him to reconsider the consolidation of more than 80 mail-processing centers in January 2015 that will delay First-Class and other mail delivery, without public input.
I cited a recent United States Postal Service Inspector General report that found that the decision should have included comment from the public, as required by law.
I asked Postmaster Donahoe to reconsider his decision to ensure the safety of USPS workers and to maintain the current timeframe for First-Class deliveries.
Urging Low-Wage Workers to Engage Congress on Inequality
On Thursday, I spoke at a rally
that included union workers, low-wage workers, and organizations that advocate for livable wages to urge them to engage Congress on policy changes that would end wage inequality.
At the rally, leadership from these organizations, as well as regional elected officials, directed their requests for a wage hike to the Walton family, who, as owners of Wal-Mart, are leaders among corporations that pay wages so low that many of their workers have to rely on government subsidies, such as food stamps.

Surveying D.C. Hospitals on Ebola Preparedness, Seeking More Regional Treatment Facilities Nationwide
On Friday, after a few new potential Ebola cases surfaced on U.S. soil, I asked D.C. hospitals
specific questions
to enable me to know what the federal government needs to provide the city.
Last week, Dallas health care worker Nina Pham was transferred to our Bethesda National Institutes of Health campus.
That alerted me to the need for more specialized hospitals equipped
