Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
On Monday, we will pause as a nation to remember those brave men and
women in uniform who have given the "last full measure of devotion"
while serving our country.
On Thursday, I joined members of the freshman class from the 113th
Congress to lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery in honor of
Memorial Day.
During the visit, I was able to pay respects to a number of graves in
the cemetery's Section 60, which contains graves for veterans who have
perished in our recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Included
among these were the gravestones for the Navy SEALs and U.S. Army
operators who perished on August 6, 2011 in Afghanistan when their
Chinook helicopter - call sign Extortion 17 - was shot down by enemy
fire.
This Monday, please remember these men and say a prayer for their loved
ones.
While we give thanks to our fallen heroes, it is a sad fact that our
government has failed to take adequate care of the heroes who are still
with us. The mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
is a national disgrace.
Those who have provided faithful service to our country in the armed
forces deserve timely and quality care. It is becoming clearer all the
time that the VA is failing the nation's veterans.
The failures
include preventable deaths, patient safety incidents, and backlog
increases.
Dozens of VA facilities are even being investigated for
falsifying data and creating secret waiting lists while veterans have
been left to suffer.
As a Navy veteran, I am proud of the veterans who reside in our
district and throughout the state of Florida, and serving veterans is
one of my top priorities.
I am pleased to report that this week the
House voted to restore accountability by passing H.R. 4301, the VA
Management Accountability Act, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote.
This legislation would give the Secretary of the VA the necessary
authority to hold poorly-performing VA managers accountable for their
failures.
If senior officials are not adequately performing their jobs, and
letting our veterans down in the process, then they need to be removed
from their positions. Those who have put their lives on the line in
defense of our freedom deserve better than this.
The VA is a big, cumbersome bureaucracy and without robust
accountability I fear it will continue to deliver substandard services
to millions of our veterans.
Also, this week the House Foreign Affairs committee conducted a hearing
about the African-based terrorist group Boko Haram.
During the
testimony, I was stunned to see a State Department official hedge on
whether the group is motivated by a desire to wage Islamic jihad
against "infidels" such as Christians and Jews.
You can watch my line of questioning by clicking here
.
The facts are clear: the group recently kidnapped roughly 250 (mostly
Christian) schoolgirls from Chibok, Nigeria. Boko Haram forced the
girls to don Islamic dress and recite verses from the Koran. They plan
to sell the girls as brides to Islamic men.
Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau's recent speech provided with stark
clarity the motivation of the group. Shekau said the attack is part of
a "Jihad war against Christians and Christianity. It is a war against
western education, democracy and constitution. Allah said we should
finish them when we get them."
In his speech, Shekau cited his Islamic faith in support of abolishing
religious freedom, slaughtering Christians and Jews, selling girls into
slavery, raping girls as young as 9 years old, and assassinating the
President of the United States.
It is dangerous for policy makers to blind themselves to reality.
We
must be willing to look evil in the face and call thee by they name.
I hope that you are able to spend time with your family and friends
this Memorial Day weekend!

Dear
Friend&#8211;
On
Monday,
we
will
pause
as
a
nation
to
remember
those
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
have
given
the
"last
full
measure
of
devotion"
while
serving
our
country.
On
Thursday,
I
joined
members
of
the
freshman
class
from
the
113th
Congress
to
lay
a
wreath
at
Arlington
National
Cemetery
in
honor
of
Memorial
Day.
During
the
visit,
I
was
able
to
pay
respects
to
a
number
of
graves
in
the
cemetery&#8217;s
Section
60,
which
contains
graves
for
veterans
who
have
perished
in
our
recent
conflicts
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq.
Included
among
these
were
the
gravestones
for
the
Navy
SEALs
and
U.S.
Army
operators
who
perished
on
August
6,
2011
in
Afghanistan
when
their
Chinook
helicopter
&#8211;
call
sign
Extortion
17
&#8211;
was
shot
down
by
enemy
fire.
This
Monday,
please
remember
these
men
and
say
a
prayer
for
their
loved
ones.
While
we
give
thanks
to
our
fallen
heroes,
it
is
a
sad
fact
that
our
government
has
failed
to
take
adequate
care
of
the
heroes
who
are
still
with
us.
The
mismanagement
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
is
a
national
disgrace.
Those
who
have
provided
faithful
service
to
our
country
in
the
armed
forces
deserve
timely
and
quality
care.
It
is
becoming
clearer
all
the
time
that
the
VA
is
failing
the
nation&#8217;s
veterans.
The
failures
include
preventable
deaths,
patient
safety
incidents,
and
backlog
increases.
Dozens
of
VA
facilities
are
even
being
investigated
for
falsifying
data
and
creating
secret
waiting
lists
while
veterans
have
been
left
to
suffer.
As
a
Navy
veteran,
I
am
proud
of
the
veterans
who
reside
in
our
district
and
throughout
the
state
of
Florida,
and
serving
veterans
is
one
of
my
top
priorities.
I
am
pleased
to
report
that
this
week
the
House
voted
to
restore
accountability
by
passing
H.R.
4301,
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act,
in
an
overwhelmingly
bipartisan
vote.
This
legislation
would
give
the
Secretary
of
the
VA
the
necessary
authority
to
hold
poorly-performing
VA
managers
accountable
for
their
failures.
If
senior
officials
are
not
adequately
performing
their
jobs,
and
letting
our
veterans
down
in
the
process,
then
they
need
to
be
removed
from
their
positions.
Those
who
have
put
their
lives
on
the
line
in
defense
of
our
freedom
deserve
better
than
this.
The
VA
is
a
big,
cumbersome
bureaucracy
and
without
robust
accountability
I
fear
it
will
continue
to
deliver
substandard
services
to
millions
of
our
veterans.
Also,
this
week
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
committee
conducted
a
hearing
about
the
African-based
terrorist
group
Boko
Haram.
During
the
testimony,
I
was
stunned
to
see
a
State
Department
official
hedge
on
whether
the
group
is
motivated
by
a
desire
to
wage
Islamic
jihad
against
"infidels"
such
as
Christians
and
Jews.
You
can
watch
my
line
of
questioning
by
clicking
here .
The
facts
are
clear:
the
group
recently
kidnapped
roughly
250
(mostly
Christian)
schoolgirls
from
Chibok,
Nigeria.
Boko
Haram
forced
the
girls
to
don
Islamic
dress
and
recite
verses
from
the
Koran.
They
plan
to
sell
the
girls
as
brides
to
Islamic
men.
Boko
Haram
leader
Abubakr
Shekau&#8217;s
recent
speech
provided
with
stark
clarity
the
motivation
of
the
group.
Shekau
said
the
attack
is
part
of
a
&#8220;Jihad
war
against
Christians
and
Christianity.
It
is
a
war
against
western
education,
democracy
and
constitution&#8230;
Allah
said
we
should
finish
them
when
we
get
them.&#8221;
In
his
speech,
Shekau
cited
his
Islamic
faith
in
support
of
abolishing
religious
freedom,
slaughtering
Christians
and
Jews,
selling
girls
into
slavery,
raping
girls
as
young
as
9
years
old,
and
assassinating
the
President
of
the
United
States.
It
is
dangerous
for
policy
makers
to
blind
themselves
to
reality.
We
must
be
willing
to
look
evil
in
the
face
and
call
thee
by
they
name.
I
hope
that
you
are
able
to
spend
time
with
your
family
and
friends
this
Memorial
Day
weekend!
