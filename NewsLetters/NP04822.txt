I hope you and your family have a safe and fun Halloween tonight.
In
light of the occasion, I want to highlight the scary truth: Washington
red tape is killing our economy.
Click on the video short below from
the House Committee on Financial Services to see more.
Spoiler alert:
You will notice some familiar scary characters as stars!
It was a privilege to speak at Archbold Medical Center's dedication of
the North Tower
on Monday.
The new
wing brings many upgrades and improvements including a new emergency
department and trauma center, improved ICU, and expanded facilities.
Already the largest employer in the Thomasville area with 2,600
Southwest Georgians on staff, the hospital continued its commitment to
the community through the North Tower's construction- even the boilers
and structural steel were fabricated in Thomas County!
I have always been proud to call Georgia home, and I am prouder still
to represent the Eighth Congressional District in Congress that is home
to so many great health care facilities, like the Archbold Medical
Center.
Please visit my facebook page
to join me in
thanking Archbold for their commitment to the health of Southwest
Georgia!
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress
