LEGISLATION
Dear
David,
July 4
Freedom is never more than one generation away
from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream.
It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the
same. - Ronald Reagan
This July 4th, have fun, be safe, and enjoy the freedoms we as
Americans are so lucky to have. Americans have fought, and continue to fight,
for those freedoms. Today is a day of enjoyment, but let it also be a
day of remembrance of how the United States and its people achieved
greatness. And, we can still continue to achieve that greatness by
relying upon the natural resources of this abundant land.
Blessed with some of the largest supplies globally of coal, natural gas, and
oil, we can jumpstart our economy and get Americans back to
work.
Lowering prices for gas,
home heating &amp; cooling, and
groceries
In Iraq, militants are taking over
various portions of the country, and
have seized
Iraqs main oil refinery.
Now, more than ever, it is important
we cultivate domestic energy resources
renewable, and nonrenewable.
Despite this, energy production on land owned by the federal
government has continued to wane.

More energy production will
contribute to lower heating or cooling costs for your home or apartment, and
more affordable prices for gas and groceries. The economy is still
recovering, and Americans across the country need their day-to-day
purchases to be more affordable. An all-of-the-above energy strategy that
embraces both traditional, nonrenewable energy sources as well as
innovative, renewable energy is best for the United States. Energy projects
like the Keystone XL pipeline can play a role in achieving these goals
with the added benefit of creating jobs. I talk about the Keystone XL
pipeline in more detail on my blog.
Enjoy your Independence Day, and know that I understand
the squeeze middle working class Americans face. I will continue to
fight for the issues that matter most to you.
I always enjoy hearing from my constituents. If
