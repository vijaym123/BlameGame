Dear Friend,
The FEC&rsquo;s Pre-General deadline is tonight at midnight. We have to be at $8O,OOO by then -- and right now, we&rsquo;re $4,275 short.
If we miss this goal, we can&rsquo;t run the GOTV effort we want.
Give $5 if you can. Give $10. Give $20 if that makes sense for you. Every last dollar counts and will be put to good use by our field team.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
The pollster Stuart Rothenberg was among the first to ring the alarm bells that Democrats are in trouble. In a recent post, Rothenberg says that even with polls tightening, he still &ldquo;[doesn&rsquo;t] like where many Democratic Senate nominees are now positioned.&rdquo;
But Rothenberg has acknowledged that Democrats can change the electoral math if we can put up strong turnout numbers. And
all those efforts depend on your grassroots support. Our $8O,OOO goal will help finance our operations through the final weeks of the campaign. We can&rsquo;t afford to slip up now -- give $5 before midnight tonight.
Thank you for all of your efforts so far,
Ed
