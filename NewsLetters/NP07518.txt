VISITING DC
July 25, 2014
This week, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the
ABLE Act -- a piece of commonsense, bipartisan legislation introduced
by Senator Casey and me.
Put simply, the ABLE Act would allow
families with a severely disabled child the opportunity to save their
own money in a 529 college savings account to help cover their childs
long-term expenses.
Over three-quarters of the Congress has added
their names to the ABLE Act as cosponsors, including both the
Majority and Minority leaders in the Senate.
If you have
the time, I encourage you to watch this hearing, as it includes
inspiring testimony from disabled individuals and their families, including
one woman, Sara Wolff, who has Down Syndrome but who currently works two
jobs.
She supports the ABLE Act so that she can save for her
own future.
Another one of the witnesses at the hearing was a
fellow North Carolinian, Robert D'Amelio.
Mr. DAmelio shared his
familys story
two of his sons have Autism
and how the ABLE Act
would greatly improve his sons prospects and give him peace of mind that
his boys will be cared for in the future.
You can watch the
full hearing
here , my opening statement
here , and my question and answer session with Mr.
DAmelio
here .
Senator Casey and I have been
working together to perfect this bill for 8 years, and its time has
come.
Lets pass the ABLE Act, and lets do it
now.
Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on
Robert McDonalds nomination to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
During the hearing, Mr. McDonald heard what our
expectations will be if he becomes VA Secretary.
I shared several key
expectations: that he embrace the findings of the recent
investigations into the VA, urgently work to bring about needed reforms, and that
he usher in a new culture throughout VA.

Mr. McDonald also had a chance to share his own hopes
and his ideas of how to address the deeply systemic problems at
VA.
You can read his opening statement in full
here .
At the end of the hearing, each member of the
committee was able to question Mr. McDonald.
The full line of questions
and answers between Mr. McDonald and myself can be watched
here .
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on
Veterans Affairs unanimously voted to send the Mr. McDonald to the Senate
floor for confirmation.
I am pleased that Mr. McDonalds
nomination moved quickly through the committee and it is my expectation he
will swiftly receive Senate confirmation.
His private sector
experience and his apparent will to make the drastic changes needed within
the Department bolsters my confidence.
Much must be done and I
look forward to working with him to make sure that VA lives up to its
mission.
The Senate will vote on his nomination next
week.
Finally, I am happy to announce that I will be co-hosting both
the
Defense Trade Show
in Fayetteville, NC on
August 5, 2014 and the
North Carolina Aerospace Supplier
and Advanced Manufacturing (ASAM) Summit
in Winston-Salem, NC on

Sincerely,
Richard Burr
