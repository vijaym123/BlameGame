Last month, the U.S. produced more oil than
it imported for the first in nearly two decades due to production on
state-owned and private-owned land only. On Wednesday I voted on H.R.
1965, Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act, which would set new
permitting standards aimed at increasing our onshore oil and gas
production on federal-owned land. Do you support boosting onshore oil and gas production on
federal lands as a way in move America towards energy
independence? Yes No I have no opinion.
