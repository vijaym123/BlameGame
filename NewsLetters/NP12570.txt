Dear David,
As you know, hunting, fishing, and the sportsman way of life are
central to Arkansas's identity.
I grew up on a farm and spent my
childhood hunting and fishing with my dad.
When I'm at home in
Dardanelle, I often go for runs on Mt. Nebo, one of Arkansas's many
state parks.
These are some of the things I missed the most about home
while I was deployed in the Army.
That's why I was proud to sponsor the Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement Act, which passed the House earlier today.
This legislation had bipartisan support and will help protect the
traditional right of sportsmen to fish and hunt.
Specifically, the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act
rolls back onerous Federal regulations on public lands, increasing
access for fishermen and hunters.
It also prevents future efforts by
the government to arbitrarily implement new regulations that would
block access to these areas.
And it allows sportsmen to purchase
Federal duck stamps on the internet-increasing access and lowering
costs.
This bill also protects and supports 2nd amendment rights by
guaranteeing the right to bear arms on any lands owned by both National
Park and National Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers.
And it prohibits the EPA from regulating traditional ammunition and
fishing tackle, which protects jobs and keeps hunting affordable for
Arkansas's sportsmen.
I will continue to fight for Arkansas's sportsmen.
I hope the Senate
will consider this legislation quickly.
As always, please do not
hesitate to contact me
if you have any questions or concerns, or simply want to
express your opinion.
I'm always happy to hear from you.
Sincerely,

Dear
David,
As
you
know,
hunting,
fishing,
and
the sportsman
way
of
life
are
central
to
Arkansas&#8217;s
identity.
I
grew
up
on
a
farm
and
spent
my
childhood
hunting
and
fishing
with
my
dad.
When
I&#8217;m
at
home
in
Dardanelle,
I
often
go
for
runs
on
Mt.
Nebo,
one
of
Arkansas&#8217;s
many state
parks.
These
are
some
of
the
things
I
missed
the
most
about
home
while
I
was
deployed
in
the
Army.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
proud
to
sponsor
the
Sportsmen&#8217;s
Heritage
and
Recreational
Enhancement
Act ,
which
passed
the
House
earlier
today.
This
legislation
had
bipartisan

and
will
help
protect
the
traditional
right
of
sportsmen
to

hunt.
Specifically,
the
Sportsmen&#8217;s
Heritage
and
Recreational

Act
rolls
back
onerous
Federal

on
public

increasing

It
also
prevents
future
efforts
by
the

to
arbitrarily

new
regulations
that
would
block

to
these

And
it

And
it
