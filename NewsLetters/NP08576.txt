Rubio, Booker Introduce Legislation
To Expand Unlicensed Spectrum Use
On Thursday, Marco and Senator Cory
Booker (D-NJ) introduced S. 2505, the
Wi-Fi
Innovation Act , legislation to expand
unlicensed spectrum use by requiring the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
to test the feasibility of opening the
upper 5 GHz band to unlicensed use.
At a time when demand for spectrum is
drastically increasing, the legislation
aims to provide more of this valuable
resource to the public to bolster
innovation, spur economic development,
and increase connectivity.
In a century defined by
drastic and colossal technological
advancement, it is hard going even a
day without using our cell phones,
tablets and other wireless
devices,
said Rubio . Access to
mobile broadband enhances our daily
lives, facilitating quality work and
timely communication. But our wireless
devices rely on spectrum, a valuable
and limited resource.
To meet the demands of our
time, action must be taken to ensure
spectrum is utilized effectively and
efficiently,
added Rubio . This bill
requires the FCC to conduct testing
that would provide more spectrum to the
public and ultimately put the resource
to better use, while recognizing the
future needs and important work being
done in intelligent transportation. I
am pleased that Senator Booker has
joined me in this effort to foster the
innovation and economic growth needed
to make this century another American
century.
Rubio On The Situation In Iraq: We
Must Learn The Lessons Of History,
Obama Must Lead
Throughout the week, Marco discussed
the situation in Iraq and the threat that
terrorist advances in the country have on
American lives. He addressed the issue in
a Senate floor speech. An excerpt of the
speech is below.
Rubio: Never again can we
allow an Al Qaeda-style group to
establish a safe haven where they can
plot against us anywhere on this
planet. And the choice before you, Mr.
President, is you either deal with it
now or some future president and future
Congresses and future Americans will
deal with it later.
Watch his entire Senate floor speech
here .
Marco also discussed the situation in
Iraq with FOX News
Sean
Hannity
and in an interview on
610
WIOD Miami Radio .
Rubio Named To House-Senate
Conference Committee On VA Reform
Bill
On Wednesday, Marco welcomed the
announcement that he has been named to
the House-Senate conference committee,
which will now reconcile different
versions of Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) reform legislation that each
congressional chamber recently
passed.
Although he is not a member of the
Senate Committee on Veterans
Affairs, Marco was asked to be part of
the conference committee due to his
leadership in sponsoring the
VA
Management Accountability Act of
2014 , which passed the House in May
and was included in the Senate-passed VA
reform legislation earlier this month.
This measure would give the VA secretary
the authority to fire or demote VA Senior
Executive Service (SES) or equivalent
employees based on performance.
The VA is in desperate need
of reform and accountability, and I
look forward to being part of this
effort to resolve outstanding policy
differences and produce a final law
that starts making a real difference
for our veterans,
said Rubio . Our veterans
have been wronged by the abuses,
incompetence, and inhumane and
unresponsive health care that have come
to light in the recent wave of VA
scandals.
The legislation were
working on includes many important
first steps we can take to honor our
veterans with the care they need, and I
hope we can get something done
quickly,
added Rubio . I look
forward to being a voice at the
negotiating table for Floridas 2
million veterans, as well as all
veterans across the country.
