We know, David. We ask a lot.
(Ok, a ton).
There&rsquo;s a good reason why:
-- In 2012, Bob Dold and outside groups spent more than $8,000,000 against us.
-- In 2014, they&rsquo;re on pace to spend even more to beat up on Brad&rsquo;s progressive record.
But the most important reason is simple: -- If we don&rsquo;t have the resources to respond, we could lose.
That might sound grim, but it&rsquo;s the truth. 9 days left. Will you rush a donation of $5 or more to help Brad get out the facts to Illinois voters?
David Johnson DEADLINE: 48 HOURS
## DONATION PENDING ##
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Brad&rsquo;s in a down-to-the-wire fight.
He&rsquo;s working day and night to make sure Illinois&rsquo;s 10th District is represented by a Democrat -- not a reliable Republican.
But Tuesday marks exactly ONE WEEK out from Election Day and our last MAJOR deadline of the election.
After that, it could be too late to make a difference.
So David, please chip in to have Brad&rsquo;s back before it&rsquo;s too late. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/9-days
Let&rsquo;s finish strong!
