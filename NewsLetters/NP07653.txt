Dear Friend, Medicare is a promise we make to ourselves.
It&rsquo;s a promise that says, If you work hard and pay into the system, we will take care of you as you get older and have greater health care needs. It&rsquo;s a promise that says, when you retire, that investment you've made throughout your working life will free you from worrying about choosing between medicine and food.
It&rsquo;s a promise that we&rsquo;ve upheld for 49 years. But it&rsquo;s also a promise that Republicans like Paul Ryan want to break. I&rsquo;ve always fought to protect Medicare, and today, I&rsquo;m asking you to join me and my colleagues in supporting Medicare on its 49th anniversary. Click here to sign our petition.
The promise of Medicare has served us well for 49 years. It&rsquo;s a promise of guaranteed medical benefits, rather than vouchers for private-market insurance. It&rsquo;s a promise that we will not abandon you once you stop working, because you are worth more than just your labor. And it&rsquo;s a promise I intend to keep. With your help, we&rsquo;ll preserve the time-tested, guaranteed benefits of Medicare for another half century. Add your name to our petition.
Thank you for supporting Medicare.
