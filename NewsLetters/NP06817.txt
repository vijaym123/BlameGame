Stoney Creek Town Hall Meeting
Dear Friend,
As you may know, I try to hold as many town hall meetings as possible for constituents in the First District. I want to keep East Tennesseans informed and would also like to hear what's on your mind.
My door is always open, but I realize it can be difficult to make it to one of my offices. I wanted to let you know that I'll be hosting a town hall meeting at Unaka Elementary School in Stoney Creek on Tuesday, September 2, 2014. The event is free, open to the public and no ticket is required to attend. We'll get started at 6:30. I hope to see you there!
What:
Congressman Roe Town Hall Meeting
When:
Tuesday, September 2nd at 6:30 p.m.
Where:
Unaka Elementary School in Stoney Creek
Please do not hesitate to contact any of my offices if you have questions about this meeting. My contact information can be found below or by visiting www.roe.house.gov. As always, it is a pleasure to serve the First District.
Thank you,
Phil
