Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
Student loan debt is at an all-time high.
Over the past ten years, the
amount of outstanding student loan debt has skyrocketed from $300
billion to nearly $1 trillion -- while the median income for those with
a bachelor's degree has markedly declined.
In fact, one study found
that a whopping 44% of recent college graduates are employed in a job
that does not require a college degree at all.
Accumulating ever-increasing amounts of debt in order to finance
ever-increasing college tuition, only to end up in a job that could
have been obtained straight out of high school, is a formula that is
failing millions of students nationwide.
Next week, I will be
introducing a higher education reform bill that will help provide more
opportunities for students.
The goal is for students to equip
themselves with more skills, not more debt.
There have been disturbing reports that as many as 40 veterans in
Phoenix died waiting for care from the Veterans Administration while
being placed on a "secret waiting list." Our nation's veterans placed
their lives on the line in defense of our freedoms and deserve timely
and quality care. The patient backlog and mismanagement at the VA is a
national disgrace.
In order to help restore accountability at the VA, I have co-sponsored
the VA Management Accountability Act. This legislation would give the
Secretary of the VA the necessary authority to hold poorly-performing
VA managers accountable for their failures.
The VA is a big,
cumbersome bureaucracy and without robust accountability I fear it will
continue to deliver substandard services to millions of our veterans.
This week, there were several new disturbing revelations regarding the
terror attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans citizens.
Retired US Air Force Brigadier General Robert Lovell testified before
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that, as the deputy
head of military intelligence for the Africa region on 9/11/2012, he
knew immediately that what happened at Benghazi was an attack, not a
protest.
In spite of this, Gen. Lovell testified that the State Department did
not request military assistance from AFRICOM after the attack
commenced.
While many have claimed that in hindsight we wouldn't have
been able to marshal our forces in time, at the time we had no idea how
long the attack would last. The excuse that we "wouldn't have gotten
there in time" simply does not satisfy me, and Gen. Lovell agreed.
Watch my line of questioning with Brigadier General Lovell by clicking
here.
Even if we had been too late to help, I believe that it would have
mattered to the American people that we had made the effort. That we
were willing as a nation to devote the resources we had to try and save
those men. I think it would have mattered to the families that now
mourn their fallen relatives.
Furthermore, a lawsuit has uncovered new e-mails from the days after
the attack, which reveal that the White House helped coordinate a PR
push based on false information. They deliberately deceived the
American people by downplaying the terror aspect and blaming the attack
on a YouTube video.
Of course, the perpetrators of the attack have, to
this day, still not been brought to justice.
It's clear that the White House was more interested in insulating
President Obama than responding to this attack on US forces. Watch my
"On the Record" interview with Greta Van Susteren on these developments
by clicking here.
On Friday, Speaker John Boehner announced that he will support a select
committee convened for the purpose of obtaining the truth about the
Benghazi attacks.
I have been supportive of this idea for a long time.
Americans deserve the truth about what happened that night.
Rep. DeSantis with the winner of the 2014 Congressional Art
Competition, Yong Zheng from Seabreeze High School, and her winning
painting "Into the Light."
Last weekend, the top 10 finalists in the Congressional Art Competition
were judged by Diane Bradley, President of the St. Augustine Art
Association and local artist Jean Wagner Troemel, at a reception held
at Flagler Palm Coast High School.
Yong Zheng from Seabreeze High School took first place with her ink
wash painting titled "Into the Light." Congratulations to Yong for
being chosen to represent Florida's sixth district in this year's
Congressional Art Competition! I look forward to seeing her painting
hanging in the United States Capitol.
I would also like to thank all of the students who participated for
sharing their creative talent and beautiful artwork. Photos of the
reception can be found here.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
Student
loan
debt
is
at
an
all-time
high.
Over
the
past
ten
years,
the
amount
of
outstanding
student
loan
debt
has
skyrocketed
from
$300
billion
to
nearly
$1
trillion
--
while
the
median
income
for
those
with
a
bachelor's
degree
has
markedly
declined.
In
fact,
one
study
found
that
a
whopping
44%
of
recent
college
graduates
are
employed
in
a
job
that
does
not
require
a
college
degree
at
all.
Accumulating
ever-increasing
amounts
of
debt
in
order
to
finance
ever-increasing
college
tuition,
only
to
end
up
in
a
job
that
could
have
been
obtained
straight
out
of
high
school,
is
a
formula
that
is
failing
millions
of
students
nationwide.
Next
week,
I
will
be
introducing
a
higher
education
reform
bill
that
will
help
provide
more
opportunities
for
students.
The
goal
is
for
students
to
equip
themselves
with
more
skills,
not
more
debt.
There
have
been
disturbing
reports
that
as
many
as
40
veterans
in
Phoenix
died
waiting
for
care
from
the
Veterans
Administration
while
being
placed
on
a
"secret
waiting
list."
Our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
placed
their
lives
on
the
line
in
defense
of
our
freedoms
and
deserve
timely
and
quality
care.
The
patient
backlog
and
mismanagement
at
the
VA
is
a
national
disgrace.
In
order
to
help
restore
accountability
at
the
VA,
I
have
co-sponsored
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act.
This
legislation
would
give
the
Secretary
of
the
VA
the
necessary
authority
to
hold
poorly-performing
VA
managers
accountable
for
their
failures.
The
VA
is
a
big,
cumbersome
bureaucracy
and
without
robust
accountability
I
fear
it
will
continue
to
deliver
substandard
services
to
millions
of
our
veterans.
This
week,
there
were
several
new
disturbing
revelations
regarding
the
terror
attack
in
Benghazi
that
killed
four
Americans
citizens.
Retired
US
Air
Force
Brigadier
General
Robert
Lovell
testified
before
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
that,
as
the
deputy
head
of
military
intelligence
for
the
Africa
region
on
9/11/2012,
he
knew
immediately
that
what
happened
at
Benghazi
was
an
attack,
not
a
protest.
In
spite
of
this,
Gen.
Lovell
testified
that
the
State
Department
did
not
request
military
assistance
from
AFRICOM
after
the
attack
commenced.
While
many
have
claimed
that
in
hindsight
we
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
marshal
our
forces
in
time,
at
the
time
we
had
no
idea
how
long
the
attack
would
last.
The
excuse
that
we
&#8220;wouldn&#8217;t
have
gotten
there
in
time&#8221;
simply
does
not
satisfy
me,
and
Gen.
Lovell
agreed.
Watch
my
line
of
questioning
with
Brigadier
General
Lovell
by
clicking
here.
Even
if
we
had
been
too
late
to
help,
I
believe
that
it
would
have
mattered
to
the
American
people
that
we
had
made
the
effort.
That
we
were
willing
as
a
nation
to
devote
the
resources
we
had
to
try
and
save
those
men.
I
think
it
would
have
mattered
to
the
families
that
now
mourn
their
fallen
relatives.
Furthermore,
a
lawsuit
has
uncovered
new
e-mails
from
the
days
after
the
attack,
which
reveal
that
the
White
House
helped
coordinate
a
PR
push
based
on
false
information.
They
deliberately
deceived
the
American
people
by
downplaying
the
terror
aspect
and
blaming
the
attack
on
a
YouTube
video.
Of
course,
the
perpetrators
of
the
attack
have,
to
this
day,
still
not
been
brought
to
justice.
It's
clear
that
the
White
House
was
more
interested
in
insulating
President
Obama
than
responding
to
this
attack
on
US
forces.

my
"On
the
Record"
interview
with
Greta
Van
Susteren

these
developments

announced
that
he

the
Benghazi
attacks.
I
have

about
what
happened
that
night.
