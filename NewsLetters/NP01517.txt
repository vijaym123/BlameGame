Dear Friends,
Spring is here, and so is tax season. As you file your 2014 taxes, I
want to share the ways that Delaware and the IRS can help you save time
and money.
The IRSs Filing Your Taxes website
provides all of the
information you need to get started, and steps for filing your
individual tax return quickly and easily. They also give you options
for how to file your taxes. If youre comfortable doing your taxes and
determining your potential tax credits on your own, the IRS offers Free
File software
or paper forms
at no cost. You can also use Free File to get an extension
of time to file, but make sure to pay by April 15 or you may face a
penalty or interest.
If you would like assistance in navigating the tax forms, call
302-286-1654 Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or visit
one of Delawares IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers for help and
assurance that you are filing your taxes correctly:
Kent County: 611 S. Dupont Hwy., Dover, DE 19901
New Castle County: 844 King St., Wilmington, DE 19801
Sussex County: 21309 Berlin Rd. Unit 13, Georgetown, DE 19947
For elderly or low- to moderate-income people who cannot prepare their
own taxes, the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA) and
Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) provide free, in-person help. To
find the nearest VITA or TCE program, visit the VITA/TCE information
page
.
The IRS estimates
that nearly 5,000 Delawareans are eligible for a 2011 tax refund
averaging about $700. If you haven't filed your 2011 return and think
you should receive a refund, you can get the money you're owed by
filing that return by April 15. Information on how to do so can be
found here
.
Finally, a few months ago I wrote to you about the Earned Income Tax
Credit, or EITC
. This is an easy, simple tax refund that may be
available to workers who earned up to $52,427 in 2014. EITCs can be as
high as $6,143 for workers with qualifying children, or $496 for
workers without. I encourage you to find out if you are eligible
for an EITC and how to file it
.
I hope these resources make your tax filing process as smooth as
possible. Please feel free to reach out to me about this, or any other
issue, through email or by contacting me on Twitter @SenatorCarper and
on Facebook at facebook.com/tomcarper.

Dear
Friends,
Spring
is
here,
and
so
is
tax
season.
As
you
file
your
2014
taxes,
I
want
to
share
the
ways
that
Delaware
and
the
IRS
can
help
you
save
time
and
money.
The
IRS&#146;s
&#147;Filing
Your
Taxes&#148;
website
provides
all
of
the
information
you
need
to
get
started,
and
steps
for
filing
your
individual
tax
return
quickly
and
easily.
They
also
give
you
options
for
how
to
file
your
taxes.
If
you&#146;re
comfortable
doing
your
taxes
and
determining
your
potential
tax
credits
on
your
own,
the
IRS
offers
Free
File
software
or
paper
forms
at
no
cost.
You
can
also
use
Free
File
to
get
an
extension
of
time
to
file,
but
make
sure
to
pay
by
April
15 or
you
may
face
a
penalty
or
interest.
If
you
would
like
assistance
in
navigating
the
tax
forms,
call
302-286-1654 Monday
through
Friday
from
8:30

to
4:30
p.m. or

one
of
Delaware&#146;s

you

money
you're

Information

can
be
found

Finally,
a
few
months
ago
I
wrote
to
you
about
the
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit,
or
EITC .
This
is
an
easy,
simple
tax
refund
that
may
be

EITCs
can
be
as
high
as

children,
or
$496
for
workers
without.
I
encourage
you
to
find
out
if
you
are
eligible
for
an
EITC
and
how
to
file
it .
I
hope
these
resources
make
your
tax
filing
process
as
smooth
as
possible.
