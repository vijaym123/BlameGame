The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of February 10 - 14, 2014
This week, I voted against a bill that would raise our nation's debt
ceiling without any spending cuts and reforms. One of my top priorities
in Congress is to fight Washington's out-of-control spending and pay
down our $17 trillion debt.
Increasing the debt limit without
meaningful and responsible reductions in government spending is bad for
our economy, bad for businesses, and bad for North Texas families. I
will continue to fight to reduce the size of our bloated government,
cut our nation's unsustainable levels of spending, and remove the
burden of debt from future generations.
Also this week, the House approved a bill to restore the military
retirement cost-of-living-adjustment. I was proud to vote in favor of a
bill to ensure that our military men and women do not see a reduction
in the established retirement benefits that they have been promised. I
strongly believe that we must preserve the commitment made to our
nation's brave men and women in uniform who have selflessly sacrificed
to preserve the freedoms we enjoy as Americans. I'm pleased to report
that the Senate also approved this bill and it will be signed by
President Obama.
Constituent Meetings
In addition to legislative business, I had several constituent meetings
this week.
While in DC for votes at the beginning of the week, I met
with the new President of the Dallas Fraternal Order of Police (Lodge
588), as well as students from Dallas Community College District who
were in Washington to discuss education issues in Dallas County. I also
met with a constituent from the Commercial Real Estate Development
Association to discuss the integral role that the real estate market
plays in our economy and ways to improve free-enterprise through a more
competitive tax code.

Parish Episcopal School
On Thursday, I was delighted to speak to juniors and seniors in a
leadership class at Parish Episcopal School in Dallas.
I talked with
them about my work as a Member of Congress and we discussed the
importance of courage, character, and other qualities of a true leader.

C.C. Young Retirement Community
Also on Thursday, I visited with seniors at the C.C. Young retirement
community in Dallas. We discussed several issues including the impact
of ObamaCare on health care and Medicare and the burden of debt being
placed on future generations by Washington's unrestrained spending.
Congressman Sessions speaking to seniors at the CC Young Retirement
Community
I always value the opportunity to learn more about the issues most
important to North Texas seniors and I appreciated the residents at CC
Young Retirement Community inviting me to visit with them.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

This

I

Increasing
the

is
bad
for
our

bad
for

bloated
government,
cut
our
nation&#8217;s
unsustainable
levels
of
spending,
and
