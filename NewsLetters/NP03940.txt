Congressman Lamborn
Statement on Release of CIA Interrogation
Report
12/9/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following statement
upon the release of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report
on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation
Program.
"The partisan conclusions reached in the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on CIA enhanced
interrogation techniques is designed to humiliate our nation and the intelligence
community.
It also has the potential to endanger the lives of
Americans.
I believe in transparent government, but I also
believe in a government that is able to use all the tools at its legal
disposal to protect American citizens.
There should be no doubt that
harsh interrogation techniques produced actionable intelligence from a
handful of terrorists that could not have been obtained any other
way.
There is a real danger that this report could imperil our
ongoing intelligence gathering partnerships, techniques, and
capabilities."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
