UPDATE: Moments after President Obama emailed you this morning, Speaker Boehner came out with a diatribe against the President.
In a USA Today op-ed, Boehner announced that --
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
-- Republicans will hold a vote to sue the President on the House floor. Boehner even had the nerve to accuse the President of
breaking the law . It&rsquo;s a major slap in the face.
We need to get the President&rsquo;s back on this. We want to get to 1OO,OOO Democrats responding to President Obama&rsquo;s call to action before the vote. Will you help us deal a CRUSHING BLOW to Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans? Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00 ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
