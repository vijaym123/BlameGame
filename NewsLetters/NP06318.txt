&ldquo;[Koch brothers] donated $120m to more than 100 anti-climate groups working to discredit climate change science&rdquo; --
The Guardian , 2/14/13
Dear Friend, If you ever hear someone claim that &ldquo;the jury is still out on climate change,&rdquo; you can blame a lot of it on the Koch brothers.
These big oil billionaires have spent
more than a hundred million dollars
on groups dedicated to making the public doubt established science.
The Kochs are bringing a similar strategy to this year&rsquo;s elections -- bankroll scurrilous attacks (44,000 of them so far), then watch as their special interest agenda gets a few more supporters in Washington. We know we need to act on climate change -- and we know the Kochs are spending big to keep that from happening. Give $5 and support a Senate that takes climate change seriously.

You and I have long recognized the perils of climate change. If sea levels rise as much as they&rsquo;re expected to, portions of the Massachusetts coast could end up underwater.
That&rsquo;s part of why I introduced the only climate change bill to ever pass a house of Congress. But if Republicans pick up six seats this November, the Koch brothers will have succeeded in stacking the Senate with their supporters. We simply cannot allow Massachusetts to be a Republican pick up this year. Contribute $5 toward our $145,000 goal before the FEC deadline and help us keep fighting.
Thank you.
