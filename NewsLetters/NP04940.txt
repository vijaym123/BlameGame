&ldquo;Republicans are getting ready to party on Election Night.&rdquo;
--
Politico , 10/22/2014
Dear Friend,
I don&rsquo;t know if Republicans have their confetti ready just yet, but I do know they&rsquo;re planning to throw a big election-night party in Washington -- live band, &ldquo;300 to 400 people&rdquo; according to
Politico , the whole nine yards. Republicans are feeling pretty good about their chances this year.
They could be ecstatic on election night if we don&rsquo;t fight back. We can crash the Republicans&rsquo; election-night party, but only if we make the most of the last days of this campaign. Chip in $5 right now to help us get out the vote.

The battle for control of the Senate is going to come down to the wire. We may not know the final results until late at night on Election Day, and there&rsquo;s a real possibility of runoffs in a couple races.
But the Republicans are planning their party anyway -- and I want to make sure we don&rsquo;t give them a reason to celebrate.
Give $5 towards our final $16O,OOO end-of-month goal before Election Day and give our field team what it needs to win this thing.
Here in Massachusetts, we&rsquo;re not taking a single vote for granted. Over the last 6 days of this campaign, let&rsquo;s work hard and do our best to crash the GOP&rsquo;s party.
