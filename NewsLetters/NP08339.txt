Recently, the IRS
unveiled
their new taxpayer bill of rights, as part of the IRS efforts to rebuild trust with the American people and demonstrate that the Agency is looking out for taxpayers. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said this bill of rights would become a cornerstone document for the nations taxpayers.
I disagree. The ONLY way to begin restoring trust in the wake of abuses at the IRS is to immediately appoint an independent special counsel to the IRS investigation. If the IRS truly has nothing to hide, then it would seem they would be the first to agree to the appointment of a special counsel, since bringing in an independent party would be the fastest way to restore credibility and trust with the American people. And, if they do have something to hide, then an independent counsel is all the more critical.
Bottom-line:
The American people dont want a slick taxpayer bill of rights or public relations push, they want the truth.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I have
called for
the immediate appointment of an independent special counsel to the IRS investigation. Commissioner Koskinen, however, said that an independent counsel would be a monumental waste of taxpayer funds.
