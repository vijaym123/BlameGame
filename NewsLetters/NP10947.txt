As the snow thaws to warmer months, new potholes and signs of road deterioration are certain to appear on our daily commutes. Although this is the reality of a harsh winter, it also serves as a reminder of how quickly the state of our transportation and infrastructure can decline.
With that in mind, I have a question for you: what are your thoughts on the transportation issues facing our nation? If you can take a few moments to fill out the

below, I would like to hear your feedback.
Yours in service,
Randy
