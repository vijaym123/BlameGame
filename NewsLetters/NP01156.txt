Friend,
I just spoke with our donors this morning and they are skeptical whether we will hit our goal of $5,000 by midnight tonight.
They want us to make it, but don&rsquo;t think it is possible.
I told them we can do it; In fact, I know we can do it.
But it is going to take a team effort because
we only have 13 hours and just over $2,000 to go.
Time is running out-- will you chip in $5 or more in the next 13 hours and have your contribution doubled?
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $25 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in other amount immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
It&rsquo;s not often that a group of donors will match all contributions up to $5,000 and
we need to take full advantage of this opportunity.
I have faith we can do this
and want to show our donors the strength of our team. Every dollar gets us closer to completing our match and there is no time to waste.
We have $2,000 to go&mdash; please pitch in here.
Be well,
Ami
