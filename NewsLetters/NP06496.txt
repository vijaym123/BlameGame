Dear David,
The year 1969 may seem like a very distant memory to some, or for others a time long-before they were born, but for a St. Peters man it was a year he showed extraordinary bravery.
Forty-five years after being wounded in action in Vietnam, veteran Patrick Howe was finally awarded a Purple Heart with two Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters. While originally awarded a Purple Heart with a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster to recognize two of the three wounds he suffered, his third wound was recorded but overlooked in his Service Treatment Records.
This week however, that error was
finally corrected .
As I watched Mr. Howe - surrounded by family - receive his much-deserved recognition, I was reminded once again why keeping our promise to our brave veterans is one of the most important jobs I have. That's why I was honored when Mr. Howe contacted my office earlier this year seeking assistance in notifying the Army of their error.
This week - nearly five decades later - the full extent of Mr. Howe's bravery was no longer overlooked, reminding us all that it's never too late to recognize the service of others.
All the best,
P.S. As always, I want to hear from you about the issues impacting Missouri veterans. Contact me via
