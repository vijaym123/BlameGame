Heller Presses VA Secretary Shinseki
for Bolder Action to Fix Problems Plaguing
Veterans in Nevada
Asks for Specific Answers to Questions
about Potential Changes in Nevada
(Washington, D.C.)
Today,
U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) sent a
letter to Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) Secretary Eric Shinseki asking him to
clarify what he intends to do about the
persistent problems within Nevadas
VA system, which have compromised the
benefits and care available to the
states veterans.
In the letter, Heller follows up on
commitments that Secretary Shinseki made to
enforce changes in the regional
office. Additionally, given recent
allegations about long wait times that may
have led to the deaths of veterans at the
Phoenix VA hospital, Heller also asks
Shinseki to provide answers about the wait
times in the Nevada system.
A response is requested by May 21, 2014.

The Honorable Eric K. Shinseki
Secretary of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20420
Dear Secretary Shinseki:
I am writing to you regarding my
continued, serious concerns for
Nevadas Veterans due to the lack of
accountability and transparency at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which
has led to an unacceptable lapse in
services, care, and benefits to our
Veterans. As a member of the Senate
Veterans Affairs Committee and as
Co-Chair of the Senate VA Backlog Working
Group, I appreciate the opportunity to
contact you about this issue critical to
Veterans across my state.
Serving Nevadas Veterans and
ensuring they receive quality medical care
at VAs facilities and timely
delivery of benefits has always been a
priority of mine. I have worked in a
bipartisan manner to address these issues
and have tried to work with the VA to
improve its care and services so that our
nation keeps the promises it has made to
the brave men and women who have sacrificed
on our behalf. However, Nevada continues to
have the lowest-performing VA Regional
Office in the nation. Furthermore,
timeliness of appointments, availability of
care, and treatment of Veterans at the Las
Vegas VA Medical Center remain a concern of
mine.
When I met with you in February, you
promised that there would be changes in
Nevada, and I was hopeful that this
commitment would help fix the problems
plaguing Veterans benefits and care
in my state. Today, changes have still not
been made. I sent a letter to the VA, with
my colleagues, regarding serious concerns
with VA communication on a local
level. There still has not been a
resolution to this critical issue. In fact,
despite repeated requests from my staff,
your agency has yet to honor those requests
to resolve the problem.
My concern is that this lapse in
accountability on a local level is
indicative of a systemic problem across the
VA. If changes are not going to be
made at the local level to address the
problems plaguing the VA system in Nevada,
then changes may need to be made at the
top.
As a member of the Senate
Veterans Affairs Committee and as a
U.S. Senator representing the State of
Nevada, I believe immediate Congressional
oversight of the VA is necessary to ensure
that the problems impacting Veterans in
Nevada are addressed immediately.
That is why I respectfully request answers
to the following questions:
What changes does the VA plan to make
at the VA Regional Office in Reno to
address the fact that Nevada Veterans
continue to experience the longest wait
in the nation for their disability claims
to be approved and when will these
changes go into effect?
When will the Reno VA Regional Office
respond to my colleagues and my requests
to conduct a meeting to resolve concerns
with responsiveness to Congressional
inquiries on behalf of Veterans?
What actions has the VA taken and
plans to take to ensure that the Reno and
Las Vegas VA hospitals and the Community
Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) across
the state are utilizing proper
appointment wait-time and scheduling
policies?
Given that VA appointment wait times
impact the backlog of Veterans
disability claims, I respectfully request
that the VA provide appropriate data
regarding appointment wait times for
Compensation and Pension (C&amp;P)
disability examinations at VA medical
facilities in Nevada.
Thank you for your attention to this
matter, and I respectfully request your
input on the above questions no later than
May 21, 2014.
Sincerely,
Dean Heller
