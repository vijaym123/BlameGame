Dear Fellow Nevadan,
This
July marks the twenty-fourth anniversary of Congress passing the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which has since protected equal
opportunity for Nevadans and Americans with disabilities. The ADA was a
landmark civil rights achievement in the United States and it inspired an
international movement to protect civil rights world-wide. This month
we remind ourselves of the promise ADA seeks to fulfill: to grant
individuals with disabilities freedom to fully participate as members of
their community.
Through the ADA, barriers to public
accommodations, employment, transportation, public services, and
telecommunications have been diminished. Children can no longer be prevented from
attending a school, afterschool, or daycare program based on their
disabilities. Individuals can no longer be denied employment, fair
compensation, or be discharged based on their disabilities. The protections
of the ADA are common sense and so vital to the interest of Democracy,
which demands every free citizens ability to participate. Thats why
I was so proud to cosponsor legislation in 2008 to strengthen the ADA
and further protect the rights of persons with
disabilities.
While weve made great strides to ensure that the civil rights of
all Americans are protected, there is still work to be done.
Ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,
which was inspired by the ADA, was shamefully blocked in Congress this
session. But that did not mark the end. I look forward to bringing the
CRPD to the Senate floor in the near future so the US can reiterate
its commitment to protecting the civil rights of its
citizens.
