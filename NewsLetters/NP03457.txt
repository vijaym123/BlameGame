The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last week, my family joined me in freezing temperatures as the 114th Congress convened to begin a new term in Washington, DC. Following the November elections, I had written an article that I shared with Members of Congress called
Widgets, Principles, and Republicans
that you can
read here .
On Tuesday morning, I was nominated me to be a candidate for Speaker of the House, and was humbled and honored by the confidence that many Members of Congress placed in me.
My candidacy and vote for Speaker of the House was not a vote against personalities or policies.
It was a vote for initiating a process that I know can produce sound public policy for the people who sent us to Washington on their behalf.
I will continue to advocate for a more open, Member-driven and productive process that promotes principle above power.
The process by which we have come to legislate as elected representatives of the people has become flawed, and a flawed process will always produce a flawed product.

Last Wednesday morning, I called in to Bud Hedingers radio show to talk about my vote for Speaker of the House. Portions of my interview included the reason on
why I chose to allow myself to be nominated as a candidate for Speaker , as well as my
greatest desire to lead with principles
and make every Member successful within Congress. I also explained what I mean by
a principle-based system of government,
as opposed to one that is built on power.

On Friday evening, I was privileged to participate in the grand opening of the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation History Research and Education Center. During the program, I shared a portion of Winter Gardens recent history and development that has attracted nearly one million visitors to our area annually. The Winter Garden Heritage Foundation has done a wonderful job in uniting the community to embrace our history and encourage renovation of the old dilapidated brick buildings downtown to help foster a community of incredible charm.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Following a serious fall, a constituent from Leesburg applied for Social Security Disability (SSD) since she was no longer able to work. Over the next several months, the constituent had three surgeries and began experiencing memory loss due to her medications. Since she had still not heard back from SSD, the constituent contacted my office regarding her situation.
My office submitted a Congressional Inquiry and continued to monitor her case as it progressed through the appeals and hearing process. Eventually, we received notice that a favorable decision had been made in the constituents case, and later received a phone call from her expressing her appreciation for our help and services.
Although the Webster Wire regularly highlights one instance of how we assist constituents, last year alone we submitted more than 870 Congressional Inquiries to federal agencies on your behalf.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
As the House and Senate reconvened and once again took up consideration of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the White House issued a statement declaring the Presidents intention to veto the legislation, even before the new members were sworn in.
Do you believe that President Obama should work with the House and Senate to advance policies and projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline that will grow our economy and benefit the American people?

Legislative Update:
As we began a new legislative session last week, the House passed two important bills that will continue our work to build a strong economy and spur economic growth. Due to Obamacare, there has been a movement in recent years to redefine what constitutes a full-time work week. I support the traditional 40 hour work week, and was pleased to co-sponsor and join my colleagues in the House of Representatives in passing H.R. 30, the Save American Workers (SAW) Act, which reaffirms this standard in the American workplace and protects the potential wages of millions of American workers.
Last Friday, I voted to support H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. For over six years, the Keystone XL Pipeline has held the potential for economic benefits, thousands of new jobs, and increased availability of North American energy reserves. With a willing partner in the Senate, I am hoping that the legislation authorizing the Pipeline will soon be on President Obamas desk and that he will sign this critical infrastructure project.
