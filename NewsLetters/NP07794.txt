Rep. Lipinski Reacts to House
Passing Bill to Prevent Cutback in Road Construction and Transit
Funding
This week, the House of Representatives passed H.R.
5021, a bill to move about $10 billion into the Highway Trust Fund to
prevent a cutback in road construction and transit funding.
If
additional money is not transferred to the fund, federal spending on road
construction will start being slashed on August 1.
The bill
passed this week will extend federal highway and transit funding to the
spring.
Statement from Congressman Dan Lipinski
(IL-3):
Im pleased that we
seem to be resolving the funding shortfall without unnecessary politics
and posturing.
We should not be cutting construction jobs and
stopping projects we know are needed to fix our roads and transit.
That being said, Im disappointed that we have kicked the can down the
road into next year on a more permanent solution to this critical
issue.
We should roll up our sleeves and get to work on a
long-term bill that provides the level of funding we know our area and our
nation need for road construction and transit, and we should be doing
this before the end of the year.
We need to get serious about
long-term funding solutions instead of searching the couches for change
every few months or
years.
Rep.
Lipinskis Bill Renaming Mount Greenwood Post Office for Fallen
Firefighter Capt. Herbie Johnson Passes
House
The House of Representatives passed Congressman
Dan Lipinskis (IL-3) bill, H.R. 3085, this week renaming Chicagos
Mount Greenwood post office as the Captain Herbert Johnson Memorial Post
Office Building.
Captain Herbert Herbie Johnson died on
November 2, 2012, at the age of 54, while battling flames in the attic of a
two-story home in Chicagos Englewood neighborhood.
Naming a postal facility
honoring Fire Capt. Johnson is just a small tribute of our appreciation not
only for him, but all first responders who bravely put their lives on
the line every day for people they dont even know, Rep. Lipinski
stated.
This post office naming will ensure that Capt. Herbie
Johnson, his family, and the sacrifices of all first responders will always
be remembered and appreciated, and will hopefully serve as a powerful
source of inspiration in the
community.
The post office building is located at 3349 West
111th Street in Chicago.
H.R. 3085 now moves on to the
Senate.

Rep. Lipinskis Bill Improving International Collaboration on Science
and Technology Research Passes House
Congressman Dan Lipinskis (IL-3) International Science and Technology
Cooperation Act of 2014 was passed by the House of Representatives this
week 346-41.
The bill would improve U.S. diplomatic efforts in
cooperating on scientific research, which would help address key
challenges facing our nation, including energy production, public health,
national security, and job creation.
The legislation
specifically directs the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) at the
White House to maintain a body that would identify and coordinate the
U.S. interagency strategy for international science and technology
cooperation.
In addition, it requires the NSTC to report back to
Congress on their activities to ensure appropriate oversight by the
legislative branch.
By collaborating with international partners on scientific
issues, we strengthen the U.S. scientific enterprise and additionally
promote the free exchange of ideas in other nations, Rep. Lipinski
said.
While many federal agencies are engaged with international
partners on science and technology projects, there is a need to
coordinate these projects across the federal government and to identify
opportunities for additional beneficial collaborations.
Coordination
on international scientific research ensures that tax dollars are being
used efficiently and that U.S. priorities are being consistently
addressed when working with our international partners on science and
technology issues.
Rep.
Lipinski is the top Democrat on the Research and Technology Subcommittee
of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.
The bill
now moves on to the Senate.
