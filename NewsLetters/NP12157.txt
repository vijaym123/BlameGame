Dear Friends,
This week I was happy to be at home and meeting with constituents in
the 10th congressional district.
On Wednesday I was honored to be a part of, and speak at, a donation
event for the
Andrew McDonough B+ Foundation
hosted by the University of Texas chapters of Sigma Chi and
Alpha Epsilon Phi.
The B+ Foundation provides financial and emotional
support for families of children with cancer and funds childhood cancer
research.
The UT Greek organizations were able to donate $65,316, an
inspiring amount.
This past week the FDA approved the first voucher under the Creating
Hope Act
, a law I passed that provides
incentives to drug makers to develop treatments for kids with rare
diseases including cancer.
This news demonstrates that the Creating
Hope Act is forging a viable path to produce childhood cancer
treatments that would otherwise not be available.
I'm hopeful that
more pharmaceutical companies will line up to take this same approach.
This week I also addressed the Texas Cyber Security Forum in Austin.
I
discussed the importance of securing our critical infrastructure and my
bill, the the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure
Protection Act, HR 3696
.
This legislation, which has passed unanimously out of the Homeland
Security Committee, which I chair, will help protect our critical
infrastructure against cyber threats.
On Tuesday I addressed the Cy-Fair Chamber of Commerce meeting and
discussed
with business leaders in the community what is going
on in Washington. Job creators and small business owners are the
backbone of our economy and the work they do reinforces my belief that
we need to continue to pass legislation that will unleash the economic
engine of America in order to help get the millions of Americans who
need a job hired once again.
With Best Regards,
