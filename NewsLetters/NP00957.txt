Dear Friends,
Terrorists struck on American soil last weekend when two armed jihadists attempted to storm an event in Garland, Texas, that was displaying cartoons of Mohammad. Thanks
to quick action by a police officer, the casualties were limited to one security guard being shot in the foot &#8211; as well as the two attackers, who were killed before they could commit the atrocity they had planned.
The threat posed by Islamist extremists has rapidly grown more severe. The Islamic State controls wide swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, while al Qaeda groups continue
to spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Many of these groups now have battlefield experience and terrorism credentials, deep support networks, and the ability to broadcast their propaganda worldwide through social media.
This critical threat is not confined to the Middle East. Like the murderous attacks in Paris earlier this year, the Garland assault shows that Islamist terrorists have
a wide reach throughout the world. Those who believe the jihadists will spare the U.S. if we simply withdraw from our position of world leadership are deluding themselves. This movement does not make limited demands that can be appeased. Like Communism, its
adherents are openly, proudly intent on world domination, and they will continue pursuing that goal until they are decisively defeated.
Separately, the Nunes Digest is updated for your weekend reading
here .
Sincerely,
Devin Nunes
