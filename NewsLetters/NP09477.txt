This
Memorial Day, I will be speaking at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery to pay
tribute to those brave Idahoans who made the ultimate sacrifice in
defense of our country.
On this day
as with every Memorial Day
we honor Idahos heroes with a humble heart.
We express our
deepest gratitude and appreciation.
And we reflect on what these
courageous men and women gave their lives for
the freedom and security
of the greatest country in the history of the world.
Let there be no mistake: America is the Land of
the Free because we truly are the Home of the Brave.
We are
the home of great patriots who have willingly shouldered the burden for
our safety, generation after generation.
On so many battlefields
in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and other parts of the world
they have heeded the call to service, they have fought on the
frontlines, and they have showed the true measure of American character.
To those who never made it back home: No words can express the depth of
our gratitude.
We will never forget them.
We will always
keep the flame of memory alive.
As a member of Congress, the greatest honor I have is
recognizing and helping our service members and veterans.
Thats why
I have made constituent service
especially for Idahos veterans
my
top priority.
Over the years, my office has been the go-to
location for veterans in our district who need help navigating the
federal bureaucracy and getting the services they deserve.
So far this year, my office has been able to
help hundreds of veterans and returned over $800,000 to Idaho
veterans and their families.
Additionally, my office has worked with
other federal agencies to return over $1.3 million back to Idaho.
If youre a veteran
or know a veteran - whos having problems with
the federal government ,
please go to my Constituent Services
webpage

I am so proud of our military men and women in
Idaho.
May God bless them, and may God
continue
to bless the
United States of America.
