Blaine's Bulletin
As I sat down to write the weekly bulletin, I knew I wanted to discuss Roe v. Wade since the anniversary of that court decision occurs in the month of January. In the past whenever I have written the bulletin on this issue, I normally talk about legislation that I have sponsored or cosponsored or my unwavering commitment to the sanctity of life and the pro-life cause. None of that has changed; however, I wanted to take a different approach this year.
The gift of life is not only sacred but it should be celebrated. If I was not granted the gift of life, I would not have had the opportunity to sit here and put my thoughts on paper, or watch my children grow into adults, or even watch my grandchildren grow into their own individual people. However, its just as important to celebrate the little things we are granted each day. Whether its waking up and drinking morning coffee, walking your child to the school bus, or gathering your family around the dinner table to discuss the day.
Last year, the pro-life community was able to celebrate a small, yet significant, victory. Last summer, the Supreme Court made its final ruling on the Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. court case that reversed the rule from the Department of Health and Human Services so that closely held, for-profit corporations, such as family businesses, cannot be required to provide coverage for services that the owners find morally objectionable. That is a decision that was and should be celebrated as it was a landmark day for religious freedom in our country.
This year, just like every year since the Roe v. Wade decisions, thousands of people will make their way to Washington to participate in the annual March for Life. It is especially gratifying to see so many young people take the time and make the effort to make their voices heard in our nations capital on this important issue. And while this is just one day, I know it is the culmination of another years worth of planning and work. I am hopeful that, one day, we will not need to have this annual gathering in Washington, but, until Roe v. Wade is reversed, I have the utmost faith that many Missourians will continue to make the trip to Washington on behalf of the unborn.
Life is a celebration. Those who are out there, all year round and year after year, defending the life of the unborn should also be celebrated. So, I want to thank you. Thank you for the inspiration and support that you provide me and other pro-life legislators. I will remain steadfast and committed to ensuring pro-life legislation moves forward in the House of Representatives.
