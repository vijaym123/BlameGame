Marchant Votes "NO" on $ 1.1 T Spending Bill
I voted against the $1.1 trillion "cromnibus" spending bill because it is a continuation of the same business as usual in Washington that Americans have so clearly rejected. The bill fails to strip the president of the funding needed to move forward with his unilateral amnesty. It also lets the same Senate the American people just voted out cement their misguided spending priorities into the budget for another year.
Like the people of my district, I believe the House should have passed a short-term continuing resolution that defunded the presidents amnesty and allowed the new, Republican-led Congress to start with a clean slate in January. Unfortunately, this is not what we got. I will continue fighting for Congress to stop the budget gimmicks and start using its power of the purse to restore fiscal accountability and rein in the presidents overreach. Such a powerful tool must be used far more responsibly.
