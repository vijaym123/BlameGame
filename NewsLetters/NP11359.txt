Dear Friend,
I'm very concerned by the Federal Railroad Administration's recent
report
that condemned Metro-North's safety
culture. I'm particularly troubled by the lack of training and
experience with track inspectors. It's just unacceptable. I'm glad
Metro-North is taking immediate actions to address these issues.
Connecticut commuters deserve safe, reliable train service.
This report also reinforces that there is and has been a dramatic
systematic failure on the part of lawmakers to prioritize investments
in our infrastructure. Budgets reflect our priorities, and there is
blame to be shared by Congress. It's time to boost our investments in
maintaining and improving our rail infrastructure to make sure
Connecticut families have safe, reliable train service.
Continuing the Call for Commonsense Gun Violence Prevention Reforms
I was proud to welcome Team 26, a courageous group of men and women who
biked almost 400 miles from Newtown to Washington, DC, and join with
them in their call on Congress to act to reduce gun violence. They are
parents whose children attend or attended Sandy Hook Elementary School
and people who lost loved ones to gun violence. Check out this
Washington Post video on their arrival:
What's happening around Connecticut's 5th District
Last night, I had the honor of welcoming home Connecticut National
Guard units who served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan,
including the 143rd Combat Sustainment Support Battalion in Waterbury.
These men and women and their families have sacrificed so much
defending our freedom.
And earlier this week, I delivered "Meals on Wheels" to seniors in
Farmington. I saw firsthand how critical this program is to making sure
folks get fresh, nutritional meals. I've been working to protect
federal funding for "Meals on Wheels" because it's wrong to balance the
budget on the backs of our neighbors in need.
You can check out more pictures from these and other events on my
official Facebook page
. As always, please don't hesitate to reach out by email
or at 860-223-8412. I look forward to hearing
from you.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Esty
