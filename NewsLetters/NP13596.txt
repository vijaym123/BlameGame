Heller Announces Opposition to Budget
Deal
(Washington, D.C.)
Last
week, U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV)
announced his opposition to the latest
budget deal.
"After carefully reviewing the latest
budget deal and listening to
Nevadans concerns about our
government's spending problems, I cannot
support this legislation. While I applaud
the efforts of Representative Ryan and
Senator Murray, yet again, Congress has
been handed another short-term deal that
does absolutely nothing to tackle our
long-term debt, or place our nation on
sound fiscal footing, said Senator
Dean Heller.
In addition, I
strongly agree with Representative Joe
Heck. Rather than relying on our veterans
to pay for increased spending, Congress
needs to make sacrifices all across the
board. Our heroes have served this nation
bravely, and do not deserve to have their
benefits compromised in any way. It is my
hope that Washington can get serious about
crafting a long-term solution to address
our nations growing spending
addiction and get Americans back to
work.
