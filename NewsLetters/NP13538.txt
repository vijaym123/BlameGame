Why is it that spending always seems to win in any government?
Jefferson warned two hundred years ago that the normal course of things
was for government to gain ground and for liberty to yield, and
unfortunately yesterday's Ryan-Murray budget deal was another data
point in support of our third President's hypothesis. I voted against
the deal because it raised spending while shattering Washington's only
current platform for financial constraint.
This is not to say that its authors weren't trying to fix a problem,
they were and I applaud them. They even had some steps toward reining
in spending that suggested important bipartisan compromise. It is just
that their fix will prove most expensive for us as taxpayers.
Leaving spending aside for one moment, I have been struck since
returning to Congress, after a 13 year absence, with the disappearance
of the budget process in our nation's Capitol. What were once yearly
debates on each of the 12 categories of government spending, have now
devolved to the point that the operations of our government are run on
automatic pilot. In Washington they are called "Continuing Resolutions"
and they simply fund the portions of government under Congress's yearly
oversight as they were funded the year before. It's bad for the
taxpayer and disastrous for the aspects of government that we fund
because it neither rewards, nor penalizes, the parts of government that
do and don't work.
The question we had to ask in this debate was should a return to the
correct budget process in Washington cost $63 billion? More precisely
the question is should we spend $63 billion for the promise of going
back to that process for the guarantee of just a year, or if we were
lucky 24 months?
Even if we got a return to the normal budget process in Washington, the
bill still had glaring deficiencies in raising spending and adding yet
a bit more in taxes.
On spending it did what Washington always does, increase it now and
promise to pay it back later. So the $63 billion of new spending comes
overwhelmingly in the first year, and the promise to repay comes
overwhelmingly after ten years. It means the deficit would go up by $41
billion in just the next 24 months. Even more frightening was that
minutes after we took the vote, the deal began to prove anything but
binding. We won't have to wait for ten years to see if Congress will
abide by the new spending limits; they were broken within ten minutes!
It's ridiculously hard to believe, but literally the next vote we took
after the budget deal was the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act.
It overwhelmingly passed and authorized spending levels for defense at
$31.6 billion higher than the cap in the Ryan-Murray budget deal.
So let's think about this. Congress passes a law to hold the line on
spending. This bill on Thursday breaks that law for a new deal that
will hold the line on spending, and within about ten minutes Congress
has already laid the course for breaking that law.
As if all this were not enough, this bill would raise taxes. They are
not called taxes, but if it involves money leaving my wallet and
heading to Washington, it's sure a first cousin. In this case the fees
we pay to fly will be going up.
We might have passed the "clean" Continuing Resolution the President,
and House and Senate Democrats were calling for a month ago, and taken
some time to consider all these things. Sometimes no deal is the better
deal, and Thursday night it struck me that there was something to what
Jefferson articulated. At minimum, hanging onto any spending restraint
one can find in Washington is important, because the only budget you
can count on is this year's.

Why
is
it
that
spending
always
seems
to
win
in
any
government?
Jefferson
warned
two
hundred
years
ago
that
the
normal
course
of
things
was
for
government
to
gain
ground
and
for
liberty
to
yield,
and
unfortunately
yesterday&#8217;s
Ryan-Murray
budget
deal
was
another
data
point
in
support
of
our
third
President&#8217;s
hypothesis.
I
voted
against
the
deal
because
it
raised
spending
while
shattering
Washington&#8217;s
only
current
platform
for
financial
constraint.
This
is
not
to
say
that
its
authors
weren&#8217;t
trying
to
fix
a
problem,
they
were
and
I
applaud
them.
They
even
had
some
steps
toward
reining
in
spending
that
suggested
important
bipartisan
compromise.
It
is
just
that
their
fix
will
prove
most
expensive
for
us
as
taxpayers.
Leaving
spending
aside
for
one
moment,
I
have
been
struck
since
returning
to
Congress,
after
a
13
year
absence,
with
the
disappearance
of
the
budget
process
in
our
nation&#8217;s
Capitol.
What
were
once
yearly
debates
on
each
of
the
12
categories
of
government
spending,
have
now
devolved
to
the
point
that
the
operations
of
our
government
are
run
on
automatic
pilot.
In
Washington
they
are
called
&#8220;Continuing
Resolutions&#8221;
and
they
simply
fund
the
portions
of
government
under
Congress&#8217;s
yearly
oversight
as
they
were
funded
the
year
before.
It&#8217;s
bad
for
the
taxpayer
and
disastrous
for
the
aspects
of
government
that
we
fund
because
it
neither
rewards,
nor
penalizes,
the
parts
of
government
that
do
and
don&#8217;t
work.
The
question
we
had
to
ask
in
this
debate
was
should
a
return
to
the
correct
budget
process
in
Washington
cost
$63
billion?
More
precisely
the
question
is
should
we
spend
$63
billion
for
the
promise
of
going
back
to
that
process
for
the
guarantee
of
just
a
year,
or
if
we
were
lucky
24
months?
Even
if
we
got
a
return
to
the
normal
budget
process
in
Washington,
the
bill
still
had
glaring
deficiencies
in
raising
spending
and
adding
yet
a
bit
more
in
taxes.
On
spending
it
did
what
Washington
always
does,
increase
it
now
and
promise
to
pay
it
back
later.
So
the
$63
billion
of
new
spending
comes
overwhelmingly
in
the
first
year,
and
the
promise
to
repay
comes
overwhelmingly
after
ten
years.
It
means
the
deficit
would
go
up
by
$41
billion
in
just
the
next
24
months.
Even
more
frightening
was
that
minutes
after
we
took
the
vote,
the
deal
began
to
prove
anything
but
binding.
We
won&#8217;t
have
to
wait
for
ten
years
to
see
if
Congress
will
abide
by
the
new
spending
limits;
they
were
broken
within
ten
minutes!
It&#8217;s
ridiculously
hard
to
believe,
but
literally
the
next
vote
we
took
after
the
budget
deal
was
the
2014
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
It
overwhelmingly
passed
and
authorized
spending
levels
for
defense
at
$31.6
billion
higher
than
the
cap
in
the
Ryan-Murray
budget
deal.
So
let&#8217;s
think
about
this.
Congress
passes
a
law
to
hold
the
line
on
spending.
This
bill
on
Thursday
breaks
that
law
for
a
new
deal
that
will
hold
the
line
on
spending,
and
within
about
ten
minutes
Congress
has
already
laid
the
course
for
breaking
that
law.
As
if
all
this
were
not
enough,
this
bill
would
raise
taxes.
They
are
not
called
taxes,
but
if
it
involves
money
leaving
my
wallet
and
heading
to
Washington,
it&#8217;s
sure
a
first
cousin.
In
this
case
the
fees
we
pay
to
fly
will
be
going
up.
We
might
have
passed
the
&#8220;clean&#8221;
Continuing
Resolution
the
President,
and
House
and
Senate
Democrats
were
calling
for
a
month
ago,
and
taken
some
time
to
consider
all
these
things.
Sometimes
no
deal
is
the
better
deal,
and
Thursday
night
it
struck
me
that
there
was
something
to
what
Jefferson
articulated.
At
minimum,
hanging
onto
any
spending
restraint
one
can
find
in
Washington
is
important,
because
the
only
budget
you
can
count
on
is
this
year&#8217;s.
