Congressman
Lamborn has spoken with House Leadership, the relevant Committee
Chairman, has encouraged dozens of his colleagues to sign on in support of the
Cruz/Lamborn legislation, and is hopeful of expedited passage of the
legislation through the House this week.
"There is broad
bi-cameral and bi-partisan support for this type of legislation. Preventing
terrorists from gaining free passage into our country should be a
priority for every member of Congress,"
said Congressman Lamborn.
The Congressman's office will be
keeping you posted on the House progress of this legislation throughout
the week.
