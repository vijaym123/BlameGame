Dear Friends,
With the forecast this week inching toward 60 degrees, it appears that
winter has finally broken. The promise of warmer weather and longer
days has me itching for summer - eating outdoors at my favorite
waterfront restaurants and spending time outside with family and
friends. I'm sure you feel the same; after the winter we've had in
Rhode Island, we deserve some sunshine.
This is also a busy time of year for many families, with the school
year winding down and weekends jam packed with activities. As you begin
to plan your April break or your summer getaway, I wanted to remind you
that my office is here to help facilitate your visit to Washington,
D.C.
It is a beautiful time of year in our nation's capital. The National
Park Service estimates that the peak bloom of Washington's signature
cherry blossom trees will be from April 8 to 12
. The warmer weather is more
conducive to the many walking destinations in the city, as well. My
website gives a brief overview of some of the must-see D.C.
destinations
, from the Supreme Court and
the Library of Congress to the National Cathedral. My office can
personally provide a tour of the Capitol, courtesy of my newest staff
member, Sam Chasin. We can also help you arrange a White House tour. I
advise you to put your bid in early
, as tours are scheduled on a
first come, first served basis, and must be done at least 21 days in
advance.
I am so lucky that my work takes me to two of the most beautiful places
in our country - Rhode Island and Washington. If you have never been to
D.C., I strongly urge you to add it to your bucket list. It is an
incredible city filled with history and excitement, and I am confident
you and your family will love it.
To learn more about how my office can help you, visit my website

Call to Action
Immigration reform is about providing a path to citizenship for people
who want to make this country better. It is about bringing undocumented
immigrants into our system so we know who is here and can ensure they
follow the rules. It is about making smart financial choices. And it is
about doing the right thing. The Senate passed a strong, bipartisan
reform bill, and now it is up to the House to bring this issue to a
vote. I signed the discharge petition because regardless of the
outcome, immigration reform is an issue that constituents deserve to
know our positions on.

Flood Relief Reality
After a 306-91 vote in the House, the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act passed the Senate, bringing relief to the many
coastal property owners in Rhode Island who faced skyrocketing costs in
flood insurance. This bipartisan compromise refunds excess charges
already paid, reinstates the "grandfathering" process and makes costs
more predictable.

Dear

With

you
feel

we
deserve
some
sunshine.
