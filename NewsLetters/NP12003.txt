Stopping the IRS Persecution of Conservatives
Dear Friends,
Before the elections of 2012, the IRS deliberately targeted individual conservative groups and barred them from obtaining tax-exempt status.
Our first amendment rights are too important to allow anyone to undermine them.
As a member of Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I continue to investigate the IRS in regard to this scandalous abuse of power and look to hold those responsible accountable.
As part of this ongoing effort, I joined a bipartisan majority in the House this week to pass H.R. 3865: the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014, legislation which I also co-sponsored.
This bill delays changes to IRS rules proposed in November to increase restrictions on tax-exempt organizations.
These new restrictions would not affect unions, only 501(c)(4)s.
We need to get the IRS out of the business of telling American citizens what their political views should be, and especially stop them from silencing Americans if
they disagree.
I will continue to doggedly fight for the truth behind the administrations many scandals.
Please dont hesitate to
contact me
with your thoughts and concerns.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
