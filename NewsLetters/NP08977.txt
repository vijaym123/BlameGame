If you had the chance to cut government waste... The federal government has dozens of programs that are
duplicative, wasteful, or just ineffective. I've introduced legislation you
can read about below that will make it easier to get rid of them. Here
are just a few examples. Which of these would you choose first? I would
eliminate: The Denali Commission that was
meant to promote rural Alaskan development, but its own leadership
says it's "run its course" The National Technical Information Service, which sells government

Did you answer the question
above?
Cutting government waste should be that simple, but for too
long, it hasn't been.
Believe it or not, there are a
lot of government programs out there that both Democrats and Republicans
agree we can live without.
But for different reasons, they hang
on year after year.
I just introduced
HR 4566 to establish the Commission on the
Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA)
to
make it easier to identify those programs and get them off the
taxpayers' bill quicker. If you're interested, you can read the actual text
of that bill
here .
Finding ways to get government spending under
control is an effort for all of us.
I would be very interested to
hear
your thoughts and
ideas , and I hope you'd like to stay in touch on this issue or
any others that are important to you.
