Dear Friend,
It was a great
honor to be with my congressional colleagues in South Africa, among the
tens of thousands -- presidents, prime ministers, royals, celebrities
and people all over the world -- who gathered to bid farewell to the
great Nelson Mandela. While he is no longer with us, he will never be
forgotten.
Budget Deal :
Upon my return from South Africa, on Thursday I voted for a budget
that prevents a government shutdown for the next two years and does not
make any cuts to essential programs like Social Security and Medicare.
However it is abominable that despite our plea, the House Republican
Leadership refused to allow a vote on the extension of federal
unemployment insurance (UI) before the December 28th deadline. Because
Congress adjourned without renewing the UI, 127,100 unemployed workers in New
York will lose benefits on December 28, 2013. And an additional
132,800 unemployed workers will lose their benefits in the first six month
of 2014. If you require assistance, please contact my
office.
Do-Nothing GOP Congress:
The
first year of the Republican 113th Congress has drawn to a close, and
after one of the most miserably unproductive records in the history of
Congress, the GOP sent everyone home a day early. Last week, Speaker
Boehner offered this assessment of his do-nothing GOP record: Weve done
our work. To that i say: Not on comprehensive immigration
reform.
Not on sensible background checks for gun purchases.
Not on
ending discrimination in the workplace. Not on extending critical
unemployment insurance.
Not on standing up for hard-working American
families by raising the minimum wage.
And certainly not on
creating jobs.
The fact is that House
Republicans have done nothing but waste a
year of the American peoples
time consistently obstructing the priorities of the American people
to pander to the most reckless and irresponsible elements of their
conference. There is still much work to do: we need to extend
unemployment insurance for the thousands of Americans who are still looking for
work and we need to close the multi-billion-dollar tax loopholes that
are contributing to the federal deficit without helping hard-working
taxpayers. Though I am disappointed that these issues were not
addressed, you know that I will be fighting for them as soon as we return in
January.

YOUR TRIBUTE
TO NELSON MANDELA ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE:
It's still
not late to share your thoughts
here...
Among 23 Members of
Congress in South Africa -- I was deeply honored to be part of a
congressional delegation that went to South Africa to bid Madiba farewell as he
laid to rest .
God spent a lot of time making Nelson Mandela and I am just so proud
that I was on this planet in time to meet him.
LEGISLATIVE
SPOTLIGHT
I voted YES for the
House Amendment to
H. J. Res. 59 Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013,
which
would replace a portion of the across-the-board sequester that has
harmed students, seniors, and middle-class families and has served as a
drag on the Nation's economy over the last year.
It would
allow for critical investments in areas such as education,
infrastructure, and scientific research, while keeping us on the path to
long-term deficit reduction.
