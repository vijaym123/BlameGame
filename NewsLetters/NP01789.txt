OUR DISTRICT
April 03, 2015
Friend,
Only 24 hours
remain before voting closes in our annual
Congressional Art Competition , which gives all 10th
district high school students the opportunity to submit their original
artwork to hang on the walls of the U.S. Capitol
building.
Have you
voted?
Voting closes at MIDNIGHT TOMORROW, and
so far, it's a close race.
Cast
your vote by clicking "Like" on your favorite piece
here .
At midnight tomorrow, whichever piece has the most
"Likes" will win.
The first place winner will have his or
her artwork sent to Washington, D.C. where it will be displayed for
the next year in the national exhibition in the Cannon Tunnel, a
pedestrian walkway leading to the United States
Capitol.
Additionally, a scholarship may also be offered to the winner to fly to
Washington, D.C. for the reception and announcement of the National
Winner. Second and third place winners will have the opportunity to display
their art in my Modesto district office.
