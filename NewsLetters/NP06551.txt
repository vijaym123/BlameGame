2014 Border Conference
Dear Friend,
I would like to cordially invite you to the 2014 Border Conference on September 12, 2014, presented by my office and the Border Legislative Conference.
We will be joined by a Congressional delegation from the northern and southern border; mayors from three states and two countries; a senior Administration Commerce official; and policy and business leaders from the U.S. and Mexico. I want you to be there to get their expertise and share yours on how we make the most of our strategic position as the worlds largest bi-national community, looking at issues of trade, commerce, mobility and education.
To register and see a list of speakers please visit:

Sincerely,
Beto O'Rourke
Member of Congress
