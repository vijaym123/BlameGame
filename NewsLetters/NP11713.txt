Statement on the President's 2015 Budget
Proposal
3/4/14
In response to President Obama's proposed 2015
Budget package (including the Department of Defense Budget), Congressman
Doug Lamborn has released the following
statement:
Today, details have been released on the
proposed DOD Budget. Our national security should not be a budgetary
punching bag. It has been the only part of the federal government that
has been seriously cut over the last few years. Its one thing to go
back to pre-9/11 force levels, but there is no justification for going
back to pre-World War II levels.
Instead, the rest of the runaway spending of the federal
government needs to take some cuts. A perfect example is todays
lame-duck budget proposal from President Obama calling for: $8.3 trillion
dollars added to the debt over the next 10 years, $651 billion dollars
in new taxes, $56 billion dollars in new so-called stimulus spending,
and full funding for the failure that is
Obamacare.
"We live in a dangerous world with
constantly changing threats. Russia and China have both added military
spending in recent years. Sadly, during President Obamas time in
office, we have seen $1.2 trillion dollars in defense cuts. This is not the
time for weak leadership and a weak military. It is unrealistic and
wrongheaded to make the men and women in uniform bear the brunt of
attempting to balance the budget. Our defense budget is an investment in
the security of this nation, and that is not a responsibility to be
taken lightly. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs will be presenting to the House Armed Services Committee on March
6 th , and I look forward to presenting them with serious
questions on this budget proposal.
