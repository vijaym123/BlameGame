28th
District
Dear
Friend,
Once again it is my pleasure to announce online voting for the 28th
District annual Congressional Art Competitions Peoples Choice
Award! The Congressional Art Competition is a decades long tradition in
Congress meant to encourage and recognize the rich talent of young
artists throughout the United States.
Each year, high school
students from the 28th Congressional District submit art pieces that, if
selected, will hang in the United States Capitol, my Washington, DC
Office, or my Burbank District Office for one year.
I will display
the winner of the Peoples Choice award in my Hollywood District
Office. This year we have 61 student participants and 64 works of art in
the competition from District 28.

HERE
to vote for your favorite piece!
The winners of the contest will be
announced at the 28th Congressional District High School Art
Competition Forum &amp; Exhibit on Sunday, April 26, 2015. All student
participants will receive a Congressional Certificate of Recognition. The
exhibit will be held at Descanso Gardens in La Caada Flintridge at Van de
Kamp Hall. Parking and admission to Van de Kamp Hall are free. Exhibit
viewing will being at 3:00 pm and the Forum and Awards Presentation
