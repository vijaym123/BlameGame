Advocating for Improvements in Veterans' Health Care
Hi All!
I hope you all had a wonderful week.
I spent last week fighting for
our nation's veterans and discussing immigration reform with business
leaders in Nashua.
Pushing for Progress in Veterans' Health Care
Last Wednesday, I participated in a House Veterans' Affairs Health
Subcommittee hearing to advocate on behalf of New Hampshire veterans.
The hearing was held to address efforts to fix deficiencies in VA care,
and featured testimony from the VA's Under Secretary of Health Robert
Petzel. During the hearing, I asked for a progress update on how the VA
is working to address delays in modernizing its medical technology.
Earlier this year, I visited one of New Hampshire's leading medical
device companies, Gamma Medica, and heard from the company about the
nearly two-year delays the VA was experiencing in procuring early
detection breast cancer screening devices. During my visit to the
company, I learned about how these devices can help provide crucial
preventative screening for veterans
. At the hearing, I stressed the
need for ensuring veterans have access to this kind of potentially
life-saving technology.
Our nation's veterans rely on the VA to provide them with the
high-quality health care services they deserve after courageously
serving to protect our nation.
It is unacceptable that the VA is
experiencing up to two-year delays in procuring modern technology, like
devices to measure tissue density and provide early detection of breast
cancer. I was pleased to hear during the hearing that the VA has
recognized this issue and is working to fix these delays, and I will
continue to monitor their progress very closely moving forward.
At the roundtable in Nashua
Discussing Comprehensive Immigration Reform in Nashua
Last Monday, I convened a roundtable discussion about how modernizing
the immigration system can bolster America's innovation economy. During
the roundtable, I met with Nashua business leaders to discuss the need
for an immigration system that attracts highly skilled workers from
around the world, and the importance of allowing foreign-born students
educated in the USA to grow businesses and create jobs here in America
instead of taking their businesses abroad.
I am committed to providing America's students and next generation of
workers with the skills they need to compete and win in the 21st
Century job market, and will continue working to expand investments in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education
programs.
Conveying NH Veterans' Concerns to VA Secretary Eric Shinseki
Last Thursday, I held a breakfast meeting with Secretary of Veterans
Affairs Eric Shinseki to share with him the most pressing concerns of
New Hampshire veterans. As a member of the U.S. House Veterans' Affairs
Committee, I have traveled throughout the second district to hear from
the veteran community and am committed to advocating on their behalf in
Washington. New Hampshire's veterans made great personal sacrifices to
serve and protect this nation, and we must ensure they always have
access to the support and care they rightfully deserve. I shared with
Secretary Shinseki the concerns I've heard from veterans in my
district, many of whom have faced unbelievable obstacles in receiving
high-quality care from the VA. No veteran should ever go without the
care they need, and I urged the Secretary to immediately address their
concerns.
The topics I urged Secretary Shinseki to consider included: the need to
improve access to health care services for rural veterans by
implementing expanded contract services and tele-health medicine; the
importance of eliminating the backlog in claims at the VA and
coordinating with the Department of Defense on electronic treatment
records; support for better workforce and education training programs
to help veterans transition to civilian life and land well-paying jobs;
and questions about what the VA is doing to better screen and provide
effective treatment for survivors of military sexual trauma.
I also
discussed a bill I introduced last year with Congresswoman Jackie
Walorski (IN-02) to provide travel benefits for survivors of military
sexual trauma seeking specialized treatment at VA facilities.
I was encouraged by Secretary Shinseki's update on the VA's work to
eliminate its backlog in claims. In particular, the Secretary informed
me that there has been a 35 percent drop last year in claims backlog
since the VA began to work towards receiving automated electronic
treatment records directly from the Department of Defense. However, the
number of claims that remain trapped in the process is still
unacceptable, and I urged the Secretary to continue to make modernizing
the VA's system a number one priority.
Have a fantastic weekend and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Conveying

Veterans&#8217;
Concerns
to

Secretary
Eric

Last Thursday,
I
held
a
breakfast
meeting
with
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
Eric
Shinseki
to
share
with
him
the
most
pressing
concerns
of
New

veterans. As
a
member
of
the
U.S.
House
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee,
I
have
traveled
throughout
the
second
district
to
hear
from
the
veteran
community
and
am
committed
to
advocating
on
their
behalf
in
Washington. New
Hampshire&#8217;s
veterans
made
great
personal
sacrifices
to
serve
and
protect
this
nation,
and
we
must
ensure
they
always
have
access
to
the
support
and
care
they
rightfully
deserve. I
shared
with
Secretary
Shinseki
the
concerns
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
veterans
in
my
district,
many
of
whom
have
faced
unbelievable

in
receiving
high-quality

No
veteran
should
ever
go
without
the
care
they
need,
and
I
urged
the
Secretary
to
immediately
address
their
concerns.
The
topics
I
urged
Secretary
Shinseki
to

included:
the
need
to
improve
access
to
health

the
importance
of
eliminating
the
backlog

at
the

and
coordinating
with
the
Department
of
Defense
on
electronic
treatment
records;
support
for
better
workforce
and
education
training
programs
to
help
veterans
transition
to
civilian
life
and
land
well-paying
jobs;
and
questions
about
what
the
VA
is
doing
to
better
screen
and
provide
effective
treatment
for
survivors
of
military
sexual
trauma.
I
also
discussed
a
bill
I
introduced
last

with
Congresswoman
Jackie
Walorski
(IN-02)
to
provide
travel
benefits
for
survivors

I
was
encouraged
by
Secretary
Shinseki&#8217;s
update
on
the
VA&#8217;s
work
to
eliminate
its
backlog
in
claims. In
particular,
the
Secretary
informed
me
that
there
has
been
a
35
percent
drop
last
year
in
claims
backlog
since
the
VA
began
to
work
towards
receiving

directly
from
the

the
number
of
claims
that
remain

in
the
process
is
still
unacceptable,
and
I
urged
the
Secretary
to
continue
to
make
modernizing
the
VA&#8217;s
system
a
number
one
priority.
Have
a
fantastic
