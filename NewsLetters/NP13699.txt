House Budget Blueprint Lends Certainty to Appropriations Process
In a vote that paves the way for the House Appropriations Committee to
craft legislation to fund government operations, I supported passage of
the bipartisan budget agreement that House and Senate Budget Committee
Chairs had announced earlier in the week.
The blueprint sets top-line budget levels for 2014 and 2015, restores
over $31 billion to the Department of Defense, helps avoid another
government shutdown, does not rely on tax hikes, and reduces the
deficit by $23 billion more than the devastating cuts of sequestration.
While the plan does not please everyone, the appropriations process can
now move forward to fulfilling its duty of creating
fiscally-responsible appropriations bills that fund every agency of the
federal government.
Lurching from one budget crisis to another is no way to do business,
and this framework adds some welcome certainty the equation.
During these budget negotiations, my commitment to our national
security did not waver. I will not stand idly by and allow our military
to be stripped of the resources it needs to protect us at home and
around the globe.
Anti-Malaria Efforts Make Historical Difference
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 2000 and
2012, estimated malaria mortality rates fell by 45% in all age groups
and by 51% in children under five years of age - enormous progress in
the fight against this mosquito-borne disease.
I was on hand at a Capitol Hill reception on Wednesday to recognize the
WHO World Malaria Report and the work of Malaria No More, an
organization whose central goal matches its name.
As the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Malaria and Neglected
Tropical Diseases, I am proud that the United States provides about one
quarter of the total global funding for malaria prevention and
treatment worldwide. There's a lot of work ahead, but it's clear that
progress is being made against the ravages of this disease.

reception on Wednesday evening.
