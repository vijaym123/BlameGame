After graduating from medical school, I had the honor of serving as a
physician at a VA clinic. In doing so, I experienced first-hand just
how selfless and how honorable our veterans are. Their level of
patriotism and willingness to sacrifice for the future of this great
nation deserves our most heartfelt praise and gratitude. They truly
embody the very best our country has to offer.
In order to honor the soldiers who died protecting our freedoms, the
very least we can do is to keep the promises we made to their brothers
and sisters in arms. That means ensuring our VA system is functional
and efficient so that veterans are getting the care they need and
deserve. It means ensuring there are programs in place to help
returning veterans reintegrate back to civilian life. And it means
creating an economic environment where our veterans can find good
paying jobs.
Our veterans ran towards danger so that the rest of us may live in
safety. Many of them lost their lives in doing so. On this Memorial Day
let us renew our commitment to those who have worn the uniform of the
United States military that we will always have their back, just like
they had ours. Finally, let us pray for the safe return of those who
are still serving in danger abroad and for the families of those who
have lost a loved one while serving our country.

After
graduating
from
medical
school,
I
had
the
honor
of
serving
as
a
physician
at
a
VA
clinic.
In
doing
so,
I
experienced
first-hand
just
how
selfless
and
how
honorable
our
veterans
are.
Their
level
of
patriotism
and
willingness
to
sacrifice
for
the
future
of
this
great
nation
deserves
our
most
heartfelt
praise
and
gratitude.
They
truly
embody
the
very
best
our
country
has
to
offer.
In
order
to
honor
the
soldiers
who
died
protecting
our
freedoms,
the
very
least
we
can
do
is
to
keep
the
promises
we
made
to
their
brothers
and
sisters
in
arms.
That
means
ensuring
our
VA
system
is
functional
and
efficient
so
that
veterans
are
getting
the
care
they
need
and
deserve.
It
means
ensuring
there
are
programs
in
place
to
help
returning
veterans
reintegrate
back
to
civilian
life.
And
it
means
creating
an
economic
environment
where
our
veterans
can
find
good
paying
jobs.
Our
veterans
ran
towards
danger
so
that
the
rest
of
us
may
live
in
safety.
Many
of
them
lost
their
lives
in
doing
so.
On
this
Memorial
Day
let
us
renew
our
commitment
to
those
who
have
worn
the
uniform
of
the
United
States
military
that
we
will
always
have
their
back,
just
like
they
had
ours.
Finally,
let
us
pray
for
the
safe
return
of
those
who
are
still
serving
in
danger
abroad
and
for
the
families
of
those
who
have
lost
a
loved
one
while
serving
our
country.
