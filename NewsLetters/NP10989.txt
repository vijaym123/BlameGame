Tuesday in East Grand Forks
Dear Friends,
This week our Minnesota weather gave us tornados and snowstorms as we ushered in the month of April. We had another busy week in Washington, D.C. On Thursday the House Agriculture Committee heard testimony from Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on the state of the rural economy. Warroad-based Marvin Windows, ELCA Bishop Lawrence Wohlrabe of the NW Minnesota Synod, the MN Pork Producers Association, the Minnesota-South Dakota Equipment Dealers Association and
Rural Minnesota CEP stopped by for a visit. I also met with High School students, an award-winning Assistant Principal, and a former MN State Senator.
Sincerely,

Status of Rural Economy
[http://d1435t697bgi2o.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wheat-harvest.jpg]
On Thursday the House Agriculture Committee heard testimony from Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on the state of the rural economy. The rural economic outlook remains positive in many parts of the country, even as commodity markets are starting to decline and weather challenges persist.
Of course now, we need to make sure we don't do anything to screw this up. People who don't understand agriculture and are driven more by political ideology are the biggest threats to the rural economy. The Ryan budget proposes an additional $23 billion in cuts to the farm safety net and turns SNAP into a block grant while the EPA at times seems intent on regulating farmers out of business.
Having a new farm bill is good for the rural economy. Providing farmers with at least five years of certainty allows them to make long-term planning decisions. The farm bill's rural development, research and energy programs all benefit local communities and the 16 million American jobs tied to agriculture.
Getting the farm bill passed was almost a miracle. Hopefully, implementation will be a lot easier. There are several complicated programs but I have confidence that USDA and Secretary Vilsack are up to the task.

I met with Marvin Windows and other members of the Windows and Door Manufacturers Association on Tuesday. We discussed EPA's energy efficiency and lead regulations. The Window & Door Manufacturers Association define the standards of excellence in the residential and commercial window, door, and skylight industry and advances these standards among industry members while providing resources, education, and professional programs designed to advance industry businesses.

I met with Bishop Lawrence Wohlrabe of the Northwestern Minnesota Synod, Bishop James Dunlop of the Lower Susquehanna Synod, and Mikka McCracken with Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) World Hunger. Thirty-two bishops representing 65 synods of the ELCA were on Capitol Hill to voice support for public policy that creates opportunities to overcome poverty and protect the environment.
The ELCA is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S. with approximately four million members.
The Northwestern Minnesota Synod includes 21 counties in northwestern Minnesota.

Minnesota Pork Producers Association visited with me about trade, research and disaster funding, and other issues important to the industry.
Minnesota ranks second in the number of hogs raised and the value of hogs sold for processing, according to 2011 National Pork Board statistics.
Additionally, Minnesota pork producers benefit from the close proximity of two major Minnesota pork processing plants:
Hormel Foods (Austin) and JBS (Worthington).

On Thursday I sat down with the Minnesota-South Dakota Equipment Dealers Association (EDA) to discuss farm bill implementation, trade, tax policy, and other issues that affect equipment dealers.
According to its mission statement, EDA seeks to build the best business environment it can for Minnesota and South Dakota equipment dealers.
The current association formed in 1963 when the two state associations merged to serve the needs of area equipment dealers. However, the history of each can be traced back as early as 1888 in Minnesota and 1899 in South Dakota.

This week I met with representatives from the Rural Minnesota CEP to discuss funding for work training programs that have become a vital part in fulfilling jobs in Western Minnesota. Hard working programs like these are enabling young and old workers alike to continue training and better themselves for expanding careers opportunities in the 7th District. I commend these folks on their hard work and success for rural Minnesota's working communities.

Hawley and Breckenridge High Schools

I spent time this week with Junior and Senior students from Hawley High School and Breckenridge High School as part of the Close Up Foundation's program of bringing students from across the country to visit Washington, meet with lawmakers, and tour the Nation's Capital. I always enjoy meeting Minnesota's youth and seeing the promising futures that lie ahead of them. After getting a better understanding of what happens on a daily basis in Congress, we were given the opportunity to have more casual conversation and learn about the student's futures. I look forward to the hard work these students will contribute to western Minnesota.

We had a thorough discussion on the current state of shooting sports in America. These men are on the front lines of gun safety, with manufacturers taking the right steps in providing gun locks through their CHILDSAFE program while raising awareness to the issues and efficiently working with federal agencies.

Month of the Military Child
On Monday Governor Mark Dayton proclaimed April as Month of the Military Child. When a parent serves overseas children have to make enormous sacrifices too. Honoring and recognizing military children will go a long way for them. Communities can also do their part by wearing purple and attending "Purple Up! Day," which is an event for military kids which takes place on April 15th in the State Capitol Rotunda in St. Paul.
