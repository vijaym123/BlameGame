The House
Budget Plan Will Prevent a Fiscal
Crisis
Dear Friend,
For far too long, the people of
Virginias Fifth District have been
negatively impacted by Washingtons
inability to live within its means. This
lack of fiscal discipline has created
economic uncertainty and prevented more
dynamic job growth from occurring. It is
high time we put an end to business as
usual in Washington and stop spending money
the federal government does not have.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office (CBO)
has
updated its projections and analysis
of
our annual deficits for the next ten years
and their impact on our national debt. It
now expects that we will run a $486 billion
deficit in fiscal year 2015. While this is
lower than the deficits of $1 trillion or
more we ran a few years ago, it is still
unacceptable and a serious threat to our
future. CBO projects the cumulative
deficits over the next ten years to add
$7.2 trillion to our national debt that
already stands at a staggering $18.1
trillion and counting.
Last month, President Obama released his
budget proposal for the next fiscal year
and beyond, which could have been an
opportunity to address these debt and
deficit challenges. Unfortunately, his
proposal demonstrates that he wants to
continue with the same policies that
generated
more
than $7.5 trillion in new debt
during
his six years in office.
The
CBO finds that his budget never
ever
balances
and would drive
our national debt up to more than
$26
trillion by 2025 , as total spending is
expected to increase by 65 percent over ten
years under his plan.
Now that we have evaluated the
Presidents budget proposal, the
House and Senate will propose their own
budgets, which will offer a sharp contrast
from the increased taxes and spending the
President seeks. The House Budget Committee
is expected to consider a budget proposal
this week with the possibility of
consideration by the full House taking
place the following week.
Just like our previous budgets, I fully
expect that the House Budget will include
responsible spending reforms to balance the
budget and begin the process of paying down
our debt. It will also include policies to
expand opportunity by growing the economy,
providing families with a fair, simple tax
code to boost wages and create jobs, and
restoring fairness by cutting spending and
combating cronyism. We must make it easier
for our small businesses to create the jobs
our local communities need, not harder
and now is the time to adopt a
pro-growth budget that will create the
certainty they need.
I look forward to the House of
Representatives once again leading the way
by passing a pro-growth budget. I remain
committed to working with my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to make the tough
decisions necessary to balance our budget
and get our fiscal house in order so that
we can grow our economy and build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
