I love the holidays
because I get the opportunity
to spend time with friends
and family and catch up with
the people I love. This time
of year also gives me time to
reflect on my life, both
personally and
professionally, and challenge
myself to exceed the high
standards hardworking
Delawareans rightly set for
me each day.
This reflection reminds
me, though, that many folks
dont have the
opportunity to reunite with
loved ones during the holiday
season. Our brave men and
women in uniform stationed
around the world will spend
the holidays away from
family.I am also
reminded of those who are
less fortunate and may not
have the chance to sit by a
warm fire this winter. I hope
everyone will keep these
people in their thoughts and
lend a helping hand when
possible.
As we look to the New
Year, lets come
together and do what we can
to make hope shine even
brighter for Delawareans,
folks across the country, and
all around the world this
holiday season.
Happy Holidays and God
Bless,
