Dear Friend,
This week, I introduced the Establishing
Beneficiary Equity in the Hospital
Readmission Program Act with my colleague,
Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY). This bipartisan,
commonsense legislation protects
Americas most vulnerable patients by
leveling the playing field for
Americas hospitals through an
adjustment to the Hospital Readmission
Reduction Program (HRRP).
The HRRP was created under the
presidents health care law to reduce
acute care hospital readmissions. It
requires the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) to penalize
hospitals based on the last three years of
a hospitals readmission data
compared to the national average. While
well-intentioned, HRRP does not account for
socio-economic factors that often have an
equally substantial impact on readmission
rates. Therefore, it disproportionately
penalizes hospitals throughout the country
that treat our nations most
disadvantaged population.
Our countrys poorest populations
have fewer community resources available to
prevent readmissions, such as access to
primary care, mental health services,
rehabilitative care, and their prescribed
medications and food. Therefore, hospitals
caring for these patients are not only more
likely to incur a penalty, they are more
likely to face the maximum penalty under
the program.
As a former businessman with a long
record of experience in the health care
industry,its clear that the
HRRP unfairly penalizes safety-net and
teaching hospitals
taking valuable
resources from those who are in need of
them most. There is no question that this
money could be better spent helping
patients avoid rehospitalization. Our bill
reflects that.
Specifically, the Establishing
Beneficiary Equity in the Hospital
Readmission Program Act requires the
Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) to adjust the readmission penalty
based on a hospitals share of dual
eligible patients, low-income seniors, or
young people with a disability who are
eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. It
also requires CMS to exclude certain
categories of patients whose frequent
hospitalizations are often clinically
necessary or can be attributed to outside
factors or the patients refusal to
comply with their physician recommended
medical treatment.
The legislation is supported by several
hospitals and organizations in Ohio and
around the country including the Cleveland
Clinic, Akron General, MetroHealth, Summa
Health, University Hospitals, Aultman
Health Foundation, American Hospital
Association, Ohio Hospital Association, and
the Association of American Medical
Colleges.
Its critical that the
HRRPs misguided penalty structure is
addressed so that our nations most
vulnerable patients are no longer in
jeopardy. The Establishing Beneficiary
Equity in the Hospital Readmission Program
would do just that, and I look forward to
seeing it move swiftly through the
legislative process.
