Latest on the VA
Scandal
A recent internal audit of VA healthcare
facilities in our area found evidence that employees were directed to falsify
data and manipulate statistics to make waiting times appear shorter
than they truly are. This is in direct contradiction to assurances the
VAs leadership in Philadelphia gave me during visits to these
facilities in recent week. This is just the latest demonstration of the
culture of coverups within the VA bureaucracy, and
I wrote the VA Secretary this week
seeking answers on
how this has happened.
Fighting to
Protect Students on Campus
Last week I introduced
bipartisan legislation that will help protect
victims of sexual assault on college campuse s .
It
strengthens the partnership between schools and law enforcement, enhances
training standards for on-campus personnel, and it will help victims
access confidential advisors who can provide support in the wake of an
assault. Its an important step forward in the effort to protect our
kids on campus and support victims. The legislation includes many of
the recommendations made this year by my Southeastern
Pennsylvania Campus Sexual Violence Advisory
Council.
Passing Bipartisan
Cybersecurity Legislation
As Chair of the House Homeland
Security Committees Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Im pleased that
the House of Representatives has passed groundbreaking cybersecurity
legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support. The legislation, which
I introduced along with Rep. Michael McCaul, was the product of
hundreds of meetings with stakeholders including the private sector and
privacy advocates. The risk of cyber attack in the United States is
growing, and this legislation aims to strengthen our ability to prevent and
respond to cyber attacks while protecting the privacy rights of
law-abiding Americans.
Here
you can see what this law does and how it will protect
Americans.
