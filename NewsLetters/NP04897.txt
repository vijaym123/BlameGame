I&rsquo;m not a political pundit.
So if you&rsquo;re wondering who will control Congress after Tuesday&rsquo;s election, I&rsquo;m the wrong person to ask.
But here&rsquo;s what I do know:
The Republicans have engaged in a concerted war on the poor and middle class.
And who benefits? The Republicans&rsquo; wealthy backers.
And here&rsquo;s the kicker: the beneficiaries of Republicans&rsquo; regressive policies are using their ill-gotten gains to&hellip; you guessed it!... elect even more Republicans.
It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle that rewards the Republicans for handing out more tax breaks to billionaires -- but keeps the minimum wage stagnant, education underfunded, and millions of low-wage workers without Medicaid assistance.
David -- we can fix this. The solution is actually pretty simple.
If we want to tackle income inequality in our country, we need to elect a better Congress. And if we want a better Congress, we need to get-out-the-vote for Democrats who will put the middle-class first. Can you chip in $5 or more today to get-out-the-vote (and kick out the Koch-funded Republicans)?

Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;

Together, we can defeat Republicans who put the interests of billionaires over the common interest.
But my friends at the DCCC need a little help funding their get-out-the-vote program for the final days of this election. If everyone who&rsquo;s reading this email chips in just $5 today, they can hit their goal. David -- can I count you in? https://secure.dccc.org/Chip-In
