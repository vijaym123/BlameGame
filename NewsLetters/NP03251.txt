The United States is a nation built on respect for the rule of
law.
Having borders wherein the rule of law can exist is the
foundation to the nations sovereignty.
Unfortunately, under the
Obama administration, our borders have experienced a breakdown as more
people cross with less border enforcement, undermining law, sovereignty
and security.
We can no longer allow the administration to
turn a blind eye toward our nations broken border.
I am
cosponsoring the
Secure Our Borders First Act
of 2015 (H.R. 399),
which aims to fix the problem. The bill would force the Department of
Homeland Security to achieve operational control of the southern border
in two years in high crossings areas and full control in five
years.
The legislation would require constructing additional fencing
along sections of the southern border, provide Border Patrol access to
federal lands, fund the National Guard on the border, and more to better
secure our nations border.
Securing our border is step
one to solving the nations illegal immigration crisis.
We must
take control of the situation and enforce immigration laws already on
the books, which has not been the case with the Obama
administration.
The
Secure Our Borders First Act
will hold the
administration accountable to carry out its constitutional obligation to execute
the rule of law.
Many in Missouris Seventh District have
reached out to me, saying it is past time to lock down the border and
asking when we are going to take steps to meet the need. With this
bill, the answer is now.
It would move us toward accomplishing the
task and strengthening our nations security and rule of law.
I
am a strong supporter of the
Secure Our Borders First Act
and
will work to see this bill become law.
