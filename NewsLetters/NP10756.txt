Dear Friend,
I don't know if you've heard, but today Republicans in the House of
Representatives passed a budget that would gut Medicare benefits for
our seniors, hurt our hardworking families, and stunt our nation's
economic growth. Unfortunately, it's not the first time they've tried
this.
Under the so-called "Ryan Plan," Medicare would be turned into a
voucher system, leaving our seniors with higher out-of-pocket costs and
diminished access to care. It would raise the Medicare eligibility age
to 67, threatening the financial security and health of Arkansas
seniors who have earned these benefits through a lifetime of hard work.
But that's not all. It would also slash funding for vital services like
long-term care and home-health services and reopen the Medicare Part D
donut hole, causing our seniors to pay more for prescription drugs. We
need a balanced approach. Not a proposal that balances the budget on
the backs of our seniors.
It's just plain wrong. That's why I'm leading the charge with my bill,
the Medicare Protection Act, to protect the health, safety, and
financial security of the nearly 600,000 seniors in our state. I've
expressed strong opposition to changes in Medicare that would reduce or
eliminate guaranteed benefits or raise the eligibility age for our
hard-working seniors. And I won't back down.
Some in Washington believe the way to balance our budget is to make
blanket cuts without looking at the impact of those cuts. That's not
how we do things here in Arkansas. When it comes to protecting
Medicare, I'm fighting for you.
Thank you,
Mark Pryor
