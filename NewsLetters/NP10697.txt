Kansas Common Sense
April 14, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Working to Protect Air National Guard Cyber Red Team
This week, I met with Air National Guard Director Lt. Gen. Stanley
Clarke to discuss the 177th Information Aggressor Squadron (IAS) of the
Kansas Air National Guard. Lt. Gen. Clarke praised the talented Air
National Guardsmen who make up the Cyber Red Team Squadron of the
177th. He affirmed his commitment to the Air Guardsmen by abandoning
plans to make any manpower changes to the Squadron in Fiscal Years 2014
and 2015, which was previously resolved in Section 933 of the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2014.
As a condition of Section 933 in the NDAA and maintaining the 177th, a
study and report to Congress on "Mission Analysis for Cyber Operations
of the Department of Defense" will assess the capabilities of the
Squadron and their capacity to meet emerging threats in the cyber
domain. I intend to continue working with Lt. Gen. Clarke and the
United States Air Force to make certain the exceptional talent of the
Cyber Red Team Squadron of the 177th will be retained to perform cyber
missions and defend the nation.
Overregulation of Family Farms
Department of Labor (DOL) Secretary Thomas Perez testified before the
Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee on Wednesday. As
Ranking Member of the subcommittee, I took the opportunity to question
him about the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA)
recent attempt at regulation of family farms.
Since 1976, Congress has prohibited OSHA from targeting small farms -
defined as those with fewer than ten employees - for excessive
regulation. Yet in 2011, OSHA issued a memo declaring the Congressional
prohibition does not apply to many family farms by classifying certain
farm operations - such as the storing, drying or fumigating of grain -
as not being part of the farm. The intent by OSHA to circumvent
Congress became clear in recent months when a family farm in Nebraska
was fined $132,000 based on rules that should not even apply to them.
On December 20, 2013, I joined 42 of my Senate colleagues, from both
sides of the aisle, in calling on OSHA to immediately stop their
unlawful regulation of small farms.
On Wednesday, Secretary Perez confirmed that DOL has withdrawn the OSHA
policy memorandum and that the department takes the issue "very, very
seriously." In response to my question, the Secretary stated: "We have
instructed the team at OSHA that when you are in a circumstance where
you discover that it is a family farm - case closed." I hope this
statement is reassuring to the thousands of family farms throughout
Kansas and rural America, who can breathe easier knowing out-of-touch
bureaucrats from Washington won't be knocking down their doors to tell
them what does or does not count as farming. I will remain committed to
working with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to protect the values and
individual rights of farmers of ranchers.
Commitment to Alzheimer's Research
On Tuesday, I attended the Alzheimer's Association National Dinner and
was pleased to join nearly 1,000 advocates from across the nation who
gathered in Washington, D.C. for the Alzheimer's Association Advocacy
Forum to educate members of Congress on the urgent need to address
Alzheimer's disease. During the dinner, I was honored to receive the
Alzheimer's Association Humanitarian Award. I am humbled to be
recognized by those who I consider to be the true champions for
Alzheimer's patients and their families.
Nearly every minute, someone in America develops Alzheimer's disease.
Experts predict that with the aging of the U.S. population, the number
of Alzheimer's cases may triple by the year 2050.
Furthermore, caring
for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to cost $214
billion this year, with $150 billion covered by the federal government
through Medicare and Medicaid. Without a way to prevent, cure or
effectively treat Alzheimer's, the suffering and costs will only
continue to climb.
We must strive to achieve not only an effective treatment, but a cure
for Alzheimer's over the next decade, and I recently spoke to my
colleagues on the Senate floor about the urgent need to pursue this
goal.
Please click here to watch this speech. I look forward to
continue working to defeat Alzheimer's disease. Click here to see a
photo from the event.
Kansan Deb Miller Confirmed
On Wednesday, the Senate voted to confirm the nomination of Deb Miller
for the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Ms. Miller served as Kansas
Secretary of Transportation under three Kansas Governors - both
Democratic and Republican. The three-member STB is tasked with
overseeing the rail industry, ruling on rate disputes between shippers
and railroads.
The first woman to lead the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT),
Deb went on to become the longest-serving KDOT Secretary and only
member of the Democratic cabinet retained by current Governor Sam
Brownback. She has garnered high praise from all sides of the political
spectrum for her drive for good transportation policy, as evidenced by
her unanimous confirmation vote in the U.S. Senate. After being
nominated in September, I am pleased Deb's nomination has been
confirmed to fill the STB's vacant seat, restoring certainty for rail
shippers who rely upon the board's timely case reviews.
Hunger Strike in Cuba
This week, the Washington Post reported that American Alan Gross has
begun a hunger strike in Cuba. I am saddened to learn that detained Mr.
Gross is now in a state of even greater suffering as he continues to be
held unjustly by the Cuban government. The United States government
must continue to push Cuba for the release of Mr. Gross. His return is
long overdue, and it is extremely disappointing that it requires
life-threatening action to draw attention to his plight. We must do
everything possible to return Alan to the United States and bring his
family's terrible nightmare to an end.
Great Bend Farm and Ranch Expo
It was good to kick off my weekend back in Kansas at the Great Bend
Farm and Ranch Expo. The three-day event featured more than 700
exhibitors who highlighted the latest in farming technology and
practices. Topics of conversation at the booths ranged from the farm
bill and crop insurance, to the FAA to rural Kansas. I was glad to have
the opportunity to visit with many Kansans, including Ned Brack from
Great Bend - a U.S. Navy Veteran who served during the Vietnam War.
Thanks again to everyone who shared their thoughts and concerns with
me. Click here
to see a photo from the Expo.
Kansas Listening Tour Stop in Rush County
I continued my statewide listening tour in LaCrosse at the Rush County
Courthouse. I enjoyed the opportunity to visit with more than 25 local
residents about a wide range of topics including the need to protect
rural hospitals, protecting 2nd Amendment rights, support for the
Keystone XL pipeline and concerns about costly regulations coming out
of the federal government that are hurting farmers, bankers, and
hospitals in the area. Thanks to Rush Deputy County Clerk Tacy Keener
for helping set up the town hall meeting.
The work I do in Washington and the issues I focus on are largely based
on the conversations I have with Kansans. I greatly appreciate the
hundreds of Kansans who take the time to visit with me at town halls
because I learn something from every conversation. Check my website
for upcoming
Kansas Listening Tour stops.
Livestock Disaster Program Sign-up
I am pleased that on April 15 the USDA will begin signups for livestock
disaster programs that were reauthorized in the new Farm Bill. These
programs will be retroactive back to October 1, 2011. Livestock
Indemnity Payments (LIP) provides compensation to eligible livestock
producers who have suffered livestock death losses in excess of normal
mortality due to adverse weather. Livestock Forage Disaster Program
(LFP) provides compensation to eligible livestock producers who have
suffered grazing losses due to drought or fire. I would encourage
producers to contact their local FSA office
for more
information.
