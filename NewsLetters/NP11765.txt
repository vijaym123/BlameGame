Hungry for Excellence
Congressman
Langevin
with
culinary
students
at
the
Cranston
Area
Career
and
Technical
Center
Dear Friends,
When most people think of Napa, California, they think wine country.
Vail, Colorado, is associated with winter sports. Orlando, Florida, is
home to Disney World. These are places that have carved out
reputations. They're not just cities; they're destinations. They're
brands. With that strong sense of identity comes a vibrant hospitality
industry. And with tourism comes jobs - my top priority right now.
Therein lies the vision I have for Rhode Island; a vision that is
shared by the many farmers, fishermen, chefs, food manufacturers and
other business owners I met through my RI Food Week initiative.
We take it for granted, but our state has an incredible food economy,
and the potential for growth is significant. With the right strategy
and investments, Rhode Island could be America's top food destination.
People are already taking notice. Taste Trekkers
, a group of "foodies who love travel and travelers who love
food," hosted their 2013 Food Conference in Providence. The James Beard
Foundation
identified three RI chefs as some of the best in the region
. A Warwick
Beacon editorial
recognized that, "food is a vital part of Rhode Island's identity, and
would appear primed to serve as a cornerstone of our economic future.
We applaud those who are embracing that vision and are daring to think
outside the box."
It isn't just restaurants that support this growing perception, either.
Rhode Island has more than 1,200 working farms, and fishermen catching
fresh seafood that is served locally and shipped internationally. We
have great food manufacturers like Narragansett Creamery and Daniele,
Inc. We have the food infrastructure here to support growth. It is a
close-knit community with an ambitious dream of what Rhode Island's
food economy can accomplish. I think we should all do our part to buy
local and to help rebrand Rhode Island as a Culinary Valley.
RI Food Week was just the beginning. Learn more about our food economy
on my Twitter
, Facebook
, YouTube
and Instagram
, and catch up on all my visits through my Food Week
blog.
Sincerely,
Rep.
Langevin's

I am pleased to announce that the House passed the bipartisan Homeowner
Flood Insurance Affordability Act
. Once it
passes the Senate and is signed by the President, the bill will
alleviate some of the financial concerns
of the many coastal property owners
in Rhode Island who faced significant increases in flood insurance
costs. I know this is a big issue for many of you, and your concerns
have been heard.

Dear
Friends,
When
most
people
think
of
Napa,
California,
they
think
wine
country.
Vail,
Colorado,
is
associated
with
winter
sports.
Orlando,

Disney

These
are
places
that
have
carved
out

They&rsquo;re
not
just
cities;
they&rsquo;re
destinations.
They&rsquo;re
brands.
With
that
strong
sense
of
identity
comes
a
vibrant
hospitality
industry.
And
with
tourism
comes
jobs
&ndash;
my
top
priority
right
now.
Therein
lies
the
vision
I
have
for
Rhode
Island;
a
vision
that
is
shared
by
the
many
farmers,
fishermen,
chefs,
food
manufacturers
and
other
business
owners
I
met
through
my
RI
Food

initiative.
We
take
it

but
our

an
incredible

and
the

With
the
