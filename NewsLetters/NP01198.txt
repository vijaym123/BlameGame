Congressman Lamborn supports
Veterans Appropriations Act
4/30/15
This week,
Congressman Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 2029, the Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This
legislation increases funding for our veterans by 5.6%, in addition to the
$15 billion appropriated last summer to fund legislation designed to
decrease veteran wait times.
"This legislation is a win for our veterans. It boosts funding
by over five percent, mandates accelerations to VA claims processing,
requires a VA-DOD electronic health record, and keeps Congressional
attention focused on the VA
Department."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
