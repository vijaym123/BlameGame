$192,324 awarded to help with utility bills
Low income families in the Northern Mariana Islands will continue to receive increased LIHEAP assistance in the fiscal year that began this month. The Department of Health and Human Services has released $192,324 for the Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program to the Commonwealths Department of Community and Cultural Affairs. This is 90 percent of expected annual funding; the rest should be appropriated when Congress resumes in November. About 120 Northern Marianas households were added to LIHEAP last year as a result of a 400 percent increase in funding I was able to secure, and monthly help with CUC bills doubled on average for the 420 Marianas households now eligible for LIHEAP. I convinced then HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to use her administrative authority to increase the funding by providing data showing that poverty levels in the U.S. insular areas are three to five times the national average and that the price of electricity is two to four times higher. Households may also use the LIHEAP grants to make home improvements that save energy and lower utility bills. Congratulations DCCA!

Students from Ms. Carmens Professional Tutorial Services, led by mentor and tutor Carmen Sablan, visited the Saipan Congressional office this week to talk about school, their futures, and the importance of knowing not just what they want to do but who they want to be, when they become adults. Thank you for stopping by and for the delightful conversation we shared. Good luck with your studies and all of your future ambitions.
100% scored on Food Policy Action report card
Food Policy Action
has given me a score of 100 percent for 2014 as a result of my work on legislation supporting better food policies. I was one of only 22 Members of Congress to receive the top score. In addition to co-sponsoring the Food Security Improvement Act, I was also able to include a $32.5 million SNAP Pilot Program for the Northern Mariana Islands in the Agricultural Act of 2014. Work on the Pilot Program has already begun in the Marianas and $13.5 million of the new money will be available next October to raise benefits for our families closer to the national level of SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Food Policy Action organization promotes sensible food policies that support healthy diets, reduce hunger, and encourage sustainable farming and food production. Through education and the National Food Policy Scorecard, more people will be armed with the information they need to vote with their forks and elect more food policy leaders across the country, the organization says.

Mr. Derek Chow, Chief, Civil & Public Works Branch Programs and Project Management Division, and Mr. Tony Paresa, Deputy District Engineer for Programs and Project Management, of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, stopped by the Saipan District Office this week to brief me on the first two projects that will benefit from the statutory language I inserted in WRRDA
the Rota West Harbor feasibility study and the Tinian Harbor feasibility study.
Tinian and Rota harbor projects first to benefit from this years change in law
The Commonwealth will pay less for Army Corps of Engineers projects as a result of a change I included in WRRDA, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act , this year. Corps engineers briefed me this week on the first two projects that will benefit
the Rota West Harbor feasibility study and the Tinian Harbor feasibility study. Before the change in law, the Rota project would have cost the Commonwealth $1,224,000, now the cost will be about $989,000. The local cost of the Tinian project was likewise reduced from $1,126,500 to $891,500. The federal government pays two-thirds of the total costs for both projects. The three-year feasibility studies will determine exactly what changes need to be made to the Rota harbor, so that ships can get in no matter what the weather conditions. On Tinian the focus will be upgrading the breakwater and assuring the harbor is adequate to the needs of increased military activity.

Keeping tabs on the threat of Ebola
It is very concerning that a disease that has proven so lethal in West Africa has now spread in isolated cases to North America and Europe. I have asked staff in your congressional office in Washington to be present at briefings at the Capitol to be sure that federal preparations to respond to Ebola include the Northern Mariana Islands. We also contacted the Commonwealth Department of Public Health and learned that DPH has been in daily contact with the Centers for Disease Control in Hawaii to be prepared. DPH says a space at the Commonwealth Health Center is being retrofitted as an isolation area, where a patient infected or showing symptoms could be treated. And DPH tells us that this week they conducted a dry-run exercise to practice exactly what will be done if a patient comes in who may be infected. The White House has also published information , explaining the nature of the disease and the federal response. We have seen unexpected diseases before, such as SARS, and the world survived. But we have to take the matter seriously, stay well informed, and be prepared.
