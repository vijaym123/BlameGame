Small business are the heart and soul of the Tampa Bay economy. Nearly 100,000 small business owners in the Tampa Bay region work hard every day to find innovative ways to build larger customers bases and expand their services and products. I want to help! I am teaming up with Facebook next week in Tampa for a hands-on workshop to demonstrate and discuss how small businesses can connect to new and potential customers. I encourage small business owners to attend this free event.
