Answered Debbie Wasserman Schultz's call-to-action? NO DONATION DEADLINE: MIDNIGHT
------------ From:
Debbie Wasserman Schultz Subject:
David, I need your help
David, this one&rsquo;s personal. Three years ago, Tea Party firebrand Allen West called me "vile, unprofessional, despicable," and said I was "not a lady."
Even though he left Congress, Mr. West is still at it -- holding fundraisers around the country for top Republicans.
In fact, he&rsquo;s in Mercer County TODAY to collect massive checks from Tea Party mega-donors.
David, Cheri Bustos' opponent thinks that Tea Party extremists like West are the right company to keep. Without our help, her Illinois re-election will be in serious jeopardy.
Please -- don't let that happen. Chip in for Cheri by midnight: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Debbie Wasserman Schultz
