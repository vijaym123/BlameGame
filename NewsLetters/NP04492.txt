Enrollment
has begun for Indiana residents seeking health insurance through the
federal health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.

Earlier
this month, I had the privilege of meeting Marilyn Shank, one of
thousands of Hoosiers benefiting from the Affordable Care Act. Marilyn
and her husband are saving $1,200/month on health insurance thanks to
the ACA.
