Dear Friend,
We can't get to the bottom of the
immigration problem in this country if we're not enforcing the immigration
laws we already have on the books.
Last week, I helped make
sure that happens.
I offered an amendment to the
appropriations bill we passed for Commerce, Justice, and Science, which was
u nanimously approved
by the House,
to make sure that federal dollars aren't spent to undermine federal
immigration laws and immigration-related law enforcement.
The
bottom line is simple: if a state or locality is enforcing policies
that contradict federal immigration laws or standing in the way of
enforcing those laws, they're not going to use federal funds to do
it.
When the immigration issue comes up, it's almost always the
first thing I hear: enforce the laws on the books.
I'd like to
know what you think about this issue and, as always, anything else that's
on your mind.
You can let me know
here .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member
of Congress
Enforcing the
Laws on the Books
Congressman Collins spoke on the
House floor late Thursday night about his measure to make it clear that
we simply must enforce the immigration laws on the
books.
