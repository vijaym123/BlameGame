Dear Friends,
Earlier today, I joined my colleagues Rep. Glenn "GT"
Thompson, Rep. Scott Perry, and PA State Senator John Blake at a field
hearing in Harrisburg on "The Role of Career & Technical Education
(CTE) in Creating a Skilled Workforce: Perspectives from
Employers
and Stakeholders."
The hearing featured witness testimony from key
experts in the tech and engineering fields and was hosted by the
bipartisan Congressional Career & Technical Education Caucus, of
which Rep. Thompson is co-chairman.
Their testimony helped highlight the importance of making sure we're doing all we can do to foster the availability of jobs through career and technical education, and elevating these jobs to a professional status.
You can watch my remarks about the vast opportunities for Pennsylvanians to seize great-paying jobs through CTE by clicking
here . [Fast-forward to 10:00 mark]
As I told today's witnesses, "Let's prepare for the jobs that are available. Let's get ready for the opportunity that's there. Let's get to a point where you can walk out of the classroom and onto the field and start to produce. That's what America is looking for. That's what Pennsylvania is looking for. That's what's going to make our families strong again, make our communities strong again, and get America on the right track. ... The opportunities have never been better, the sky has never been bluer, the wind behind our back has never been stronger."
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Calls on President Obama to Enact 2005 Proposal to Update Nation's Quarantine Rules
Proposed updates to protect nation from disease scrapped by Obama administration in 2010 after protest by ACLU
On Monday, Rep. Kelly issued the following statement, in light of the ongoing Ebola crisis, calling on President Obama to finalize
a rule proposed under the Bush administration
in 2005 to update and revise regulations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to "prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States from one State or possession into another." According to
the federal register , the code of federal regulations that deals with foreign arrivals has not been updated since 1985. According to the summary of the 2005 rule proposal, "Having updated regulations in place is an important measure to ensure swift response to public health threats."
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
"It is both frustrating and shocking that there has not been a significant update to our nation's quarantine laws in nearly 30 years. In that time, there has been a dramatic increase in international travel as well an increased likelihood in the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases into America. Even though the world has changed, we're still relying on rules written when the Berlin Wall was still standing. This is totally unacceptable. Just as an army cannot succeed with outdated weapons, an effective war on Ebola cannot be waged or won with policies from three decades ago. I call on President Obama and his administration to get over its concerns for political correctness and finally enact the 2005 proposed updates for the sake of the health and security of all Americans. It's time to put America first."
USA Today, 4/1/2010 :
"The Obama administration has quietly scrapped plans to enact sweeping new federal quarantine regulations that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention touted four years ago as critical to protecting Americans from dangerous diseases spread by travelers. ... The American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU] had objected to potential passenger privacy rights violations and the proposal's 'provisional quarantine' rule."
BACKGROUND:
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) first proposed these regulatory updates on November 30, 2005, amid fear of the avian flu and as a result of the CDC's experience during the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003, when the agency faced difficulties locating and contacting airline passengers who might have been exposed to SARS during their travels. Upon announcing the proposed regulations, then-CDC Director Julie Gerberding stated that "[t]hese updated regulations are necessary to expedite and improve CDC operations by facilitating contact tracing and prompting immediate medical follow up of potentially infected passengers and their contacts."
The updated regulations would expand reporting requirements for ill passengers onboard flights and ships arriving from foreign countries. They would require airlines and ocean liners to maintain passenger and crew lists with detailed contact information and to submit these lists electronically to CDC upon request. The lists would be used to notify passengers of their suspected exposure if a sick person were not identified until after the travelers had dispersed from an arriving carrier. Additionally, the rule proposal addresses the due process rights of passengers who might be subjected to quarantine after suspected exposure to disease.

Rep. Kelly Discusses Government's Handling of
Ebola Crisis with Neil Cavuto
on Fox News
WATCH HERE
Rep. Kelly appeared on
Your World with Neil Cavuto
on Fox News Channel on Monday afternoon to discuss the Obama administration's handling of the ongoing Ebola crisis.
Highlights of Rep. Kelly's comments:
"I think you need to be very worried. Consistent with this administration: they worry more about the message than the mission."
"When I first heard Dr. [Tom] Frieden ... I said, 'You know what? Sounds pretty good.' Then I looked into his background: he's the 'Soda Pop Doc,' the New York doc [who worked with Mayor Bloomberg] who's
more concerned about sugary drinks . So they appoint Mr. Ron Klain, and I think, 'Well, maybe that's a step in the right direction.' Then I find out he's not really a doctor-he's
a spin doctor
[for Democrats]."
"We have to have somebody at the head pulling people together with a strategy that's actually going to work. [Cavuto: "Who is that?"] It's supposed to be the president. Through his ability, through his office, the executive offices, [he should be] able to direct the country in a way that we have trust and faith and confidence. And I think what we see, time after time, is that it's a false confidence. We find out it's not a true message, and then it's damage control, not disease control. And I think that's where the American people are losing faith."
"I'd rather overreact right now. I'd rather err on the caution side and then later on say, 'Listen, blame me for overreacting, but I wanted to protect the American people.'"
"We [the U.S. government] knew about this outbreak in March and we've been sitting on it-not making decisions that would protect the American people. That's not leadership. That's not taking the country in a direction where they're supposed to have faith and confidence. That's what we're supposed to do."
