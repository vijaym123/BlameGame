Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) visited the Dayton Early
College Academy (DECA) to discuss college access with students and
faculty. DECA is an early college high school that offers Dayton Public
School students an opportunity to excel academically and succeed in
their goal of graduating from college.
"Too many low-income students face obstacles when deciding whether to
pursue a college education," Portman said. "It makes sense for students
to get a head start on college courses while they are in high school,
and I enjoyed meeting with the students and faculty at the Dayton Early
College Academy to talk about ways increase access to and affordability
of college."
Portman recently introduced the Go To High School, Go To College Act
which
incentivizes students to earn college credits in high school through
the Pell Grant program. By providing students the opportunity to
simultaneously pursue a high school diploma while earning college
credits tuition-free up to an associate's degree, this bill will
maximize the efficiency of federal student aid and therefore improve
secondary and postsecondary outcomes for students.
On Tuesday, Portman, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, released
the following statement
on the Congressional Budget
Office's (CBO) 2015 Long-Term Budget Outlook:
"Today's budget outlook is another sobering reminder that we need a
more efficient, effective, and accountable government so that the
promises Washington has made to hard-working taxpayers in Ohio are
kept. If Washington continues to spend money it doesn't have, its
irresponsible fiscal policies will place an unfair burden on future
generations. CBO's projections show that the declining deficits of the
past few years are only temporary, and that Washington is about to bury
the country in an avalanche of red ink. CBO projects that even the
largest sustained surge of tax revenue in American history will not
come close to paying for the historic increase in government spending.
The more realistic 'alternative' scenario shows Washington adding $9
trillion to our already out-of-control debt over the next decade,
followed by a staggering $117 trillion in debt over the following 29
years - at which point the projections stop, because the models cannot
conceive of a functioning economy. It's time for Washington to confront
these challenges by saving Social Security, Medicare, and our other
important but unsustainable entitlement programs from bankruptcy so
that they can be around for current and future generations. If we begin
phasing in reforms now, we won't have to impose drastic reforms later
to avoid this predictable economic crisis."
Portman also met with families and advocates representing the Ohio
Children's Hospital Association
(OCHA)
in his Washington, D.C. office on Tuesday. Portman and OCHA discussed
his legislation, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act (ACE)
, which will help coordinate care and improve health outcomes for
children with medically complex conditions in Medicaid.
"I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with some of the Ohio
Children's Hospital Association's youngest patients and to discuss my
legislation to help ensure sick kids have access to quality care,"
Portman stated. "By improving coordination among pediatric providers,
we will begin to make life easier for these children and their
families. I look forward to continuing my work with the Ohio Children's
Hospital Association and others to get this important bill passed."

Portman also released the following statement
in response to the Department of Energy's (DOE)
decision to delay completion of the cleanup work at the Portsmouth
Gaseous Diffusion Plan in Piketon, Ohio from 2024 to 2052:
"Unbelievably, the Administration has now said the promised cleanup
dollars won't be there, jobs will be cut, and work in Piketon is not
likely to be completed until 2052. While campaigning for president in
2008, Barack Obama made a promise to the community to prioritize the
cleanup and prepare the site for reindustrialization as quickly as
possible. In 2009, then-Energy Secretary Chu announced a plan to
accelerate completion of the cleanup work from 2044 to 2024. Now, after
hundreds of millions in federal dollars have already been spent to
accelerate the cleanup efforts, I am shocked to learn that the project
was either severely mismanaged or the commitments made to the community
were no more than empty promises. This is unacceptable, and I intend to
hold this Administration accountable and stand up for the Ohioans they
are leaving in a lurch. I will work with my colleagues in Congress to
get this project back on track, and I again ask for the
Administration's full support."
The acknowledgement that the completion of cleanup work in Piketon will
be delayed was made by Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz in response to
a question that Portman sent to him following a February 2015 hearing
on DOE's budget request, held in the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee in February.
A copy of Senator Portman's questions
and Secretary Moniz's answers can be found here
.
Portman attended the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources'
nomination hearing on Tuesday for Dr. Monica Regalbuto to be Assistant
Secretary of Energy (Environmental Management). If confirmed, Dr.
Regalbuto will be in charge DOE's Office of Environmental Management
with oversees cleanup efforts at Piketon.
Portman submitted questions
to Dr. Regalbuto expressing concern over the Administration's $49
million cut to cleanup funding in Fiscal Year 2016 and requesting a
commitment from her that if confirmed, she will develop a long-term
plan for the cleanup efforts.
Also on Tuesday, Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) led a group
of senators
in urging the Administration to address international
trade violations that are impacting commercial truck manufacturers and
workers in Ohio. In a letter to United States Trade Representative
Michael Froman, the senators urged the Administration to take all
necessary actions with the Republic of Colombia for its failure to
honor its international trade commitments, particularly with regards to
the importation of heavy-duty commercial vehicles.
Portman touring Navistar in 2013
"Entry into trade agreements with the United States, such as the
US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, is the privilege of those
nations which abide by the rules of the international system," the
senators wrote.
"Permitting Colombia to violate its commitments
without consequence would establish a terrible precedent.
The value of
agreements negotiated with the United States would be diminished.
And
the case for enhancing the President's authority to negotiate new trade
pacts would be undercut.
"We encourage you to exercise America's prerogatives within the terms
of the free trade agreement and take all necessary actions with
Colombia until it liberalizes the trade in heavy-duty commercial
vehicles.
America's truck manufacturers and the integrity of the
international system deserve nothing less."
Full text of the letter can be found here
.
Also on Tuesday, Portman and Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.) introduced
legislation to allow federal agencies to streamline the hiring process
by cutting duplicative services and
saving taxpayer money.
The senators' Competitive Service Act would allow federal agencies to
review and select job candidates from other federal agencies' "best
qualified list" of applicants, cutting down on duplication for
applicants who have already undergone a competitive assessment process
and are certified as eligible for selection.
Currently, agencies that
have similar hiring needs cannot share such applicant information with
one another.
"It's critical that the federal government has world-class,
highly-trained individuals able to deal with sensitive national
security issues like cybersecurity and information technology," Portman
stated. "Our bill will streamline the hiring process -- enabling
agencies to share applicant pools so that qualified individuals will
not have to undergo an already slow hiring process time and time again
for similar positions across the federal government. This is a
commonsense bill to help agencies get the right people in the right
jobs in a more efficient manner."
Portman and Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) also introduced an
amendment
to the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016 to
bolster the federal government's cybersecurity workforce and strengthen
our nation's cyber defense. The Bennet-Portman amendment implements a
uniform framework to identify and address cybersecurity personnel
shortages and expedite the recruitment of highly-qualified
cybersecurity personnel.
"The federal government is responsible for securing a vast array of
sensitive information and recent hacks highlight the need to improve
our ability to protect this critical information," Portman said. "This
demands world-class, highly-trained cybersecurity employees in the
right places in the federal workforce. This amendment is an important
step toward accomplishing that goal."
The provision is based on a bill
Portman and
Bennet introduced last Congress to improve the cybersecurity workforce
across the federal government. As ranking member of the Senate Homeland
Security and Government Affairs Committee during the last Congress,
Portman successfully secured a narrower version of the bill as an
amendment during the Committee's consideration of the Department of
Homeland Security Workforce Recruitment and Retention Act, which the
Senate passed in September. The Bennet-Portman amendment to the NDAA
would apply the same measures to all federal agencies.
Over the past several decades, agencies across the federal government
have responded to the increasing threats to federal IT systems and
infrastructure by hiring personnel that fill each agency's individual
needs. As cybersecurity needs have grown across the government, it has
become increasingly clear that there is a need for a uniform system to
better educate, recruit, train, develop, and retain a highly-qualified
workforce.
On Tuesday evening, Portman received the 2015 Bruce F. Vento Public
Service Award
from the National Park Trust for his
work to protect and preserve land, water or historic resources.
A video tribute regarding Portman's efforts can be found here
.

"America's national parks are a cherished resource, and I am proud to
receive this award," Portman said. "We're fortunate to have a number of
national park units in Ohio with wonderful programs to engage our
communities, augment our quality of life, and attract tourism and new
business. I look forward to honoring the 100th anniversary of the
National Park System in 2016 and continuing my work to protect and
maintain these cherished resources."
The Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award is given annually to a public
servant who has demonstrated a lifetime of outstanding service, skill,
resourcefulness or innovation in the preservation of land, water or
historic resources for the legacy of America.
In 2000, National Park Trust established the Bruce F. Vento Public
Service Award to honor the memory and legacy of Bruce Vento, a 12-term
Member of Congress from Minnesota and former Chair of the Natural
Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.
During his tenure, Congressman Vento passed more park legislation than
any other previous chairman. Congressman Vento died on October 10, 2000
at the age of 60.
On Wednesday, Portman and Senator Brown introduced legislation to
rename the United States Postal Service facility located in Grove City,
Ohio
after Army Specialist Joseph W. Riley. Riley, a native
of Grove City, died on November 24, 2014, in Kabul Province,
Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
"Last year, I had the honor to meet with Michelle and Rodney Riley to
talk about their son, Joey, shortly after his death," said Portman.
"They said it was his dream to serve our country in the military. He
did just that, and fought bravely in Afghanistan, where he made the
ultimate sacrifice. He was 27 years old. He is part of a generation
who, for the last fourteen years, has fought-and died-to protect our
nation from the evils of terror. We must honor his memory, and this
legislation is just a small way we can pay tribute to the service and
sacrifice of this American hero."

.
Specialist Riley enlisted in the Army in June 2012; he was assigned to
1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat
Team, 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina in March 2013.
His awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart,
Army commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Afghanistan Campaign
Medal with campaign star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army
Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, NATO medal, Combat Infantryman
Badge and Basic Parachutist Badge.
On Thursday, Portman and Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Susan Collins
(R-Maine) introduced bipartisan legislation to require independent
agencies to analyze the costs and benefits of new regulations
and tailor new rules to minimize unnecessary burdens on the
economy. Portman and Warner are the co-authors of this legislation and
Collins is an original cosponsor.
"Despite exercising vast power over major sectors of our economy,
independent agencies are exempt from commonsense requirements including
analysis over how new regulations will impact jobs and the economy,"
Portman stated. "Our bill fixes that by authorizing the president to
bring them within the same regulatory review framework that applies to
other agencies.
These bipartisan reforms will provide a more stable
economic environment, promoting growth and job creation."
For 30 years, presidents of both parties have required agencies to
scrutinize the costs and benefits of major new regulations, but this
process has always exempted independent agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Federal
Communications Commission, among others. The Portman-Warner bill would
fill that gap by authorizing the president to bring independent
agencies into the same analysis and review process that governs other
regulators.
The need for this reform is obvious. According to government records,
out of the 18 major final rules issued by independent agencies in 2013,
not one was based on a complete, quantified cost-benefit analysis. The
same was true in 2012- 18 major rules, zero with a complete
cost-benefit analysis.
The figure was 17 and zero in both 2011 and
2010.
A summary of the Portman-Warner-Collins legislation can be found here
and the bill text can be found here
.
Also on Thursday, Portman announced that his amendment to strengthen
the Stryker Brigade forward deployed to Europe passed the Senate
. The amendment would allow
for $371 million to support research and development and procurement of
81 Stryker vehicles with an upgraded weapon system, with some of the
work being done at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center (JSMC) in
Lima, Ohio. Portman's amendment passed as part of the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016.
"I'm pleased my amendment to strengthen our forces in Europe has passed
the Senate," Portman stated. "It's important that our soldiers have the
equipment they need in an increasingly unstable region."
Portman and Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), co-chairs of the bipartisan
Senate Ukraine Caucus, also successfully passed an amendment
in the
full Senate as part of the NDAA, which was approved by a vote of 71-25.
The amendment adds training and best practices on post-traumatic stress
as an additional purpose of the NDAA's Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative in section 1251.
"An important part of our comprehensive efforts to support Ukraine
include helping Ukrainian health care professionals ensure that members
of the Ukrainian military are receiving the care they need," Portman
stated.
"Our bipartisan amendment will assist Ukraine as they help
their soldiers cope with the invisible wounds of war."
On Social Media:
Senators to unveil reg reform bill
A group of senators is pushing new regulatory reform legislation that
would rein in some of the most controversial federal agencies.
The regulatory reform bill from Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Mark
Warner (D-Va.) would encourage independent federal agencies to minimize
the cost of their regulations and improve transparency.
Regulators would be encouraged to adopt the least burdensome rules
under the Independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act, expected to be
introduced Thursday. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Susan Collins
(R-Maine).
"This is about getting better and smarter regulations that keep the
Obama administration from doing more harm to the economy through
regulations," Portman said.
Federal agencies are generally required to issue the least costly
regulations necessary to accomplish their goal, but some independent
agencies are exempted from this requirement.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) are both independent agencies, for example.
The regulatory reform bill would bring independent agencies like these
under the same jurisdiction. They would be required to evaluate the
costs and benefits of major rules, and explain which route would be the
least costly.
"It's going to lead to better rules," Portman said.
"It's a whole lot better than agencies just issuing rules without
having to go through this analysis, because if they didn't, we'd have
even more burdensome rules that we would have no knowledge about,"
Portman said.

Bill aims to cut agency hiring time, boost recruiting
Federal agencies would be able to more quickly hire qualified
candidates for job openings under legislation introduced by a
bipartisan pair of senators June 16.
The Competitive Service Act would allow agencies to review and select
job candidates from other agencies' "best qualified list of
applicants," which would cut down on duplicative efforts. Currently
agencies cannot share the lists of qualified candidates who have
applied for related jobs.
The bill was introduced by Senators Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Jon
Tester, D-Mont., and is co-sponsored by Ben Cardin, D-Md., Jerry Moran,
R-Kansas, and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.
Portman said it was critical that the federal government has
world-class and highly trained employees to deal with important issues
such as cybersecurity and information technology.
"Our bill will streamline the hiring process -- enabling agencies to
share applicant pools so that qualified individuals will not have to
undergo an already slow hiring process time and time again for similar
positions across the federal government. This is a common sense bill to
help agencies get the right people in the right jobs in a more
efficient manner," Portman said.

Senators say trade violations may hurt truck makers
Ohio's U.S. senators, along with legislators from five other states,
are expressing concern over Colombian trade practices that could be
hurting commercial truck manufacturers like Kenworth Truck Co.
Republican Sen. Rob Portman and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown on
Tuesday joined fellow senators from Maryland, Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia in sending a letter to U.S. Trade
Representative Michael Froman encouraging the administration to press
the Republic of Colombia to live up to its international trade
commitments.
At issue is a 2013 change by the Colombian government in the rules for
how new commercial trucks can be registered in that country.
"The buyers of new trucks must first purchase a second, old truck, and
scrap it before they can register and use their new capital purchase,"
the letter reads. "In response to this counterproductive policy, the
truck market in Colombia has shrunk by nearly 70 percent. Hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of truck exports have fallen victim to
Colombia's scrapping rule."
In Ohio, Brown and Portman said several manufacturers could be impacted
if nothing changes, including Chillicothe's Kenworth Truck Co., Detroit
PDC in Canton, Navistar in Springfield and Etna and Volvo Group across
Ohio.
The letter states that the U.S. cannot continue to allow violations of
trade agreements without consequence.

Sen. Portman offers help to Buckeye Lake businesses
As the deadline to apply for "economic disaster" status approaches,
small business owners crowded into Buckeye Lake Winery on Friday to
seek help from the federal government.
"At this point in time, it's all about the money," said Dave Levacy,
Fairfield County Commissioner and owner of Buckeye Lake Marina. "For
(U.S. Sen. Rob Portman) to be here, it's a big deal."
Portman (R-OH) hosted a small business seminar at the winery featuring
representatives from several local, state and federal agencies who
offered help and advice to struggling enterprises.
Small business owners are already feeling the effects of the lowered
water levels on Buckeye Lake, and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources has committed to keeping the water levels at their current
level until the 4.1-mile earthen dam can be fixed/replaced.
"It's going to be tough for some of these businesses," Portman said.
"In the meantime, the federal government can help with financial
assistance."
That financial assistance will mostly come in the form of loans,
Portman said, though he has endorsed a $300,000 grant proposal from
Perry, Licking and Fairfield counties that would be used for economic
development in the region.
As business owners worked the room, asking for strategic planning and
financial advice, Portman told the media he believed Buckeye Lake Dam
would be fixed/replaced in three years rather than five.
"We're trying to get this dam fixed as quickly as possible," Portman
said. "Everybody wants it to be safe."

Stop revolving door in criminal justice system
There are a record number of people behind bars today and about 95
percent of them will one day be released. More than half of those
former inmates will end up back in jail or prison, however, repeating a
cycle that causes more crime, more broken families, and millions of
dollars in higher costs to all of us taxpayers. This revolving door in
the criminal justice system highlights our failures when it comes to
rehabilitation.
To address this problem, I wrote legislation called the Second Chance
Act which takes a small part of the money we spend on prosecuting and
incarcerating people and puts it towards supporting state and local
re-entry programs.
It focuses on job training, mental health counseling, and drug
addiction services for former inmates to get them back into productive
lives.
The Second Chance Act has awarded competitive grants to government
agencies and nonprofit groups across 49 states for reentry programs to
serve both adults and juveniles. About 100,000 people have participated
in Second Chance programs and Ohio has used it aggressively to reduce
recidivism.
>From 2013 to 2014 the recidivism rate in Ohio dropped from 28.7% to
27.1%, continuing progress that has made our state recidivism rate the
lowest in 24 years, and well below the national average of 49.7%.
Back home I recently met a man who first went to prison when he was
only 16 years old. Alvis House, a recipient of Second Chance grants
that helps with re-entry programs, helped him develop necessary skills
that allowed him to become a welder and hold a steady job.
Now, he has custody of his son for the first time in his life and he is
focused on working hard and being good father. He was given a second
chance and he embraced it. Instead of being a burden on taxpayers, he
is working and paying taxes. Allowing people to reach their God-given
potential is exactly what my legislation is all about. I am very proud
of what we have been able to accomplish so far, but there is more to do.
Like many other laws, the Second Chance Act sunsets and has to be
reviewed and reauthorized. Because of the positive results it has
produced, I proudly introduced S.1513, the Second Chance
Reauthorization Act of 2015, this month.
Let's continue the progress we've made in stopping the revolving door
in the criminal justice system and give more Americans the opportunity
to learn from their mistakes. Let's pass this new law to give more
Americans the second chance they deserve.
("Stop revolving door in criminal justice system," Senator Rob Portman.

Secretary
Chu
announced
a
plan
to
accelerate
completion
of
the
cleanup
work
from
2044
to
2024.
Now,
after
hundreds
of
millions
in
federal
dollars
have
already
been
spent
to
accelerate
the
cleanup
efforts,
I
am
shocked
to
learn
that
the
project
was
either
severely
mismanaged
or
the
commitments
made
to
the
community
were
no
more
than
empty
promises.
This
is
unacceptable,
and
I
intend
to
hold
this
Administration
accountable
and
stand
up
for
the
Ohioans
they
are
leaving
in
a
lurch.
I
will
work
with
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
get
this
project
back
on
track,
and
I
again
ask
for
the
Administration's
full
support.&#8221;
The
acknowledgement
that
the
completion
of
cleanup
work
in
Piketon
will
be
delayed
was
made
by
Secretary
of
Energy
Ernest
Moniz
in
response
to
a
question
that
Portman
sent
to
him
following
a
February
2015
hearing
on
DOE&#8217;s
budget
request,
held
in
the
Senate
Energy
and
Natural
Resources
Committee
in
February.

nomination
hearing
on

to
be
Assistant

Dr.
Regalbuto
will
be
in
charge

Office
of
Environmental
Management
with
oversees

at

Portman
submitted
questions
to
Dr.
Regalbuto
expressing
concern
over
the
Administration&#8217;s
$49
million
cut
to
cleanup
funding
in
Fiscal
Year

and
requesting
a
commitment
from
her
that
if
confirmed,
she
will
develop
a
long-term
plan
for
the
cleanup
efforts.
Also
on
Tuesday,
Portman
and
Senator
Sherrod
Brown
(D-Ohio)
led
a
group
of
senators
in
urging
the
Administration
to
address
international
trade
violations
that
are
impacting
commercial
truck
manufacturers
and
workers
in
Ohio.
In
a
letter
to
United
States
Trade
Representative
Michael
Froman,
the
senators
urged
the
Administration
to
take
all
necessary
actions
with
the
Republic
of
Colombia
for
its
failure
to
honor
its
international
trade
commitments,
particularly
with
regards
to
the
importation
of
heavy-duty
commercial
vehicles.
Portman
touring
Navistar
in
2013
&#8220;Entry
into
trade
agreements
with
the
United
States,
such
as
the
US-Colombia
Trade
Promotion
Agreement,
is
the
privilege
of
those
nations
which
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
international
system,&#8221;
the
senators
wrote.
&#8220;Permitting
Colombia
to
violate
its
commitments
without
consequence
would
establish
a
terrible
precedent.
The
value
of
agreements
negotiated
with
the
United
States
would
be
diminished.
And
the
case
for
enhancing
the
President&#8217;s
authority
to
negotiate
new
trade
pacts
would
be
undercut.
&#8220;We
encourage
you
to
exercise
America&#8217;s
prerogatives
within
the
terms
of
the
free
trade
agreement
and
take
all
necessary
actions
with
Colombia
until
it
liberalizes
the
trade
in
heavy-duty
commercial
vehicles.
America&#8217;s
truck
manufacturers
and
the
integrity
of
the
international
system
deserve
nothing
less.&#8221;

Also
on
Tuesday,
Portman
and
Senator
Jon
Tester
(D-Mont.)
introduced
legislation
to
allow
federal
agencies
to
streamline
the
hiring
process
by
cutting
duplicative
services
and
saving
taxpayer
money.
The
senators&#8217;
Competitive
Service
Act
would
allow
federal
agencies
to
review
and
select
job
candidates
from
other
federal
agencies&#8217;
&#8220;best
qualified
list&#8221;
of
applicants,
cutting
down
on
duplication
for
applicants
who
have
already
undergone
a
competitive
assessment
process
and
are
certified
as
eligible
for
selection.
Currently,
agencies
that
have
similar
hiring
needs
cannot
share
such
applicant
information
with
one
another.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
critical
that
the
federal
government
has
world-class,
highly-trained
individuals
able
to
deal
with
sensitive
national
security
issues
like
cybersecurity
and
information
technology,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Our
bill
will
streamline
the
hiring
process
--
enabling
agencies
to
share
applicant
pools
so
that
qualified
individuals
will
not
have
to
undergo
an
already
slow
hiring
process
time
and
time
again
for
similar
positions
across
the
federal
government.
This
is
a
commonsense
bill
to
help
agencies
get
the
right
people
in
the
right
jobs
in
a
more
efficient
manner.&#8221;
Portman
and
Senator
Michael
Bennet
(D-Colo.)
also
introduced
an
amendment
to
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
for
Fiscal
Year
2016
to
bolster
the
federal
government&#8217;s
cybersecurity
workforce
and
strengthen
our
nation&#8217;s
cyber
defense.
The
Bennet-Portman
amendment
implements
a
uniform
framework
to
identify
and
address
cybersecurity
personnel
shortages
and
expedite
the
recruitment
of
highly-qualified
cybersecurity
personnel.
&#8220;The
federal
government
is
responsible
for
securing
a
vast
array
of
sensitive
information
and
recent
hacks
highlight
the
need
to
improve
our
ability
to
protect
this
critical
information,&#8221;
Portman
said.
&#8220;This
demands
world-class,
highly-trained
cybersecurity
employees
in
the
right
places
in
the
federal
workforce.
This
amendment
is
an
important
step
toward
accomplishing
that
goal.&#8221;
The
provision
is
based
on
a
bill
Portman
and
Bennet
introduced
last
Congress
to
improve
the
cybersecurity
workforce
across
the
federal
government.
As
ranking
member
of
the
Senate
Homeland
Security
and
Government
Affairs
Committee
during
the
last
Congress,
Portman
successfully
secured
a
narrower
version
of
the
bill
as
an
amendment
during
the
Committee&#8217;s
consideration
of
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
Workforce
Recruitment
and
Retention
Act,
which
the
Senate
passed
in
September.
The
Bennet-Portman
amendment
to
the
NDAA
would
apply
the
same
measures
to
all
federal
agencies.
Over
the
past
several
decades,
agencies
across
the
federal
government
have
responded
to
the
increasing
threats
to
federal
IT
systems
and
infrastructure
by
hiring
personnel
that
fill
each
agency&#8217;s
individual
needs.
As
cybersecurity
needs
have
grown
across
the
government,
it
has
become
increasingly
clear
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
uniform
system
to
better
educate,
recruit,
train,
develop,
and
retain
a
highly-qualified
workforce.
On
Tuesday
evening,
Portman
received
the
2015
Bruce
F.
Vento
Public
Service
Award
from
the
National
Park
Trust
for
his
work
to
protect
and
preserve
land,
water
or
historic
resources.

&#8220;America's
national
parks
are
a
cherished
resource,
and
I
am
proud
to
receive
this
award,&#8221;
Portman
said.
&#8220;We're
fortunate
to
have
a
number
of
national
park
units
in
Ohio
with
wonderful
programs
to
engage
our
communities,
augment
our
quality
of
life,
and
attract
tourism
and
new
business.
I
look
forward
to
honoring
the
100th
anniversary
of
the
National
Park
System
in
2016
and
continuing
my
work
to
protect
and
maintain
these
cherished
resources.&#8221;
The
Bruce
F.
Vento
Public
Service
Award
is
given
annually
to
a
public
servant
who
has
demonstrated
a
lifetime
of
outstanding
service,
skill,
resourcefulness
or
innovation
in
the
preservation
of
land,
water
or
historic
resources
for
the
legacy
of
America.
In
2000,
National
Park
Trust
established
the
Bruce
F.
Vento
Public
Service
Award
to
honor
the
memory
and
legacy
of
Bruce
Vento,
a
12-term
Member
of
Congress
from
Minnesota
and
former
Chair
of
the
Natural
Resources
Subcommittee
on
National
Parks,
Forests,
and
Public
Lands.
During
his
tenure,
Congressman
Vento
passed
more
park
legislation
than
any
other
previous
chairman.
Congressman
Vento
died
on
October
10,
2000
at
the
age
of
60.
On
Wednesday,
Portman
and
Senator
Brown
introduced
legislation
to
rename
the
United
States
Postal
Service
facility
located
in
Grove
City,
Ohio
after
Army
Specialist
Joseph
W.
Riley.
Riley,
a
native
of
Grove
City,
died
on
November
24,
2014,
in
Kabul
Province,
Afghanistan,
in
support
of
Operation
Enduring
Freedom.
&#8220;Last
year,
I
had
the
honor
to
meet
with
Michelle
and
Rodney
Riley
to
talk
about
their
son,
Joey,
shortly
after
his
death,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;They
said
it
was
his
dream
to
serve
our
country
in
the
military.
He
did
just
that,
and
fought
bravely
in
Afghanistan,
where
he
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice.
He
was
27
years
old.
He
is
part
of
a
generation
who,
for
the
last
fourteen
years,
has
fought&#8212;and
died&#8212;to
protect
our
nation
from
the
evils
of
terror.
We
must
honor
his
memory,
and
this
legislation
is
just
a
small
way
we
can
pay
tribute
to
the
service
and
sacrifice
of
this
American
hero.&#8221;

On
Thursday,
Portman
and
Senators
Mark
Warner
(D-Va.)
and
Susan
Collins
(R-Maine)
introduced
bipartisan
legislation
to
require
independent
agencies
to
analyze
the
costs
and
benefits
of
new
regulations
and
tailor
new
rules
to
minimize
unnecessary
burdens
on
the
economy. Portman
and
Warner
are
the
co-authors
of
this
legislation
and
Collins
is
an
original
cosponsor.
&#8220;Despite
exercising
vast
power
over
major
sectors
of
our
economy,
independent
agencies
are
exempt
from
commonsense
requirements
including
analysis
over
how
new
regulations
will
impact
jobs
and
the
economy,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Our
bill
fixes
that
by
authorizing
the
president
to
bring
them
within
the
same
regulatory
review
framework
that
applies
to
other
agencies.
These
bipartisan
reforms
will
provide
a
more
stable
economic
environment,
promoting
growth
and
job
creation.&#8221;
For
30
years,
presidents
of
both
parties
have
required
agencies
to
scrutinize
the
costs
and
benefits
of
major
new
regulations,
but
this
process
has
always
exempted
independent
agencies,
such
as
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission,
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission,
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board,
and
the
Federal
Communications
Commission,
among
others.
The
Portman-Warner
bill
would
fill
that
gap
by
authorizing
the
president
to
bring
independent
agencies
into
the
same
analysis
and
review
process
that
governs
other
regulators.
The
need
for
this
reform
is
obvious. According
to
government
records,
out
of
the
18
major
final
rules
issued
by
independent
agencies
in
2013,
not
one
was
based
on
a
complete,
quantified
cost-benefit
analysis. The
same
was
true
in
2012&#8212;
18
major
rules,
zero
with
a
complete
cost-benefit
analysis.
The
figure
was
17
and
zero
in
both
2011
and
2010.

legislation

Also
on
Thursday,
Portman
announced
that
his
amendment
to
strengthen
the
Stryker
Brigade
forward
deployed
to
Europe
passed
the
Senate .
The
amendment
would
allow
for
$371
million
to
support

and
development
and
procurement
of
81
Stryker
vehicles
with
an
upgraded
weapon
system,

the
work
being
done
at

Joint
Systems
Manufacturing
Center
(JSMC)

amendment

as
part
of
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
for
Fiscal

2016.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
my
amendment
to
strengthen
our
forces
in
Europe
has
passed
the
Senate,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
important
that
our
soldiers
have
the
equipment
they
need
in
an
increasingly
unstable
region.&#8221;
Portman
and
Senator
Dick
Durbin
(D-Ill.),
co-chairs
of
the
bipartisan
Senate
Ukraine
Caucus,
also
successfully
passed
an
amendment
in
the
full
Senate
as
part
of
the
NDAA,
which
was
approved
by
a
vote
of
71-25.
The
amendment
adds
training
and
best
practices
on
post-traumatic
stress
as
an
additional
purpose
of
the
NDAA&#8217;s
Ukraine
Security
Assistance
Initiative
in
section
1251.
&#8220;An
important
part
of
our
comprehensive
efforts
to
support
Ukraine
include
helping
Ukrainian
health
care
professionals
ensure
that
members
of
the
Ukrainian
military
are
receiving
the
care
they
need,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Our
bipartisan
amendment
will
assist
Ukraine
as
they
help
their
soldiers
cope
with
the
invisible
wounds
of
war.&#8221;
On
Social
Media:
Senators
to
unveil
reg
reform
bill
A
group
of
senators
is
pushing
new
regulatory
reform
legislation
that
would
rein
in
some
of
the
most
controversial
federal
agencies.
The
regulatory
reform
bill
from
Sens.
Rob
Portman
(R-Ohio)
and
Mark
Warner
(D-Va.)
would
encourage
independent
federal
agencies
to
minimize
the
cost
of
their
regulations
and
improve
transparency.
Regulators
would
be
encouraged
to
adopt
the
least
burdensome
rules
under
the
Independent
Agency
Regulatory
Analysis
Act,
expected
to
be
introduced
Thursday.
The
bill
is
co-sponsored
by
Sen.
Susan
Collins
(R-Maine).
"This
is
about
getting
better
and
smarter
regulations
that
keep
the
Obama
administration
from
doing
more
harm
to
the
economy
through
regulations,"
Portman
said.
Federal
agencies
are
generally
required
to
issue
the
least
costly
regulations
necessary
to
accomplish
their
goal,
but
some
independent
agencies
are
exempted
from
this
requirement.
The
National
Labor
Relations
Board
(NLRB)
and
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB)
are
both
independent
agencies,
for
example.
The
regulatory
reform
bill
would
bring
independent
agencies
like
these
under
the
same
jurisdiction.
They
would
be
required
to
evaluate
the
costs
and
benefits
of
major
rules,
and
explain
which
route
would
be
the
least
costly.
"It's
going
to
lead
to
better
rules,"
Portman
said.
&#8230;
"It's
a
whole
lot
better
than
agencies
just
issuing
rules
without
having
to
go
through
this
analysis,
because
if
they
didn't,
we'd
have
even
more
burdensome
rules
that
we
would
have
no
knowledge
about,"
Portman
said.

Bill
aims

agency
hiring
time,
boost
recruiting
Federal
agencies
would
be
able
to
more
quickly
hire
qualified
candidates
for
job
openings
under
legislation
introduced
by
a
bipartisan
pair
of
senators
June

The
Competitive
Service
Act
would
allow
agencies
to
review
and
select
job
candidates
from
other
agencies'
"best
qualified
list
of
applicants,"
which
would
cut
down
on
duplicative
efforts.
Currently
agencies
cannot
share
the
lists
of
qualified
candidates
who
have
applied
for
related
jobs.

Representative
Michael

encouraging

administration
to
press
the
Republic
of
Colombia
to
live
up
to
its

commitments.
At

is
a
2013
change
by
the
Colombian
government
in
the
rules
for
how
new
commercial
trucks
can
be
registered
in
that
country.
&#8220;The
buyers
of
new
trucks
must
first
purchase
a
second,
old
truck,
and
scrap
it
before
they
can
register
and
use
their
new
capital
purchase,&#8221;
the
letter
reads.
&#8220;In
response
to
this
counterproductive
policy,
the
truck
market
in
Colombia
has
shrunk
by
nearly
70
percent.
Hundreds

Sen.
Portman
offers
help
to
Buckeye
Lake
businesses
As
the
deadline
to
apply
for
"economic
disaster"
status
approaches,
small
business
owners
crowded
into
Buckeye
Lake
Winery
on
Friday
to
seek
help
from
the
federal
government.
"At
this
point
in
time,
it's
all
about
the
money,"
said
Dave
Levacy,
Fairfield
County
Commissioner
and
owner
of
Buckeye
Lake
Marina.
"For
(U.S.
Sen.
Rob
Portman)
to
be
here,
it's
a
big
deal."
Portman
(R-OH)
hosted
a
small
business
seminar
at
the
winery
featuring
representatives
from
several
local,
state
and
federal
agencies
who
offered
help
and
advice
to
struggling
enterprises.
Small
business
owners
are
already
feeling
the
effects
of
the
lowered
water
levels
on
Buckeye
Lake,
and
the
Ohio
Department
of
Natural
Resources
has
committed
to
keeping
the
water
levels
at
their
current
level
until
the
4.1-mile
earthen
dam
can
be
fixed/replaced.
"It's
going
to
be
tough
for
some
of
these
businesses,"
Portman
said.
"In
the
meantime,
the
federal
government
can
help
with
financial
assistance."
That
financial
assistance
will
mostly
come
in
the
form
of
loans,
Portman
said,
though
he
has
endorsed
a
$300,000
grant
proposal
from
Perry,
Licking
and
Fairfield
counties
that
would
be
used
for
economic
development
in
the
region.
&#8230;
As
business
owners
worked
the
room,
asking
for
strategic
planning
and
financial
advice,
Portman
told
the
media
he
believed
Buckeye
Lake
Dam
would
be
fixed/replaced
in
three
years
rather
than
five.
"We're
trying
to
get
this
dam
fixed
as
quickly
as
possible,"
Portman
said.
"Everybody
wants
it
to
be
safe."

Stop
revolving
door
in
criminal
justice
system
There
are
a
record
number
of
people
behind
bars
today
and
about
95
percent
of
them
will
one
day
be
released.
More
than
half
of
those
former
inmates
will
end
up
back
in
jail
or
prison,
however,
repeating
a
cycle
that
causes
more
crime,
more
broken
families,
and
millions
of
dollars
in
higher
costs
to
all
of
us
taxpayers.
This
revolving
door
in
the
criminal
justice
system
highlights
our
failures
when
it
comes
to
rehabilitation.
To
address
this
problem,
I
wrote
legislation
called
the
Second
Chance
Act
which
takes
a
small
part
of
the
money
we
spend
on
prosecuting
and
incarcerating
people
and
puts
it
towards
supporting
state
and
local
re-entry
programs.
It
focuses
on
job
training,
mental
health
counseling,
and
drug
addiction
services
for
former
inmates
to
get
them
back
into
productive
lives.
The
Second
Chance
Act
has
awarded
competitive
grants
to
government
agencies
and
nonprofit
groups
across
49
states
for
reentry
programs
to
serve
both
adults
and
juveniles.
About
100,000
people
have
participated
in
Second
Chance
programs
and
Ohio
has
used
it
aggressively
to
reduce
recidivism.
From
2013
to
2014
the
recidivism
rate
in
Ohio
dropped
from
28.7%
to
27.1%,
continuing
progress
that
has
made
our
state
recidivism
rate
the
lowest
in
24
years,
and
well
below
the
national
average
of
49.7%.
&#8230;
Back
home
I
recently
met
a
man
who
first
went
to
prison
when
he
was
only
16
years
old.
Alvis
House,
a
recipient
of
Second
Chance
grants
that
helps
with
re-entry
programs,
helped
him
develop
necessary
skills
that
allowed
him
to
become
a
welder
and
hold
a
steady
job.
Now,
he
has
custody
of
his
son
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
he
is
focused
on
working
hard
and
being
good
father.
He
was
given
a
second
chance
and
he
embraced
it.
Instead
of
being
a
burden
on
taxpayers,
he
is
working
and
paying
taxes.
Allowing
people
to
reach
their
God-given
potential
is
exactly
what
my
legislation
is
all
about.
I
am
very
proud
of
what
we
have
been
able
to
accomplish
so
far,
but
there
is
more
to
do.
Like
many
other
laws,
the
Second
Chance
Act
sunsets
and
has
to
be
reviewed
and
reauthorized.
Because
of
the
positive
results
it
has
produced,
I
proudly
introduced
S.1513,
the
Second
Chance
Reauthorization
Act
of
2015,
this
month.
&#8230;
Let&#8217;s
continue
the
progress
we&#8217;ve
made
in
stopping
the
revolving
door
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
give
more
Americans
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
their
mistakes.
Let&#8217;s
pass
this
new
law
to
give
more
Americans
the
second
chance
they
deserve.
(&#8220;Stop
revolving
door
in
criminal
justice
system,&#8221;
Senator
Rob
Portman.
