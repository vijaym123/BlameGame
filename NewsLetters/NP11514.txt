Dear Friend:
Tonight, I will be joining more than two dozen of my colleagues at an &ldquo;all-nighter&rdquo; on the Senate floor to urge action on climate change. So many Senators coming together for an all-night session shows our commitment to wake up Congress to the dangers of climate change.
You can join us tonight on social media using the hashtag #Up4Climate, or watch us
live
from approximately 7PM ET/4PM PT to 9AM ET/6AM PT Tuesday morning.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
