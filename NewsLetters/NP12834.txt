My View of the State of the Union
Address
President Obama had the spotlight on Tuesday as he delivered a
65-minute speech to the American people and
Congress.
Instead of using the opportunity to embrace bipartisan cooperation to
meet the countrys challenges, he outlined a strategy for getting
around
a divided Congress.
He seems intent on
signing a series of executive actions without congressional
approval.
This go it alone approach may very well violate the
Constitution.
Many opportunities exist for the
President and the Congress to work together.
For starters, we could
also speed efforts to expand trade opportunities and open overseas
markets to U.S. goods.
We could join together on the
Keystone Pipeline to create thousands of permanent new jobs and promote
Americas energy independence.
In 2014, I will be
working every day to promote job growth, reduce deficits, and create a
stronger, more prosperous America.
I hope that in the months ahead
the President will sincerely try to join with the Congress to accomplish
these important goals.

President Highlights International Trade
As part of
his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama made a
strong case for increased international trade.
I was heartened
Tuesday night by President Obamas call for the Congress to approve
bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority legislation, Rodney said.
However, I was disappointed the very next day to hear Senate Majority Leader
Harry Reid declare his opposition to this common sense
legislation.
International trade is indispensible to the economic
strength of America, and New Jersey specifically.
Every year, billions
of dollars of goods made in the United States flow through the Port
of New York and New Jersey to nations across the globe.
The Port
spurs more than $36 billion in economic activity annually, and is
responsible for 279,000 jobs.
The President needs to educate
the Senate Majority Leader on the merits of opening foreign markets to
U.S. goods and services!
Americas War Footing
in the State of the Union
I was discouraged to
hear the President declare, America must move off a permanent war
footing.
Representing
a 9-11 State I cannot accept the
Presidents judgment, said Rodney, the Chairman of the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee who serves with members of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence.
We understand that
Americans have grown weary of the combat in Afghanistan.
However, the serious threats to our security are numerous and growing: al
Qaeda- associated groups doggedly plotting to attack us and our allies,
daily serious cyber attacks, an Iran that is determined to achieve
nuclear weapons capability and an increasingly militaristic
China.
We must never return to a pre-911 mentality which found
us unprepared and vulnerable.
Surely, violent international
extremists are on their own offensive war-footing!
Our job on
the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee is to ensure that our
American men and women in uniform, and their families, have everything they
need.
Its also our responsibility to provide the resources so
that the military and the intelligence community can execute any mission
given them by the President. The President may call this a permanent
war footing.
I call it being prepared to protect the American
people!
