Dear
Friends,
I am pleased to report that two of my bills that promise
to improve the lives of Idahoans and grow our economy were approved in
committee last week. That both are aimed at easing federal regulatory
burdens is particularly gratifying.
The first bill
H.R.
5040, the Idaho County Shooting Range Land Conveyance Act
would
establish a county-operated range on 31 acres of U.S. Bureau of Land
Management land. The BLM worked closely with my office and supports
transferring this parcel to Idaho County. An old landfill, the site is
informally used by hunters and the general public and well-suited to
providing a safe shooting experience.
But because the land has
been identified for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic
River System it could not be transferred administratively by the
BLM.
After nearly six years, with the cooperation of the BLM
Cottonwood office, Idaho County commissioners and Idaho County sheriff, we were
able to find a legislative remedy.
Its a win-win for both
levels of government and an affirmation of our Second Amendment
rights.
At the same Sept. 18 meeting of the House Natural
Resources Committee, H.R. 1363, the Exploring for Geothermal Energy on
Federal Lands Act, was approved by my colleagues. Both bills now head to
the House floor, where I hope to press for action when Congress returns
after the election.
H.R. 1363, which passed the U.S. House
in the last Congress, lifts an administrative burden that has
frustrated developers of an abundant resource common in the
West.
Current law requires each and every geothermal exploratory hole be
subject to an individual environmental review
no matter how close it
might be to a site already explored. That process could take up to two
years.
As you can imagine, that discouraged energy companies
from investment and curtailed public access to this important
resource.
My bill improves on these regulations to ease
exploration, while protecting the environment. Areas currently barred from
exploration would remain off limits. Firm deadlines would be set for
permitting, road construction and off-road vehicle use minimized and surface
impacts contained. The bill does not subsidize the industry, but does
provide the certainty business needs to make prudent
decisions.
Idahos experience with geothermal is unique. Our 100-year-old
Statehouse is heated by subterranean hot water, as are parts of the
Boise State University campus and homes along and near Warm Springs Avenue
in Boise.
In Idaho alone, the geothermal industry has the
potential to generate more than 800 megawatts -- enough to power more
than 500,000 homes. Its time we unleash the private sector to harness
this clean, renewable and reliable form of energy.
Thank
