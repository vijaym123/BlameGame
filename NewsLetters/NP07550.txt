Sorry to email you early on a Saturday -- but we&rsquo;re on full
RED ALERT
at Democratic Headquarters.
The White House announced that Boehner has &ldquo;opened the door&rdquo; to impeaching President Obama.
FOX NEWS reports that a MAJORITY of Republicans want to impeach Obama.
A vote to sue President Obama on the House floor is IMMINENT.
Bottom line: We&rsquo;re in the middle of an unprecedented attack on the President. We&rsquo;re doing all we can -- but we can&rsquo;t afford to cut corners. We have to fight back with everything we&rsquo;ve got. According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in since Republicans authorized a vote to sue President Obama.
