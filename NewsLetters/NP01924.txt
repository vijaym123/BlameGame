Graham
and Lamborn Sponsor Bipartisan US-Israel Anti-Tunnel Defense
Cooperation Act
3/24/15
Today, Representatives Gwen Graham
(D-FL) and Doug Lamborn (R-CO) announced H.R. 1349, the US-Israel
Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act, to authorize research and development
of an anti-tunneling defense system to protect Israel from terrorist
attacks.
Every day, our closest ally in the Middle East
Israel
lives under the constant threat of terrorist attacks launched
from underground tunnels, Rep. Graham said. The US-Israel Anti-Tunnel
Defense Cooperation Act will authorize an unprecedented new
initiative to protect Israel from this dangerous
threat.
The US-Israel Anti-Tunnel
Defense Cooperation Act is similar to the 2011 legislative
authorization for the highly successful Iron Dome Anti-Missile Defense System,
which has stopped more than 1,200 rockets from hitting
Israel.
Rep. Doug
Lamborn added, "This past summer Iron Dome, the joint U.S.- Israel
developed technology, saved thousands of Israeli citizens lives. Now,
Hamas and other terrorist groups are taking to the underground tunnels.
This is a challenge not only to Israel but to the U.S. as well. I hope
that this cooperation with Israel will emulate the success of Iron Dome
so that we can find a solution that will protect American and Israeli
lives."
The terrorist group, Hamas, has spent nearly $100 million to
construct tunnels for smuggling weapons, money and supplies into Gaza, as
well as launching terrorist attacks within Israels borders.
In
2006, Hamas kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit through a tunnel
and held him for five years, and in the summer 2014 conflict between
Israel and Hamas, Israel Defense Forces discovered 32 tunnels, 14 of
which crossed directly into
Israel.
To secure peace, we must first help
Israel secure their state from terrorist attacks, Rep. Graham said. Iron
Dome has saved countless civilian lives, and I believe an
anti-tunneling defense shield will save countless
more.
The bipartisan legislation is
endorsed by AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. In
addition to helping Israel secure its borders, the anti-tunneling
defense technology discovered in this joint project could also be used to
protect American military bases and our nations borders with Mexico
and Canada.
This bill, which authorizes research, development and test
activities between the United States and Israel in order to better detect
and destroy these tunnels, will help both the United States and Israel
defend against future threats emanating from tunnels, AIPACs
directors of government affairs wrote in an endorsement letter. This bill
promotes real cooperation and cost-sharing between Washington and
Jerusalem on this key challenge.
