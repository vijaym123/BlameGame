Dear Friends,
Last week was a productive and
substantive week in
Washington.
Supporting our Military and Veterans:
The
House passed an important bill last week that funded the Department of
Veterans Affairs and important military construction projects. As a
former Air Force Pilot, I know first hand how hard veterans work to
protect our freedoms, and it's important that we provide them with the
benefits that they deserve. This bipartisan bill also improves oversight at
the VA to prevent backlogs in VA
cases.
Working to Control Federal Regulatory
Agencies:
I've learned over the past couple of weeks about federal
regulatory agencies such as the Department of Education, the
Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that have
created and are using their own paramilitary like teams. This is of great
concern to me as it causes a huge distrust between the American
people and the federal government. Local governments have primary
responsibility for law enforcement in their communities. Federal regulatory
agencies should not be relying on their own paramilitary units. I'm
working to defund these unnecessary law enforcement teams. Read more about
this in the
Washington Times ,
Fox News.com
and the
Salt Lake Tribune .
Additionally, you can watch an interview I did on the
Fox
Business Network :
