Wisdom of the District: Iranian Sanctions
Recently, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and Iran agreed to an implementation plan to halt Irans nuclear program in exchange for the world lifting some existing economic sanctions on the country.
After six months, if Iran is not honoring this plan, all of the current sanctions will go back into place.
However, some American lawmakers in both parties think the threat of specific additional economic sanctions that would kick in if Iran fails to honor the plan will ensure Iran holds up its end of the bargain.
President Obama disagrees, saying that U.S. diplomats should have the flexibility to continue their work.
He has threatened to veto any sanction legislation that comes out of Congress. ( click here for source)
Do you believe additional sanctions against Iran during the implementation of the agreement are appropriate?
( )
Yes. Sanctions have been effective at damaging Irans economy and bringing them to the negotiating table. Additional sanctions will keep them there. If they are going to uphold their commitment, these sanctions shouldnt worry them.
( )
Yes. There is no way Iran is going to do what it says it will do, and its better to make clear the repercussions now.
( )
No. The existing sanctions are strong enough. We should trust the Iranians are going to do what they say they will do and then reconsider if they dont.
( ) I dont believe we should be negotiating with Iran in the first place.
I have another answer.
