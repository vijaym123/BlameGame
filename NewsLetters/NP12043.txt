David --
This is shameless.
My opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling, just attacked me for &ldquo;not supporting Medicare.&rdquo; Mr. Schilling needs to get his facts straight.
I have supported Medicare and Social Security since my first day in office, and I will continue fighting to protect these vital services for our seniors in 2014 and every year that I serve the people of Illinois in Congress. Here are some actual facts:
While Mr. Schilling was in office, he voted for Paul Ryan&rsquo;s Tea Party budget -- the budget that would have ended Medicare as we know it -- not once, but TWICE!
We need to get out the truth to Illinois voters immediately. We need to make sure voters are armed with the facts and don&rsquo;t believe these deceitful attacks. David, please click here to chip in $3 or whatever you can to my Illinois Rapid Response Fund to help us fight back with the facts &gt;&gt;
Let me be clear: ex-Congressman Schilling is a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. Now that he knows his extreme Tea Party record is a tough sell, he's attempting to distract voters by distorting mine.
I&rsquo;m counting on your support to get out the facts. Will you chip in $3 or more to fund our response? http://action.cheribustos.com/Get-Out-The-Facts
Thanks for standing with me,
