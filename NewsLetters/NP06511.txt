Northern Marianas College Dean of Administration David Attao, College President Dr. Sharon Hart, and NMC Regent William Torres met with their congressional office this week to discuss the challenges facing our local college, especially in its efforts to train local workers for jobs in the Northern Marianas economy. The College team met with federal agencies and educational associations, as well, while here in Washington in their quest for alternative resources to improve NMC facilities and programs.

The Northern Marianas community in Oregon hosted the 2014 CNMI Labor Day Goodwill Softball Tournament last weekend. This event just keeps getting bigger, and I go every year, congressional schedule permitting. Northern Marianas ballplayers from up and down the Western U.S. and from the NMI, as well as their friends and families, all get together for a weekend of competition and camaraderie. I was asked to open the event, which takes place in a different city each year and has become a showcase for the good spirits and sense of community that are hallmarks of our island culture
not to mention our love of baseball! Congratulations to the organizers, fans, and team members for another memorable Tournament.
World War II veterans honored
Judge David Wiseman and his wife Faythe recently used their congressional office as a fitting location for presentation of posthumous awards to the families of two men, who served in our nations armed forces on Saipan and Tinian during World War II. The men honored were 1st Lt. Russell Leroy French and Major Berchmans Cotter. Lt. Frenchs sons, Vice Admiral Bill French and Captain Tim French (Ret.), accepted on behalf of their father. And Mr. B. Tony Cotter, Chief Judge of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Ret.), accepted for his father, Major Cotter. The families received certificates and medallions that were created by Saipan Post 3457 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars for the Commemoration of the Liberation of Saipan in 1944. Judge Wiseman made the presentation in his capacity as Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce with the authorization of VFW Post 3457.

Clarification
In the August 15 e-kilili newsletter, we reported that the Northern Mariana Islands Chapter of the American Red Cross was awarded an Emergency Food and Shelter Program grant of $83,070 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Our report was based on information we received from FEMA. Subsequently, the NMI Chapter of the American Red Cross clarified for us that they are only one of the local organizations that comprise a Local Board, the decision-making body that allocates this $83,070 within our community to meet the needs of the hungry and homeless. The NMI ARC is not the direct recipient of this funding. Thanks to ARC for the clarification and for all its good work.
