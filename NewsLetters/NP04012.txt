Currently, Congress is
debating
whether to extend dozens of tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013, as well as those set to expire at the end of this year.
The House has previously voted to make some provisions permanent, while a proposal in the Senate would extend all provisions on a temporary basis.
Those provisions
affecting both individuals and businesses
include such things as premiums for mortgage insurance, expensing and depreciation, charitable contributions, and credits for the construction of energy efficient homes.
After a compromise to make some of the tax provisions permanent was derailed by a veto threat from the White House, the House has proposed a
plan
to temporarily extend more than 50 tax provisions, which would allow taxpayers to utilize these provisions when filing their 2014 tax returns.
