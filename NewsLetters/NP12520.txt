This Just In-President Once Again Unilaterally Altering Obamacare
This afternoon, the Obama Administration announced yet another delay
of
an Obamacare provision.
These selective delays emphasize what
Americans already know-this law is hurting families, it's hurting
businesses, and it's hurting economic growth.
Instead of piecemeal
delays that are timed around elections, let's give everyone a reprieve
from this broken law.
Preventing Deaths and Damage from Windstorms
Every year, emergency response personnel, national and state officials,
and insurance professionals gather together at the National Tornado
Summit
to discuss how to improve disaster preparation, response,
and recovery.
I was honored to be invited this year to discuss a bill
I've introduced to help coordinate windstorm research.
H.R. 1786
would reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program
(NWIRP). I first introduced NWIRP in 2004, to promote research that
helps save lives, reduce injuries, and lessen damage from windstorms.
This is an issue that's been very personal for me since the 1970
tornado that devastated Lubbock.
I was lucky enough to escape
unharmed, but not everyone was so fortunate.
My apartment was
destroyed, and I'll never forget the hours we spent digging through
wreckage and searching for survivors after that storm.
My goal with
NWIRP is to ensure that more buildings can stand up to powerful storms
so we can face fewer injuries and less destruction.
This
reauthorization would make the program more efficient, focusing our
resources on the research and pre-storm planning that allow us to save
lives, homes, and taxpayer dollars.
Not only does this benefit
communities that are hard-hit by tornados, hurricanes, and other
storms, but it also makes better use of taxpayer dollars. For every
dollar we invest in resilience against windstorms, we can reduce
disaster response costs by four times that much.
NWIRP should be up before the Science Committee for a vote soon.
I'm
looking forward to seeing this passed out of Committee and brought to
the House Floor as soon as possible.
National Marriage Week
This week marks the annual celebration of National Marriage Week
, and in nations around the globe, people are
gathering to honor family and commitment to one another.
Dana and I
are celebrating too - we're about to celebrate our 44th wedding
anniversary this June.
Like many Americans, we believe that marriage
is a sacred institution, and we appreciate that stable marriages
benefit children, families, and communities.
That's why I've
cosponsored a federal amendment to the Constitution
to precisely define marriage
as a union between one woman and one man.
You've probably heard of
recent attempts by the Administration and various states to attack the
traditional definition of marriage.
But I assure you that I'm working
in Congress to protect your children, family, and community by
promoting family values across the nation.
Action Item: Celebrating Black History Month
In 1925, historian Carter Woodson started a movement to spend a week
bringing awareness to the role of African Americans in our national
history.
His effort has grown tremendously since then, and for the
past 38 years, we've set aside the month of February to study and honor
how African Americans have contributed to our national culture and
history.
Our nation was founded on the idea that we are all created
equal, which means that we all have the opportunity to pursue our
dreams regardless of our race, our religion, or our gender.
And
although we haven't always lived up to that principle, what makes
America truly great is that we continue to aspire to our highest
ideals.
Black History Month reminds us to study our past, and to
pursue our best possible future together.
I'll be visiting with high school students in Abilene this Friday and
Lubbock next Monday to talk about Black History Month
and what it means to them.
I think we'll
have an interesting discussion-I grew up during the Civil Rights
Movement, and what my peers and I saw as groundbreaking change is all
history to this generation.
I'm looking forward to hearing their
thoughts on how far we've come as a country, and where we must go from
here.

Preventing

Every

emergency
response
personnel,

insurance
professionals
gather
together
at
the

to

This
is
an

devastated
Lubbock.
I
was
lucky

not
everyone
was
so
fortunate.
My
apartment
was

and
I&#8217;ll
never

the

National
Marriage
Week
This
week
marks
the
annual
celebration
of
National
Marriage
Week ,
and
in
nations
around
the
globe,
people
are
gathering
to
honor

Dana

I
are
celebrating
too
&#8211;
we&#8217;re

Like
many
Americans,
we
believe
that
marriage
is
a
sacred

and
we
appreciate
that
stable
marriages
benefit
children,
families,
and

That&#8217;s

I&#8217;ve
cosponsored
a

to
precisely
define

You&#8217;ve
probably
heard
of
recent
attempts
by
the

and
various
states
to

But
I
assure
you
that
I&#8217;m
working
in
Congress
to
protect
your
children,
family,
and
community
by
promoting
family
values
across
the
nation.
Action
Item:
Celebrating
Black
History
Month
In
1925,
historian
Carter
Woodson
started
a
movement
to
spend
a
week
bringing
awareness
to
the
role
of
African
Americans
in
our
national
history.
His
effort
has
grown
tremendously
since
then,
and
for
the
past
38
years,
we&#8217;ve
set
aside
the
month
of
February
to
study
and
honor
how
African
Americans
have
contributed
to
our
national
culture
and
history.
Our
nation
was
founded
on
the
idea
that
we
are
all
created
equal,
which
means
that
we
all
have
the
opportunity
to
pursue
our
dreams
regardless
of
our
race,
our
religion,
or
our
gender.
And
although
we
haven&#8217;t
always
lived
up
to
that
principle,
what
makes
America
truly
great
is
that
we
continue
to
aspire
to
our
highest
ideals.
Black
History
Month
reminds
us
to
study
our
past,
and
to
pursue
our
best
possible
future
together.
I&#8217;ll
be
visiting
with
high
school
students
in
Abilene
this
Friday
and
Lubbock
next
Monday
to
talk
about
Black
History
Month
and
what
it
means
to
them.
I
think
we&#8217;ll
have
an
interesting
discussion&#8212;I
grew
up
during
the
Civil
Rights
Movement,
and
what
my
peers
and
I
saw
as
groundbreaking
change
is
all
history
to
this
generation.
I&#8217;m
looking
forward
to
hearing
their
thoughts
on
how
far
we&#8217;ve
come
as
a
country,
and
where
we
must
go
from
here.
