&ldquo;Republicans chances of winning the Senate keep getting better&rdquo; -
Washington Post , 10/20/2014
Dear Friend,
The bad news -- the really bad news -- is that both
FiveThirtyEight
and the
New York Times
just upped the Republicans&rsquo; odds of taking over the Senate.
The good news is that Democrats are moving in the right direction in a couple key states -- states where no one expected us to be competitive.
According to Nate Silver and the
Times , Kansas is in play, which no one could have predicted even a few weeks ago.
Democrats are the underdogs, but if we all keep fighting together, we can win.
Our final monthly goal of the election is looming just 12 days away. Can you contribute $5 or more to get us there?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
We know what&rsquo;s in front of us. We know what we need to do to support Democrats up and down the ballot this year.
This election -- both here in the Commonwealth and across the nation -- will come down to who works harder and who organizes smarter. Our ability to put organizers in the field depends on your contributions. There are 12 days until the election. We have to be the ones working harder. If you can, give $5 toward the $16O,OOO we need this month to keep working.
Thank you.
