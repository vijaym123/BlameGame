Rep. Bob Goodlatte
With the work of the
114th Congress underway, you can also follow along with what's happening in Washington as well as my stops in the Sixth District by following me on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Removing Bureaucracy from
Higher Education
Why does federal bureaucracy need a bigger role in higher education? This is the question many of us are
asking as the Obama Administration continues to propose policies that further government intrusion into our education system. Ensuring the opportunity
for a quality education is important to America&rsquo;s future. However, we have seen that more federal government in education means more ineffective
policies that ultimately lack critical flexibility and decision-making power needed by individual states, schools, educators, parents, and
students.
Rather
than just working to comply with federal mandates, schools should
instead be working to meet the
needs of students. We should not tighten
the grip of bureaucracy on higher education.
Read more in my weekly column
on some of the Obama Administration's
latest plans impacting higher education, including a proposed new tax on college savings plans that many families use to help save for college
today.
Why We March
On Thursday, I was honored to welcome a group
from the Shenandoah Valley to Washington for the annual March for Life held on the
anniversary of the
Roe v. Wade
decision
that legalized abortion in the United States.
On the same
day, the House passed the
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act
(H.R. 7), which permanently frees taxpayers from subsidizing abortion or
insurance coverage that includes abortion. As a country, we must speak for those who cannot speak for themselves and allow them the fundamental human
right to be born into this world. The passage of the
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act
is just one step towards the protection of life
that I enthusiastically support.
