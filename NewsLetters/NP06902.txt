David -- I'm sitting here in Schneider HQ and something
AMAZING
is happening. Since Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s inspiring call-to-action, over
921 supporters
from Illinois and around the country have chipped in for Brad.
SENSATIONAL!!!
If we can hit 1,OOO donations by midnight, it&rsquo;ll be a
STUNNING comeback
for us and send a loud and clear message to Karl Rove.
David, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to respond to Nancy&rsquo;s email. Don&rsquo;t worry -- there&rsquo;s still time!
Just use one of these links to pitch in before midnight:
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
No regrets, Tracy Mayfield
