Washington should play by the same rules as the rest of America: Balance your budget. Don't spend more than you make. Following the law is not optional. Problem solving takes focus and team work.
These are principles most of us were taught by our parents as children. They're second nature to us, and part of the fabric of our lives. The same should be true for our government. It is indisputable that, as a nation, we face a number of complex issues with myriads of nuances and consequences to consider; nevertheless, just as many issues - including the dysfunction in Washington - could be solved by applying a little common sense.
Some of the common sense solutions I'm working on are my 414 Plan,
H.R. 4153 , (to cut useless red tape, accelerate the building of roads and bridges, and put Americans back to work); The Patients First Act,
H.R. 1740 , (to prioritize medical research with proven success); and the CAP Act,
H.R. 3136 , (to hold Washington directly accountable for overspending by tying Members of Congress' salaries to government spending - the more they spend, the less they make.) Read more,
here.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder announced his resignation. Many Americans were not sad to see him go, as they have been rightly questioning the lack of accountability of this Administration, particularly at the Department of Justice.
The American people deserve a new Attorney General who is committed to accountability, transparency, and the rule of law.
