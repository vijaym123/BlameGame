Assisting Tennessee Families
Unable to Bring Their Children Home from
DRC
In a letter to the president and prime minister of the Democratic
Republic of Congo this week, Senator Corker joined congressional leaders
in requesting an end to delays in processing the adoptions of 460
Congolese children by American families. The bipartisan letter, signed by
more than 170 lawmakers from the Senate and House of Representatives,
asks the Congolese government to expedite the process for children
with health risks and to issue exit permits for adoptions that were
approved prior to September 25, 2013 or were finalized on or after that
date.
It is in this spirit of goodwill and respect that we,
the undersigned Members of the United States Congress, write to ask
for your help in resolving the over 460 adoption cases of Congolese
children who either have been adopted or are in the process of being
adopted by American families, yet who are unable to obtain exit permits
due to a recent DRC suspension, wrote Corker and other congressional
leaders. While we work together to ensure that all Congolese children
are protected, we hope you will consider allowing the hundreds of
American families who have legally completed the adoption process to move
forward. The unexpected delay in the completion of these adoptions has
resulted in over 460 children continuing to languish in institutions
without the care of a permanent family.
Advocacy groups
indicate at least 23 families in Tennessee are affected by the DRCs
halt on adoptions. Senator Corkers office has heard from a number of
them who remain unable to bring their adopted children home. In addition
to meeting with State Department officials, including the U.S.
ambassador, and the ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Corkers
staff also has met with several families in various stages of the
adoption process and continues to see how to provide further assistance
that will eventually bring these children to the United
States.

Obama Administrations Response to
Russias Intervention in Ukraine a Day Late and a Dollar
Short
Click Image to Watch
Video
Appearing on CNNs The Lead with Jake Tapper yesterday, Senator
Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
the Obama administrations response to Russias intervention in Ukraine
has been a day late and a dollar short.
I think the
administration has created this air of permissiveness, said Corker.
What we did in Syria, by jumping into Russias lap and letting them
drive policy there after the chemical weapons issue came to the
forefront, has really been informative, I think, to the people of Russia and,
candidly, our allies, and I think [Russia is] in fact playing us
instead of us moving ahead with sectoral sanctions, which weve been urging
[the Obama administration] to do to push back on Russia. Instead, we
continue to watch what [Russia is] doing and try to respond to that.
But it seems that in doing so we create a policy that is always a day
late and a dollar short and we dont have the desired outcome that wed
like to see happen for our nation.

Obama
Administration Makes Every Excuse Imaginable to Delay Keystone XL
Pipeline Decision
Senator Corker
issued the following statement on the Obama administrations announcement
that it will delay again its decision on the Keystone XL
pipeline:
Its amazing to watch this administration make every
excuse imaginable to delay a project that is unquestionably a win for our
country, our economy and American workers, said Corker. After more
than five years of environmental reviews, its clear the president would
rather avoid a tough political decision than create thousands of
private sector jobs and enhance our countrys energy security, all while
providing a safer and more environmentally friendly method of
transporting oil.
