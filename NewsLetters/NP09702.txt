Dear Friends:
I wanted to send a quick note out today to wish
all the moms out there in the 12 th
District a Happy Mothers
Day.
As youre gathering together with
your family today, or if youre just relaxing at home, I hope you know how much
you mean to your family.
Today, Im thinking about my Mother, who for 24
years taught over 9,000 students at the University of Georgia.
Im still
amazed at the number of people who come up to me who took Moms class at
UGA.
I learned the value of public service from my Mom, who was the first
graduate from the University of Georgia to enlist in the Womens Army Corps
during World War II.
I know the profound
impact she had on my life, but its wonderful to meet people everywhere I go whose
lives she touched as well.
Her memory lives on through them, and that
makes
this
son very proud.
Whether youre gathering with family today,
resting, or thinking about great memories of your mom, please keep those moms
who are serving our country in your thoughts and prayers.
Days like today are especially difficult for
them and their families, and we wish them all a safe return home.
I hope you all have a Happy Mothers Day!
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
P.S.
And for those of you who are lucky enough to still have your moms with you
make sure she gets a little rest and relaxation today.
You know shes earned it!
