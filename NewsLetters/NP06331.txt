Wicker: Political Posturing
Distracts
From National Challenges
Democrat
Proposal to Limit Free Speech Is Ill-Timed
Amid
Concerns About the Economy,
ISIS
After a month of visiting with Mississippians, I returned
to Washington with a clear picture of the concerns and challenges
facing our state.
I learned from meeting with small business owners
and their employees that it is getting more difficult to make a living
in America.
I heard from our military leaders why defense cuts
could negatively impact troop readiness.
I spoke to new Job
Corps graduates, who have prepared for skilled careers but enter an
unpredictable job market.
It is baffling, then, that Democratic Majority Leader Harry
Reid (Nev.) is focusing the current Senate agenda on a proposal limiting
First Amendment rights.
Issues like job creation and the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) should be at the forefront of the
Senate's attention
not Democrats' political posturing before the
November elections.
Senate Democrats Undermine the Bill of
Rights
Specifically, Senate
Democrats seek a constitutional amendment that would allow government
officials to regulate political speech.
The measure is described as
campaign finance reform, but it could lead to the censorship of
books, television reports, and other political messages that government
officials dislike.
It could ultimately undermine the free speech
protections granted to all Americans in the Constitution's Bill of
Rights.
In a republic, Senators are
elected to make policy decisions on behalf of the people they represent.
Addressing the public's most pressing concerns is part of this
responsibility.
Like many of my colleagues, I am frustrated
that the concerns I hear from Mississippians every day are not the
debates happening on the Senate
floor.
A Backlog of Jobs
Bills
The latest jobs
report reaffirms the negative impact of the economy on American lives.
Although the unemployment rate has inched downward, the month of
August had the fewest job gains of the year.
Meanwhile, the number
of Americans who have been jobless for more than six months remains
too high, and the percentage of those who have given up looking for work
or want full-time employment is still well above pre-recession
levels.
There are a number of
opportunities to change these statistics.
The House of
Representatives has passed dozens of jobs bills that are waiting for Senate
approval.
Instead of trying to score political points, Majority
Leader Reid should allow debate on these bills and work to build bipartisan
agreement on job-creating solutions.
Political votes to repeal
part of the First Amendment do nothing to put Americans back to work
or boost economic growth.
Focusing on
Defense
Further exposing the mismatch
between Senate Democrats' agenda and the concerns of the country is the
volatile situation in the Middle East.
On September 10, the
President addressed the nation about the threat of ISIS and how the United
States would respond.
The remarks were a welcome change after
months of mixed messages by the White House downplaying the capabilities
of the terrorist group.
And yet, the Democrat-controlled Senate
has failed to send the country's major defense legislation, the
"National Defense Authorization Act," to the President to become
law.
Congress has an obligation to address
the issues of the day, from joblessness to national security. Majority
Leader Reid ought to stop ignoring national priorities and using
partisan tactics only aimed at getting votes in November.
It is past
time for the Senate to get serious about delivering solutions to the
problems that affect Americans' daily lives.
