A Step Forward
Dear Friend,
I was thrilled to learn of FEMA's decision this week to award a
much-needed grant to the Yarnell Fire District, which will facilitate
their ability to fight wildfires. Although we're still mourning the
terrible losses suffered during the tragic Yarnell Hill Fire, our
community must rebuild. The rebuilding process makes it necessary to
recruit and hire firefighters, who will shoulder this particularly
dangerous form of public service, and this grant will assist in these
efforts.
For these reasons and more, I was proud to write FEMA in support of
Yarnell's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER)
Grant application. As the Yarnell Fire District battles dangerous
wildfires on federal lands, it's only appropriate that they receive
additional federal assistance. I will continue to support efforts that
ensure our first responders have the resources necessary to accomplish
their missions while also maintaining their safety. I'm truly grateful
for all they do to keep our communities safe. Click HERE

Fighting for Work
On Thursday, I announced my co-sponsorship of the Save American Workers
Act, which would repeal ObamaCare's new definition of full time
employment as 30-hours and restore the traditional 40-hour definition.
The botched rollout of ObamaCare made clear this law is broken and
needs to be repealed and replaced. ObamaCare reduces full-time
employment hours, raises taxes, interferes with the fundamental
doctor-patient relationship, causes premiums to skyrocket and
eliminates health insurance plans that millions of Americans were
promised they could keep.
Thanks to ObamaCare redefining the traditional work week as 30 hours,
millions of Americans are losing income upon which they desperately
depend. Single mothers, recent college graduates and low-income
families are forced to pick up second jobs just to make ends meet.
Ironically, changing the definition of full-time employment to 30-hours
is forcing people to work more, not less, because they need multiple
jobs.
There was a time when our country fought to limit work to 40 hours per
week, now we're fighting just to get 40 hours of work. This legislation
is simple; all it does is change the definition of a full-time work
week back to 40 hours. Consequently, it allows hardworking Americans to
keep more disposable income in their pockets and prevents them from
being forced to take on another job just to make the equivalent amount
that they made under a 40-hour work week. Click HERE

The Federal Government Gets an 'F'
Friday I announced my co-sponsorship of the Common Core Resolution,
legislation that strongly denounces President Obama's attempt to coerce
states into adopting Common Core by instituting preferences in federal
grants and flexibility waivers.
As a father, I know that a good education is critical to every child's
success. This is a key reason why I vehemently oppose national
standards. One size doesn't fit all. Adopting national standards leads
to national tests, which in turn lead to the establishment of a
national curriculum and teachers simply teaching for the test. When it
comes to running federal programs, the federal government gets an 'F,'
making national standards a recipe for disaster. Involvement by the
federal government in education only disrupts the fundamental
relationship between students, parents and teachers. Bureaucrats in
Washington, D.C. don't know the educational needs of students in Yuma,
Buckeye or Kingman.
Furthermore, the Constitution is very clear: responsibilities not
specifically granted to the federal government, or prohibited to the
states, are left to the states and the people. In light of this, the
federal government should not coerce states into adopting national
standards. Education is most effectively handled at the local and state
level by empowering teachers, parents, school boards and local
communities to make decisions on education matters; this is the only
constitutional way to deliver these services. Click HERE

The

made
clear
this

is
broken
and
needs
to
be
repealed
and

ObamaCare
reduces
full-time

raises

doctor-patient

causes
premiums
to
skyrocket
and
eliminates
health

plans
that
millions
of
Americans
were
promised
they
could
keep.
Thanks
to
ObamaCare
redefining
the
traditional
work
week
as
30
hours,
millions
of
Americans
are
losing
income
upon
which
they
desperately

legislation
is
simple;
all
it
does
is
change
the

back

Consequently,
it
allows
hardworking
Americans
to
keep

The

Gets
an

Friday
I
announced my
co-sponsorship

the
Common

that
strongly
denounces

Obama&#8217;s
