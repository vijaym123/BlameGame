Dear Friends,
Id like to thank the several thousand Central Valley residents who joined me and other Members of Congress on Wednesday for a water rally in Fresno. It was a great, energized
crowd, and it sent a loud and clear message to the Senate, the Governor, the President, and the nation that we cant wait any longer for action on the water crisis. Afterward, the House Natural Resources Committee held a field hearing on the crisis before
a standing-room only audience.
You can read my opening remarks from the hearing
here , and listen to Ray Appleton, John Batchelor, and I discuss the days events
here .
