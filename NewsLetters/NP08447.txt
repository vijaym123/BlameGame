"I was pleased to hear of the
successful missile defense test conducted by the Missile Defense Agency,
the Air Force, and other joint partners over the weekend. As Co-Chair of
the Missile Defense Caucus and from my position on the Strategic
Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, I have always
been a strong advocate for missile defense and making sure that the
Fifth Congressional District is a central hub in our missile defense
network. This recent test was conducted under the purview of Northern
Command (based out of Peterson AFB). The great joint team at Schriever
AFB's Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center did important
work on this effort as well. This technology is a vital tool to deter
external threats and protect America from
aggression."
