Dear David,
With Labor Day approaching, I wanted to take a
moment to acknowledge the remarkable contributions that American
workers have made to help make this country great. Our workers are the best
in the world, and nowhere is that more evident than right here in
Rochester. Products developed and manufactured by our friends and
neighbors helped transform the twentieth century, and now the Rochester area
is positioned to be a center of innovation for the
future.
When it comes to supporting U.S. workers and a strong middle class, the
federal government should lead by example. That's why Buy American
laws are so important. Buy American simply says that the federal
government should purchase American-made goods whenever possible. From the
equipment used by our Armed Forces to the steel used to build bridges
and other infrastructure, these policies ensure that our tax dollars are
invested back in U.S. workers.
Buy American laws were
first instituted in the 1930s, but they have been slowly chipped away over
the years through free trade agreements such as NAFTA. The latest of
these is known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is being
negotiated between the United States and eleven other countries around
the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP would give businesses in places like
Vietnam and Malaysia the same access as American companies to U.S.
government purchases and contracts, meaning our tax dollars are at risk
of being used to create jobs in other countries instead of our
own.
I think that would be a bad deal for American workers, and so
I recently joined more than a hundred of my congressional colleagues
in calling on our top trade officials to demand that the TPP not erode
important, long-standing protections like Buy American.
This
Labor Day, I'm reminded that our workers deserve nothing
less.
Best,
Rochester
