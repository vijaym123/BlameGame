Happy Independence
Day!
On this 4th of July weekend, I
reflected on the many blessings we share as a nation. We live in a country
where liberty and freedom are celebrated and serve as a beacon of hope
to the world. I am forever grateful to the men and women who served to
defend and protect the liberties we hold so dear. God bless you and
God bless the United States.
Making Sure Our Veterans Have the
Medical Care They Deserve
Making sure that our veterans have the proper medical care that
they deserve is of the utmost importance. I recently introduced a
bipartisan bill along with Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), that will help address wait
times at Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals by boosting the number of VA
doctors. The Doctors Helping Heroes Act would allow foreign doctors
trained in the U.S. to extend visas to practice at VA hospitals and
underserved rural communities. The nation is currently projected to have
a shortage of 63,000 doctors by 2015 and more than 130,000 by 2025,
according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. You can read
more about the bill

Fighting Terror: Hezbollah Sanctions Bill Gains
Momentum
My
bill, The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of
2014,
H.R. 4411 , advanced through the House Foreign
Affairs Committee. The bipartisan legislation seeks to cripple the
terrorist organization's vast network of illegal financing. The bill has
wide support from the majority of the House of Representatives with 315
co-sponsors. The next step will be for the bill to be taken up for a
vote on the House floor. You can read more about it
