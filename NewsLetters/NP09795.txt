An OpEd by Reps. Tammy Duckworth and Kristi Noem.
The remarkable thing about both our mothers is that no matter the
situation, they did everything they could, they sacrificed, they put
themselves aside so we could have more opportunities and greater joy.
Last Mother's Day, we were more than 7,000 miles from these incredible
women, spending our time instead with those who serve our country in
the Middle East.
During our travels, we met a young military mother.
She was energetic,
smart, and an extremely dedicated Soldier and parent.
With tears in
her eyes, she told us her story, which has stuck with us ever since.
We wrapped our arms around her, but knew all she wanted that Mother's
Day was to be with her baby.
For most moms, going back to work after having a child is one of the
most difficult days professionally.
But when this woman went back to
work, she didn't put on a business suit; she put on fatigues.
She
didn't jump in her car; she walked onto a plane and prepared to deploy
overseas.
Just weeks after giving birth to her beautiful new baby, she strapped
on her boots and left for a destination halfway around the world,
knowing she wouldn't return until her baby was at least nine months
old.
It's difficult to imagine how tough that first day must have been
- emotionally and physically.
Military moms, like the one we met on our trip, face many of the same
challenges working mothers do.
They must figure out how to juggle a
schedule that's packed with work commitments, basketball games, and
trips to the grocery store.
They struggle to maximize each minute at
home.
And unfortunately, they fight the perception that because they
work, they are less devoted to their family.
Mothers in the military, however, undoubtedly face a number of unique
challenges as well.
Most notably, as Army First Lieutenant Jessica
Scott writes, military moms "must also face the fact that by remaining
in the military, we may never see our sons and daughters again..Before
each mother deploys, she must make all the final preparations in case
she doesn't come home."
Deployment is difficult for any parent - for any Soldier - but for a
mother who endured childbirth just weeks before, there are additional
physical and mental challenges that must be overcome.
Today, the Defense Department offers active-duty mothers 42 days of
maternity leave before they must return to their assignment.
This is
six weeks less than civilian employees are entitled to under the Family
and Medical Leave Act.
Women who have volunteered to serve our country
in the military deserve adequate time to recover from childbirth.
Numerous studies have shown that women who take at least 12 weeks of
leave after childbirth show fewer symptoms of depression.
Their
physical health, an imperative attribute for a service member, is also
increased.
Moreover, their child is less likely to have long-term
cognitive and behavioral issues.
Understanding all this, we introduced the Military Opportunities for
Moms Act - affectionately known as the MOM Act - last week.
This bill
allows for an additional six weeks of leave time for moms in the
military.
Like in many civilian positions, the leave would be unpaid.
Today, thousands of mothers play critical roles within our military.
They are serving with distinction in Afghanistan and at duty posts
around the world.
They are an irreplaceable piece of the strongest and
most capable military in the world, so it seems to us that extending
maternity leave for these women is the least we can do for those who
not only sacrificed for their children, but sacrificed for our country.

Tammy Duckworth

Kristi Noem

An
OpEd
by
Reps.
Tammy
Duckworth
and
Kristi
Noem.
The
remarkable
thing
about
both
our
mothers
is
that
no
matter
the
situation,
they
did
everything
they
could,
they
sacrificed,
they
put
themselves
aside
so
we
could
have
more
opportunities
and
greater
joy.
Last
Mother&#8217;s
Day,
we
were
more
than
7,000
miles
from
these
incredible
women,
spending
our
time
instead
with
those
who
serve
our
country
in
the
Middle
East.
During
our
travels,
we
met
a
young
military
mother.
She
was
energetic,
smart,
and
an
extremely
dedicated
Soldier
and
parent.
With
tears
in
her
eyes,
she
told
us
her
story,
which
has
stuck
with
us
ever
since.
We
wrapped
our
arms
around
her,
but
knew
all
she
wanted
that
Mother&#8217;s
Day
was
to
be
with
her
baby.
For
most
moms,
going
back
to
work
after
having
a
child
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
days
professionally.
But
when
this
woman
went
back
to
work,
she
didn&#8217;t
put
on
a
business
suit;
she
put
on
fatigues.
She
didn&#8217;t
jump
in
her
car;
she
walked
onto
a
plane
and
prepared
to
deploy
overseas.
Just
weeks
after
giving
birth
to
her
beautiful
new
baby,
she
strapped
on
her
boots
and
left
for
a
destination
halfway
around
the
world,
knowing
she
wouldn&#8217;t
return
until
her
baby
was
at
least
nine
months
old.
It&#8217;s
difficult
to
imagine
how
tough
that
first
day
must
have
been
&#8211;
emotionally
and
physically.
Military
moms,
like
the
one
we
met
on
our
trip,
face
many
of
the
same
challenges
working
mothers
do.
They
must
figure
out
how
to
juggle
a
schedule
that&#8217;s
packed
with
work
commitments,
basketball
games,
and
trips
to
the
grocery
store.
They
struggle
to
maximize
each
minute
at
home.
And
unfortunately,
they
fight
the
perception
that
because
they
work,
they
are
less
devoted
to
their
family.
Mothers
in
the
military,
however,
undoubtedly
face
a
number
of
unique
challenges
as
well.
Most
notably,
as
Army
First
Lieutenant
Jessica
Scott
writes,
military
moms
&#8220;must
also
face
the
fact
that
by
remaining
in
the
military,
we
may
never
see
our
sons
and
daughters
again&#8230;.Before
each
mother
deploys,
she
must
make
all
the
final
preparations
in
case
she
doesn&#8217;t
come
home.&#8221;
Deployment
is
difficult
for
any
parent
&#8211;
for
any
Soldier
&#8211;
but
for
a
mother
who
endured
childbirth
just
weeks
before,
there
are
additional
physical
and
mental
challenges
that
must
be
overcome.
Today,
the
Defense
Department
offers
active-duty
mothers
42
days
of
maternity
leave
before
they
must
return
to
their
assignment.
This
is
six
weeks
less
than
civilian
employees
are
entitled
to
under
the
Family
and
Medical
Leave
Act.
Women
who
have
volunteered
to
serve
our
country
in
the
military
deserve
adequate
time
to
recover
from
childbirth.
Numerous
studies
have
shown
that
women
who
take
at
least
12
weeks
of
leave
after
childbirth
show
fewer
symptoms
of
depression.
Their
physical
health,
an
imperative
attribute
for
a
service
member,
is
also
increased.
Moreover,
their
child
is
less
likely
to
have
long-term
cognitive
and
behavioral
issues.
Understanding
all
this,
we
introduced
the
Military
Opportunities
for
Moms
Act
&#8211;
affectionately
known
as
the
MOM
Act
&#8211;
last
week.
This
bill
allows
for
an
additional
six
weeks
of
leave
time
for
moms
in
the
military.
Like
in
many
civilian
positions,
the
leave
would
be
unpaid.
Today,
thousands
of
mothers
play
critical
roles
within
our
military.
They
are
serving
with
distinction
in
Afghanistan
and
at
duty
posts
around
the
world.
They
are
an
irreplaceable
piece
of
the
strongest
and
most
capable
military
in
the
world,
so
it
seems
to
us
that
extending
maternity
leave
for
these
women
is
the
least
we
can
do
for
those
who
not
only
sacrificed
for
their
children,
but
sacrificed
for
our
country.

Tammy
Duckworth
