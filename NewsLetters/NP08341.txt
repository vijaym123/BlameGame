Brad needs our help
David --
Boehner&rsquo;s scrambling.
In fact, his campaign arm just reserved
$3O,OOO,OOO
of airtime targeting Democrats in battleground races across the country.
I don&rsquo;t care how you spin it -- that&rsquo;s a lot of money -- and it could be devastating to our campaigns.
Boehner knows that Brad&rsquo;s a tireless champion for Illinois&rsquo;s middle class families. He&rsquo;s desperate to replace him with a run-of-the-mill Republican.
Brad&rsquo;s always fought for us. Now, it&rsquo;s time to fight for him. Will you chip in $5 or more for Brad before the critical June 30th fundraising deadline?
A lot is at stake right now. Please don&rsquo;t let Brad fall short.
Thank you,
Nancy
