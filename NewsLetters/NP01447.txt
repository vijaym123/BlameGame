Next Week: 2015 Congressional Art Competition Submission Deadline
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) invites all interested high school students to participate in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. In keeping with a tradition that began in 1982, the annual art competition provides high school students who reside in the Fourth Congressional District with the unique opportunity of having their artwork exhibited in the United States Capitol.
Students wishing to participate must submit their artwork no later than Wednesday, April 22, 2015. All entries must be sent to one of Congressman Forbes district offices in Chesterfield or Chesapeake, along with the appropriate forms.
Every year, as my offices start receiving art entries, I enjoy seeing the different creations our students have come up with, Forbes said, The talent is apparent, but I am also always impressed by how varied and unique each piece is
as varied and unique as the students themselves. To be able to showcase these young Fourth District artists skill and hard work through the Congressional Art Competition is always an honor.
Every year, each Member of Congress is given the opportunity to choose one piece of artwork created by a highschooler in their Congressional District to display in the Cannon Tunnel, a path tread daily by hundreds of visitors, staffers, and Members of Congress as they make their way to the U.S. Capitol. The winner from the Fourth District will also be invited to Washington, D.C. to meet Congressman Forbes and attend the annual unveiling ceremony in June.
Last years winner from Virginias Fourth Congressional District was Sarah Crockett, of Midlothian, who submitted a self-portrait.
Additional information is available on Congressman Forbes website at

Students can also contact Meggie Trusty in Congressman Forbes Washington D.C. office at (202) 225-6365 for more information.
