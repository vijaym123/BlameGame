Friends,
This past week in the House, I joined my colleagues in passing several pieces of legislation intended to
STOP Government Abuse
and rein in out-of-control executive branch agencies.
A few of the bills we passed:
H.R. 3865 - Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014
H.R. 3308 - Taxpayer Transparency Act of 2013
H.R. 1944 - Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2013
Do you believe your tax dollars should be used for government advertisements? Does the IRS need to know what your religious, political or social beliefs are? Should government agencies be required to provide report cards to taxpayers on the programs they operate?
Take my survey
below to share your thoughts on these questions and more.
And as always, I welcome your feedback, and I encourage you to connect using my
website ,
twitter , and
facebook .
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
Do you believe more should be done to rein in government abuse?
