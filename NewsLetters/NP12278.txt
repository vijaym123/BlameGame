Friends,
Our long-anticipated interim report on the Benghazi attacks
from the House Armed Services Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations was released on Tuesday. As the former
chairman of the subcommittee, I was directly responsible for overseeing
the investigation, and I am proud of the work that was done.
I went on Fox News to discuss some of the findings from our report with
Megyn Kelly. You can watch the video online at www.youtube.com/RepRoby
.
Washington's lack of preparedness and uninformed notion of the threat
level left our commanders in the region in an impossible position. And,
because of that, I'm convinced that no heroic effort on the part of our
troops could have changed the horrific outcome of the Benghazi attack.
Testimony revealed that, when the White House sent out a press release
on September 10, 2012 assuring Americans we were prepared for the
anniversary of 9/11, it did so without having consulted the commanders
in the North Africa region.
To quote the report
, "In assessing military posture in
anticipation of the September 11 anniversary, White House officials
failed to comprehend or ignored the dramatically deteriorating security
situation in Libya and the growing threat to U.S. interests in the
region. Official public statements seem to have exaggerated the extent
and rigor of the security assessment conducted at the time."
Our report complement's the Senate Intelligence Committee's recent
report that criticized State Department officials for not heeding
warnings from our intelligence community leading up to September 11.
These lapses are unacceptable. While multiple government agencies and
military branches had responsibilities relating to the Benghazi
attacks, there is only one Commander-in-Chief. It is his responsibility
to ensure cooperation and coordination among military, intelligence and
diplomatic officials, particularly in such a dangerous part of the
world on a uniquely dangerous day.
There are many other questions that remain about Benghazi, particularly
those relating to the State Department and the White House. Some of
those questions fall to other committees in Congress, and I am pleased
that my colleagues on these committees are continuing their pursuit of
answers. We will continue to seek the truth about the attacks that
killed four Americans, including our U.S. Ambassador.
Restoring Military Retiree Pension Benefits
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a plan to repeal cuts
to cost-of-living increases for military pensions
. You may remember that last December Congress passed and the
president signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which set
a sustainable path for federal spending over the next two years.
Unfortunately, part of the budget savings came from reducing the
percentage of cost-of-living pension increases for working-age military
retirees. That is why I immediately set out to right this wrong and
change this unfair provision while finding budget savings elsewhere.
Different ways to fix the problem were discussed, but ultimately the
House passed legislation that repeals the military pension cuts and
replaces the budget savings by extending reductions to mandatory
federal spending through 2024.
This country made promises to our men and women in uniform, and we must
keep those promises. I was glad the House acted to right a wrong and
restore the promised cost-of-living pension increases for military
retirees. The Senate also passed the bill, and it now awaits President
Obama's signature.

There

Restoring
Military
Retiree
Pension
Benefits
On
Tuesday,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
plan
to
repeal
cuts
to
cost-of-living
increases
for
military
pensions .
You
may
remember
that
last
December
Congress
passed
and
the
president
signed
into
law
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013,
which
set
a
sustainable
path
for
federal
spending
over
the
next
two
years.
Unfortunately,
part
of
the
budget
savings
came
from
reducing
the
percentage
of
cost-of-living
pension
increases
for
working-age
military
retirees.
That
is
why
I
immediately
set
out
to
right
this
wrong
and
change
this
unfair
provision
while
finding
budget
savings
elsewhere. Different
ways
to
fix
the

were
discussed,
but
ultimately
the
House
passed
legislation
that
repeals
the
military

and
replaces
the
budget
savings
by
extending
reductions
to
mandatory
federal
spending
through
2024.
This
country
made
promises
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform,
and
we
must
keep
those
promises.
I
was
glad
the
House
acted
to
right
a
wrong
and
restore
the
promised
cost-of-living
pension
increases
for
military
retirees.
The
Senate
also
passed
the
bill,
and
it
now

President
Obama&#8217;s
signature.
