President urged to support programs important to the Northern Marianas in FY15
As the President makes the final decisions on his fiscal year 2015 budget proposal, Members of Congress work together to encourage the President to fund the programs important to our constituents at the levels we think are necessary. Increased funding for the Title I education and special education grants that are crucial to our Public School System students and teachers, port and harbor project funding for the Army Corps of Engineers, more money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), weatherization, and state energy grants that help lower power costs are among the programs I have supported. I also took the lead in writing to the President to boost funding for technical assistance grants administered by the Office of Insular Affairs. The Presidents budget is usually delivered to Congress on the first Monday of February, but it has been delayed until early March this year because of the government shutdown last October.

Congress repeals cut to military retiree COLA
Veterans and current service members will be eligible again for a cost of living increase in their retirement pay. Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill this week to repeal caps on annual retirement increases that had been put in place by Decembers Ryan-Murray budget deal. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), who chair the House and Senate Budget Committees, respectively, agreed to reduce the annual COLA by 1 percent below inflation for working age retirees beginning at the end of 2015. The COLA cap was estimated to save $6 billion over 10 years. The bill approved this week offsets that lost saving by extending the current sequester on Medicare spending to 2024. The bill now goes to the President, who is expected to sign it into law.

USDA to host cover crop forum on Saipan
The U.S. Department of Agricultures Natural Resources Conservation Service is planning a forum on how to maintain and improve soil health on Northern Marianas farmlands. The event, to be held on Saipan, February 17th to 19th, is one of 225 taking place around the country in concert with the National Conference on Cover Crops and Soil Health in Omaha, Nebraska. The local forum will bring together farmers and those interested in conservation to learn how to stop soil erosion, manage pests, and improve crop yields using cover crops. Anyone interested in learning more or signing up for the program may contact the NRSC office in Garapan or call Mr. Kendall Hicks at (670) 233-3415, ext. 100.

Give diplomacy a chance on Iran nukes
Families in the Northern Mariana Islands, as in every part of America, have paid a heavy price because of the conflicts in the Middle East. We have lost loved ones. Those who returned to us were often injured. And we still have Americans in harms way in this dangerous part of the world. So it is heartening to see that our country is making some progress toward a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iranian nuclear weapon development. The world will be far more dangerous if Iran obtains this capacity. I know that there is every reason to be wary of the Iranian regime and its true intentions in the current negotiations, but the benefits of finding resolution through diplomacy justify the effort. I joined other Members of Congress this week
in communicating these views to the President and urging him to continue pursuing this course, while remaining committed to keeping nuclear weapons out of Iranian hands.
