Give the Gift of Health
As 2013 comes to a close, I would like to wish each and every one of you a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and best wishes as we head into a new year together. San Francisco is rarely as beautiful or as festive as it is in the winter &ndash; when children ice skate on the Embarcadero and lights adorn palm trees and fir trees alike. While you gather with your loved ones to celebrate the season, please be sure to stay safe, healthy, and warm.
In the spirit of staying healthy in the New Year, please consider giving the
gift of health
this season, and help any uninsured friends and loved ones you may have to find affordable, quality health care. Having happy, healthy friends and family truly is the gift that keeps on giving.
Please feel free to
