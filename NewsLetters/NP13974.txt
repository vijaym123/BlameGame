UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA - - - - -
November 25, 2013
Dear
Friend:
Late last week, AllenCo
notified
me that it has heeded my call to suspend operations at its oil
and gas pumping facility in the University Park neighborhood of Los
Angeles.
I first called for this action earlier this month when I
learned that residents in the community, including children, had
reported terrible chemical odors and experienced severe health
impacts.
I am pleased that AllenCo has suspended operations at its
University Park facility.
People in the community, including
children, have reported experiencing dizziness, headaches, respiratory
ailments, and recurring nosebleeds.
I commend AllenCo for taking
responsible steps to ensure that local residents will not continue to
suffer.
On November 8th, I visited the University Park
neighborhood and held a
press conference
with local
residents.
At that time, I called for suspension of operations,
and I am pleased that AllenCo has responded so quickly and
clearly.
I am very touched by the tone of Mr. Allens letter and
called him personally to thank him.
I am very optimistic this will
be a new day for this community which has suffered so
much.
Sincerely,
Barbara
Boxer
United States Senator
