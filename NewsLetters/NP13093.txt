Salmon's Statement on President's Changes to Signal Intelligence
Activities
Washington-Today, Rep. Matt Salmon (AZ-05) released the following
statement regarding the President's announced changes to the National
Security Agency's (NSA) phone-data collection program:
"While I appreciate these steps, I remain concerned about the privacy
rights of American citizens.
"I believe we must err on the side of freedom. The NSA's collection of
domestic data on U.S. citizens must be limited in scope and related to
a duly authorized investigation. This would allow our national security
community the tools they need to fight the ever-changing battle against
terrorism, while preserving our constitutional rights.
"I agree with the President that Congress does have a role. That is why
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3361, USA FREEDOM Act, that would reform and
rewrite the Patriot Act. Protecting U.S. civil liberties and our
constitutional right to due process is not up for debate. It is
important to clarify our laws and ensure these protections for U.S.
citizens are never infringed upon, while still meeting our national
security needs.
"As we've seen this past year from multiple NSA leaks, the federal
government collects phone records and intercepts electronic
communications on a scale previously unknown to most Americans. The
lesson is clear: we must remain vigilant to ensure that law abiding
Americans' information isn't needlessly swept up into a government
database and that Congress can fulfil its duty of oversight, enacting
enact sound laws and fixing broken ones."
Privacy for American citizens remains a top priority of Rep. Salmon. He
is a sponsor/cosponsor of the following legislation:
Sponsor of H.R. 1847, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
Amendments Act of 2013, a bill designed to increase protections for
electronic communications, including personal emails, of U.S. citizens.
His bill addresses the privacy concerns raised from the recent position
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that the Fourth Amendment does
not protect the privacy of personal emails because internet users do
not "have a reasonable expectation of privacy in such communications."
The Senate companion, S. 607, is sponsored by Senator Lee (R-UT) and
Chairman Leahy (D-VT). More information about this bill can be found
here
.
Cosponsor of H.R. 3361, The USA FREEDOM Act, which is legislation
designed to rein in the dragnet collection of data by the National
Security Agency (NSA) and other government agencies, increase
transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC),
provide businesses the ability to release information regarding FISA
requests, and create an independent constitutional advocate to argue
cases before the FISC. Read more about this bill here
.
Cosponsor of the bipartisan bill, H.R. 2399, the Limiting Internet
and Blanket Electronic Review of Telecommunications and Email Act
(LIBERT-E Act) that restricts the federal government's ability under
the Patriot Act to collect information on Americans who are not
connected to an ongoing investigation. The bill also requires that
secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court opinions be
made available to Congress and summaries of the opinions be made
available to the public. Read more about this legislation here
.
Rep. Matt Salmon (AZ-05) serves on the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs as Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. He
is also a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

Avoid

Salmon&#8217;s
Statement
on
President&#8217;s
Changes
to
Signal
Intelligence
Activities
Washington &#8212;Today,
Rep.
Matt
Salmon
(AZ-05)
released
the
following
statement
regarding
the
President&#8217;s
announced
changes
to
the
National
Security
Agency&#8217;s
(NSA)
phone-data
collection
program:
&#8220;While
I
appreciate
these
steps,
I
remain
concerned
about
the
privacy
rights
of
American
citizens.
&#8220;I
believe
we
must
err
on
the
side
of
freedom.
The
NSA&#8217;s
collection
of
domestic
data
on
U.S.
citizens
must
be
limited
in
scope
and
related
to
a
duly
authorized
investigation.
This
would
allow
our
national
security
community
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
the
ever-changing
battle
against
terrorism,
while
preserving
our
constitutional
rights.
&#8220;I
agree
with
the
President
that
Congress
does
have
a
role.
That
is
why
I
am
a
cosponsor
of
H.R.
3361,
USA
FREEDOM
Act,
that
would
reform
and
rewrite
the
Patriot
Act.
Protecting
U.S.
civil
liberties
and
our
constitutional
right
to
due
process
is
not
up
for
debate.
It
is
important
to
clarify
our
laws
and
ensure
these
protections
for
U.S.
citizens
are
never
infringed
upon,
while
still
meeting
our
national
security
needs.
&#8220;As
we&#8217;ve
seen
this
past
year
from
multiple
NSA
leaks,
the
federal
government
collects
phone
records
and
intercepts
electronic
communications
on
a
scale
previously
unknown
to
most
Americans.
The
lesson
is
clear:
we
must
remain
vigilant
to
ensure
that
law
abiding
Americans&#8217;
information
isn&#8217;t
needlessly
swept
up
into
a
government
database
and
that
Congress
can
fulfil
its
duty
of
oversight,
enacting
enact
sound
laws
and
fixing
broken
ones.&#8221;
Privacy
for
American
citizens
remains
a
top
priority
of
Rep.
Salmon.
He
is
a
sponsor/cosponsor
of
the
following
legislation:
&#8226;
Sponsor
of
H.R.
1847,
the
Electronic
Communications
Privacy
Act
Amendments
Act
of
2013 ,
a
bill
designed
to
increase
protections
for
electronic
communications,
including
personal
emails,
of
U.S.
citizens.
His
bill
addresses
the
privacy
concerns
raised
from
the
recent
position
by
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
that
the
Fourth
Amendment
does
not
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
emails
because
internet
users
do
not
&#8220;have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
such
communications.&#8221;
The
Senate
companion,
S.
607,
is
sponsored
by
Senator
Lee
(R-UT)
and
Chairman
Leahy
(D-VT).
