Congressman Cook Cosponsors Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act
Congressman Cook has signed on as a cosponsor to H.R. 3086, the
"Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act." This important legislation will
keep internet access affordable, drive innovation, and promote access
to the internet as a critical gateway to jobs, education, healthcare,
and entrepreneurial opportunities.
This bill will permanently prevent state and local governments from
imposing new taxes on internet access or imposing multiple or
discriminatory taxes on e-commerce. This would make permanent the
existing provisions of the Internet Tax Freedom Act enacted in 1998.
Said Cook, "Access to the internet is critical for working families.
Keeping the internet tax free ensures that this valuable tool remains
affordable for millions of Americans. The internet has been an engine
of economic growth, and as long as it remains free from the stifling
effects of over-taxation, it will continue to expand our economy."
Congressman Cook Meets with Constituents in Highland

on February 13. He appreciates everyone who came out and enjoyed the
thought-provoking questions and engaging conversation.
A Message from Congressman Cook
A 77-year-old Widow from Apple Valley was seeking assistance receiving
benefits and funeral costs from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The
woman originally filed in November 2011 and was initially denied. After
a few years into the appeal process, she sought assistance from my
office. My staff worked directly with the VA to request action. The
woman was approved for burial reimbursements and all survivor benefits
she was entitled to as a spouse.
My office and I are happy to assist constituents with help on similar
issues. Please contact my Apple Valley District Office with any
questions or concerns at (760) 247-1815.
