Enforcing
the rule of law and reuniting all unaccompanied alien children (UAC)
with their families in their home countries is the goal of legislation
I introduced in the House Thursday
morning.
The Protection of Children Act of 2014
amends
the 2008 anti-trafficking law that makes it difficult to deport children
not from Canada or Mexico and
will streamline the
removal process of the migrants. While my bill protects those who qualify
for asylum, it expedites the deportation of children who are not
legitimate victims of human trafficking or have credible fears of
returning to their country. We cannot allow individuals to continue to abuse
our laws and this bill ensures that they
cant.
President Obama created the crisis at our border in 2012 when he
announced to the entire world that the United States would no longer
deport children who come to our country illegally. The border emergency
affects all Texans and the legislation I have come up will help fix the
Obama Administrations self-inflicted crisis in our
backyard.
Right now, Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) holds these children for 72 hours before transferring them to
the care of Health and Human Services. Under my bill, ICE will be
required to hold these children for 30 days, while requiring minors to
appear before a judge with 14 days.
Please read
this Politico article
to learn more about my
legislation.
On Wednesday, the House of
Representatives passed the
FY15 Financial Services &amp;
General Government Appropriations Act
with a vote of 228-195 ( Roll Call 427 ). This bill reins in the Obama
Administration and protects Americans from the detrimental overreach of agencies,
such as the IRS, by reducing spending and requiring more
accountability. This legislation provides a total of $21.3 billion in discretionary
spending $566 million below FY14 and $3 billion below the Presidents
requests. In addition, it prohibits the IRS from targeting Americans
based on their political beliefs and prevents the agency from
implementing the ObamaCare individual mandate.
This
is the seventh appropriations bill House Republicans have passed.
The Senate has passed zero. I urge Senate Democrats to put Americans
first and follow the Houses lead by passing appropriations bills that
strengthen our economy and create a better life for all
Americans.
I am looking forward to getting back to Texas
for the weekend. I will be back in Washington on the 22nd for another
busy week.
