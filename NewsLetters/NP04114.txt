Happy Thanksgiving
Just a brief note to wish you, your family and your friends well this Thanksgiving. While we face many challenges nationally, we also have numerous blessings to be thankful for as Americans.
We can be especially thankful for those of our fellow citizens who work to provide us with the safety and security that is sometimes taken for granted. To all those who serve in the Armed Forces, public safety officers, and first responders, thank you for your commitment and service.
I hope everyone has a joyous and safe Thanksgiving tomorrow in the company of family and friends.
With best wishes,
Sincerely,
Charlie
