Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
When veterans return home and reenter civilian life, we need to
encourage employers to hire them and put their skills to good use. It's
the least we can do after these men and women have put their lives on
the line for our country.
But an important tax credit for businesses who hire returning service
members and wounded warriors, including Iowa National Guard and Reserve
members, will expire at the end of this year.
That's why I've introduced the Hire a Hero Act, common sense
legislation that would make these tax credits permanent. In fact, both
Governor Terry Branstad and Lt. Governor Kim Reynolds have added their
support.
Just yesterday, I traveled to Hy-Vee stores in Cedar Falls,
Marshalltown and West Des Moines to push for this important, bipartisan
legislation.
Watch this short news clip from KWWL and learn how this legislation
helps local businesses (it's only a minute long):
Watch the video!
The possible expiration of these veterans hiring tax credits comes as
unemployment among post-9/11 veterans is rising. In June 2013, the
national unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans was at 7.2 percent,
but as of October 2013, this rate had increased to 10 percent.
Making these tax credits permanent is common sense. To learn more and

All the best,
Bruce
