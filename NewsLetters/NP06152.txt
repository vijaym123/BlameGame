Friends,
This week was a busy one as we voted to keep the government
running, spur American job creation and take action against
ISIS.
Regarding ISIS, I want you to know that I do not support boots
on the ground. The authorization passed by the House allows the U.S. to
strengthen local partners who are already fighting Islamic State
forces. It also provides rigorous oversight of these actions. With ISIS
posing a clear, growing threat, I made the difficult choice to vote for
taking these steps to protect our nation.
Now I am back
in Northeast Ohio and so glad to be here. Over the next few weeks, I'll
be meeting with constiutents and attending events all around the 14th
District. I hope to see you!
Here's a rundown of the
past few days:
Thanking our
veterans
It was an honor to welcome the Cleveland
Honor Flight to the World War II Memorial in DC on Wednesday morning. As
the son of a WWII veteran, it is always thrilling for me to spend
time with these heroes and have the opportunity to thank them for their
service to our nation.

Upcoming
Event:
Military Academy Information
Day
On Saturday, September 27, my office will host a Military Academy
Information Day for OH-14 students of all ages and their families. The
event will begin at 9:30 a.m. at the Auburn Career Center's Technology
Learning Center Building located at 8221 Auburn Road in Concord
Township.
Representatives from the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S.
Military Academy (West Point), U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Naval
Academy and U.S. Coast Guard Academy have been invited to attend,
make presentations and take questions. Anyone who has an interest in
learning more about the service academies and the nomination process is
welcome to attend. For additional information, please contact Maureen
Jeffery at 440-637-8021 or
440-352-3939.
Voting for Ohio jobs
Encouraging job growth in
Northeast Ohio remains my top priority, so I was pleased to vote for two
legislative packages that prioritize job creation and American energy
independence. H.R. 4, the
Jobs for America Act , is packed full
of common sense solutions for helping Americans get back to work, such
as restoring the 40-hour work week, encouraging employers to hire
veterans, simplifying the tax code for small businesses and cutting red
tape that hurts our job creators.
H.R. 2, the
American
Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act ,
calls for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, puts sensible limits
on the EPAs mounting list of regulations and improves access to
renewables such as natural gas. Our nation has already made great strides
to increase domestic energy production, but we must utilize all
available energy sources to lower prices for Ohio families and restore
opportunity here at home.
Standing up for small
business
Thank you to the National Federation of
Independent Business (NFIB) for naming me a 'Guardian of Small Business'
based on my work in Congress. With small businesses generating two out of
every three new jobs, I will keep fighting against unnecessary
regulations that inhibit their growth.
Stay
Connected
While I'm traveling around the district over the
next few weeks, I'll be sharing photos and updates from the road. Be
sure to follow me on social media -- who knows, you may wind up in one
of the photos!
