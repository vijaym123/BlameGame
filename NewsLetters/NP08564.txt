This has been another busy week in Washington. Something
that is foremost in my mind is
whats going on
right now in the Rio Grande Valley . We have an invasion of
undocumented immigrants, including unprecedented numbers of what we call UAC,
Unaccompanied Alien Children at our
border.
These children are coming across the border in record numbers. The number
of undocumented children apprehended by the United States Customs and
Border Protection in May 2014 increased by 267 percent over the number
apprehended in May 2013.
During the same period, the number of
undocumented adults increased 72 percent.
At a rate of $5,000
per child, these criminal smuggling groups earned at least $53,230,000
in May alone. This is the direct result of the bad policies coming out
of the White House and the Presidents refusal to enforce the laws at
the border.
Today I sent
a letter
with Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY5) and several of my
House colleagues to the President demanding that he enforce the law.
Thousands of children and families are crossing our border every month
because the President has chosen not to enforce our border and
immigration laws. The chaos created by the Presidents lack of enforcement is
at a tipping point and this crisis has to be solved before our border
patrol is completely overwhelmed. The President has the resources and
the authority to enforce the law and I demand he do
so.
This week we also passed the
FY15 Defense
Appropriations Act
by a vote of 340-73 ( See Roll
Call #338 ). This legislation provides funding for critical
defense priorities and gives our service members a 1.8% pay
raise.
We also had leadership elections this week. The
Republican Conference elected Congressman
Kevin
McCarthy
as Majority Leader and Congressman
Steve
Scalise
as Whip.
I am
headed back to Texas for the weekend and will be back in Washington
on Monday, June 23.
