Saving Our
Coast
The Treasury Department
announced Friday
that Louisiana will begin to receive funds
for coastal restoration projects that have been allocated under the
RESTORE Act.
Fully implementing the RESTORE Act is critical to
Louisianas recovery from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
I have pressed the Obama Administration to implement this legislation
and I am glad to see it is finally
happening.
Protecting Private
Property
Also on Friday,
I joined Senator
Vitter
at a hearing in New Orleans to discuss the potential impact
of the EPAs proposed Waters of the United States Rule, and how it
could harm our families and businesses.
This rule could
hinder economic development and give government more control over private
property.
It is another example of the Obama Administration
bypassing Congress to implement their anti-energy
agenda.
Service Academy
Day
On Saturday, September 6, I will
host my annual Service Academy Day event with Senator David Vitter.
It will be from 8:30 AM to Noon at the Louisiana State Museum on
660 North Fourth Street
in Baton
Rouge.
This is an opportunity for students interested in the Service Academies
to learn more about what they have to offer.
I hope to see you
at the event!
