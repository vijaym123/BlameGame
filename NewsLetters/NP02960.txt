Dear Friend,
First of all,
I have to extend my congratulations to our New England Patriots on
winning their fourth Super Bowl and bringing the Lombardi trophy back to
Massachusetts! It was truly an extraordinary finish to an
extraordinary season.
Exciting things have been happening in
Washington, D.C. as well over the past few weeks. I was honored to be recently
named the highest ranking Democratic member
on the
House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands. The Subcommittee
on Federal Lands, (which was previously called Public Lands and
Environmental Regulation), is responsible for all matters related to the
National Park System, U.S. Forests, public lands and national monuments.
The Third District is home to several national historic and wildlife
areas, such as Minuteman National Historical Park and Lowell National
Historical Park. We have a long-standing practice in the Commonwealth
of preserving natural habitats and protecting open spaces for public
benefit, and I will draw from that tradition as I take on this
leadership role.
Last week, I introduced a bill that would award the
Congressional Gold Medal to the
U.S. Air Forces
Escape and Evasion Society . Formed in 1964, the U.S. Air Forces Escape
and Evasion Society (AFEES) is an organization created by aircrew
members who evaded capture by enemy forces during foreign wars with the
assistance of resistance organizations and patriotic nationals of
foreign countries. Read more about AFEES in this weeks
newsletter.
Also in this weeks newsletter, you can find my statement on the
Presidents recently released
FY2016 Budget plan ,
the confirmation hearing for the new Secretary of Defense, and some
quick facts about the
need to fund the Department of
Homeland Security . You can also watch video of my interview on
Broadside with Jim Braude .
As always, I
look forward to your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter . Thank you for staying
engaged and enjoy this edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
