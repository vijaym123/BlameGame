Dear Friend: As we give thanks this
holiday season for the tremendous blessings
we enjoy, we have a golden opportunity to
strengthen the ties that bind us as a
community. From the very beginning,
Thanksgiving has served as an opportunity to
cast differences aside and come together in
fellowship. Its also a time to lend a
helping hand to the vulnerable among us and
lift a prayer for the brave men and women in
uniform fighting to keep us safe. I hope you
enjoy a happy Thanksgiving tomorrow
surrounded by loving family and cherished
friends.
Thank you, and God bless. Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
