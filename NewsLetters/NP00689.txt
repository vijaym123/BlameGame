Honoring Our Heroes This Memorial Day
Freedom is not free
it comes at incredible cost. Since our founding, millions of brave Americans have gone into harms way so that we could enjoy the blessings of peace and prosperity. They left behind their families, their friends, and their hopes and dreamssome never to return home to them ever again.
American troops have died to liberate millions from the forces of tyranny. Theyve stared evil in the eyes and stood for all that is good in the world. Because of their heroism, their sacrifices have reverberated throughout the ages. It is their sacrifice that we honor this day, and every day.
We must also remember the families of the fallen who are left to carry on afteras President Lincoln saidhaving laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.
I have no words I can offer them to ease the pain of their loss; no words adequate to express my gratitude for the depth of their sacrifice. What I do knowwithout a doubtis that my 13 year-old daughter and 11 year-old son will sleep in a more safe and more free America tonight because of their bravery and sacrifice.
On this Memorial Day, my thoughts are on those heroes who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and my prayers of comfort are with their families. Our devotion to their memory must be as boundless and endless as their devotion was to us.
Yours respectfully,
