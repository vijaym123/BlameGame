Wait times at local VA better than average
Op-ed: Misplaced priorities at the VA
Prosecuting VA Officials Would Be 'Shot Heard Around the System'
Dear Friends,
We had quite the busy week in Washington, with the passing of my
Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act to working with my colleagues
to pass legislation that will reduce the tax burden on small
businesses.
Sincerely,
Dan Benishek M.D.
Member of Congress

PASSED: Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act (H.R. 2072)
This week, legislation I introduced in May 2013, the Demanding
Accountability for Veterans Act (H.R. 2072)
was passed in the
House with unanimous support. Having worked in a VA hospital for 20
years as a surgeon, I know what it's like to deal with the VA's huge
bureaucracy and lack of accountability.
From my first day on the
Veterans Committee, I have worked to investigate the problems at the VA
and find solutions.
This bill is a step in the right direction in
making sure the VA gives our veterans the care they need and deserve.
The time for excuses is over; the time for action is now.

PASSED: Veterans' Access to Care Act (H.R. 4810)
This week we also passed H.R. 4810, the Veterans' Access to Care Act,
which will meet the immediate need of veterans: access to
quality health care. It simply says to our veterans, you will receive
the care you earned in a timely manner, whether it's at a VA facility
or at their local hospital. It's time for the VA to take some
responsibility for the mess they've created and work to keep their
promises to our veterans.

Veterans' Oversight Hearing
On Monday, we held a veterans oversight hearing on data manipulation
and access to VA health care. It's time for change at the VA and we are
working hard in Congress to hold those at the VA accountable for their
inaction. We owe it to our veterans to ensure that they have timely
access to their benefits.

Empowering Small Businesses in Northern Michigan
As a former small business owner, I understand the burden that
employers are facing when it comes to the tax system. Since coming to
Congress, I've been working on supporting policies that will allow
small business owners to reinvest in their communities and businesses,
which will create more jobs right here in Northern Michigan. This week
we passed H.R. 4457, the "America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of
2014," which will reduce the tax burden on businesses by permanently
extending Section 179 expensing, which will help a farmer buy a new
tractor, or a restaurant get new kitchen equipment.

As your representative, I want to hear your thoughts on issues
important to you and Northern Michigan, so please call me at
202-225-4735 or send me an email through my website at
