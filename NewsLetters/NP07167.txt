August 10, 2014
Friends,
It is great to be home in South
Carolina for the district work month.
The House of
Representatives covered a lot of ground in July and voted on important
legislation.
During my first week home, I had the pleasure of traveling
around the district to explain the bills we passed, get input on upcoming
legislation, and listen to concerns about federal issues.
This week I visited Hartsville, Cheraw, Pageland, Florence, Dillon,
Surfside Beach, Pawleys Island, Georgetown, Conway, Aynor, and North
Myrtle Beach.
Here are some pictures from these
events:
(Clockwise from top right: Coffee Meeting at Trestle in Conway, Touring
CM Tucker Lumber in Pageland, North Myrtle Beach Town Hall Meeting,
Breakfast Coffee Meeting at Plantation Pancake House, Roundtable Meeting
at the Georgetown Library.)
At each meeting, we discussed the veterans
affairs health care bill, the crisis at our border, and the polarizing
political climate in Washington.
Since I was not able
to meet with everyone during this week, I would like to get your
feedback and hear what you think is the most pressing issue facing our
country.
Please take a moment to answer the following
poll:
