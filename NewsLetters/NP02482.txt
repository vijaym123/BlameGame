Reaction to Prime Minister
Netanyahu's Address to
Congress
3/3/15
"By
attending Prime Minister Netanyahu's address, the majority of my
colleagues in Congress demonstrated the true and unshakable bond between the
U.S. and Israel. President Obama prefers to keep Congress and the
American people in the dark about the details of the emerging nuclear
deal with Iran. However, Prime Minister Netanyahu made clear how
dangerous the direction of these negotiations really is. With two deadline
extensions behind us, with the Administration's acquiescence to
enrichment, and with a potential sunset clause of no more than 10-15 years in
the agreement, we now know once and for all, this is a bad deal.
Congress must assert its role and responsibility as a co-equal branch in the
safety of America and Israel. The deal to strive for is the one that
is best for the safety and security of America and our allies, not the
one that is best for
Iran."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
