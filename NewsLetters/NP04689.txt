Wicker Celebrates
America's Legacy of
Military Service on Veterans
Day
Congress Should Continue to Reform
VA System, Keep
Troops
Prepared
Americans celebrate Veterans Day in many ways
from participating in
community parades and patriotic tributes to saying a simple word of thanks to
a service member.
The right to cast a ballot on Election Day
this month was just one reminder of how precious our freedom is and the
importance of preserving it.
On Veterans Day, we honor those who
have risen to the challenge by serving in our armed
services.
Restoring
Accountability
Congress plays an important role in ensuring that America's
veterans receive the care and respect they deserve.
A number of
needed reforms were enacted this year to improve the quality of care
in VA hospitals and restore accountability after widespread reports of
patient backlogs and unofficial waiting lists.
The need for
reform was addressed during the Senate's confirmation of Robert McDonald
as the new Secretary of Veterans' Affairs and through the enactment of
bipartisan legislation that prioritizes efficient, high-quality health
care for veterans.
Under
the new law, veterans have more choices and flexibility when it comes
to their health services and providers.
They can visit non-VA
facilities if they are unable to get an appointment within 30 days or if
they live more than 40 miles away from a VA facility.
The
legislation also authorizes the establishment of 27 new VA medical
facilities, and it gives the VA Secretary new authority to demote or fire VA
employees for misconduct or poor performance.
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and
those Americans who served the cause, often in dangerous and far-flung
corners of the world, should have the best care available to them when
they return home.
Keeping
Promises
Congress also has a responsibility to
ensure that the federal government keeps its promises to veterans.
I was an early, outspoken critic of the misguided military pension
cuts in last year's budget deal, which would have affected at least
27,000 military retirees in Mississippi.
Congress reversed the
cuts earlier this year, reaffirming that the government will uphold its
end of the bargain and not put additional burdens on those who have
already shouldered sacrifice.
Staying
Vigilant
Recent wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan have produced a new generation of heroes, who join the ranks
of veterans from World War II, Vietnam, Korea, and the Persian Gulf,
among other conflicts.
The drawdown of forces from Afghanistan at
the end of the year closes a major chapter in U.S. military
involvement.
However, as we have seen with the current unrest in Iraq, it
is critical for the hard-fought gains in Afghanistan to be
maintained.
Persistent security challenges, including the threat posed by
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have demonstrated the need to
remain alert to new dangers
a priority that the new Congress should
confront without delay.
The history
of Veterans Day can be traced to the end of World War I, when the
fighting stopped between the Allied nations and Germany on the eleventh
hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.
First
known as Armistice Day, the commemoration was expanded to include all
military veterans in 1954.
Today, it remains a solemn day of
gratitude, pride, and patriotism, when Americans can come together to honor
those whose service and sacrifice have kept our country safe and free.
