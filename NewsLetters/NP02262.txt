CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER . . . LIVE ON
"YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO"
This
afternoon,
I joined Neil Cavuto for a live interview on Fox News
Channel
to discuss
PrepareNow.com , the
potential for terrorist activity in the United States, and prudent
steps ordinary Americans should take to be prepared.
My
objective is for Americans to be prepared, but not scared,
as we face real threats of attacks against our
homeland.
Americans and Europeans have traveled to Syria to fight with
ISIS, where they have been trained, incited, and mobilized.
Those
with valid European and American passports have easy entry back into
the United States.
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh
Johnson warns of terror cells operating in the United
States.
ISIS has pledged to plant their flag at the White
House.
Preparing for a potential terrorist attack is just a
thoughtful, prudent thing to do.
Growing up, I was a Boy
Scout, and our motto was "be prepared."
Every family should go
to
PrepareNow.com
to learn simple, common sense
steps for preparing your family, home, and business to mitigate the
impact of a potential terrorist attack.

Warfare, I have developed

resource offering common sense suggestions on preparing your home,
family, and business for a potential terrorist attack.
