Dear Friend:
When I was honored with the privilege of representing Florida's Second
Congressional District in Congress, I promised to engage in a
continuing conversation about the issues that matter most to North and
Northwest Florida. That's why I am pleased we had such great
participation - 2,856 responses in all - in our survey
last week. The feedback I
received will allow me to be more responsive to the needs of the people
I represent. In this week's newsletter you will find the results from
the survey - as well as the latest news and developments coming out of
Florida's Second Congressional District.
Survey Results
Our constituent survey last week asked four questions, two about how
best to communicate with you and two about important issues. Responding
to how often our e-newsletter should be distributed, the top selection
was "once every two weeks" - earning 42% of the votes. In response to
what information you most want included, participants overwhelming
selected "legislative updates" with 79% of the vote.
Regarding how we
should address Obamacare, the clear choice was "repeal Obamacare and
replace with patient-centered reforms" with 66% of the votes, followed
by "work to fix Obamacare's troubles with target reforms" at 22% of the
vote.
The last question focused on the economy and what should be the
top priority for Congress this year. The top selection went to "reducing
federal spending and cutting the debt" with 48% of the vote. In second
was "reforming the tax code" with 18% and in third was "Increasing the
minimum wage" with 13%.
Fighting for Apalachicola Bay
As we continue our fight for the future of Apalachicola Bay, I am
pleased NOAA announced $6.3 million in disaster assistance will be
directed to Northwest Florida's oyster fishery. With the future of
Apalachicola Bay and Northwest Florida's economy hanging in the
balance, I am glad these hardworking North Florida families will
finally get the relief they so desperately need. While this disaster
assistance is a critical step forward, the fight for our oyster fishery
is far from over. I remain committed to doing all I can to help
Apalachicola Bay's oyster fishery not just survive, but thrive for
generations to come.
Relief for Coastal Homeowners
Homeowners living along the Gulf of Mexico have seen their flood
insurance rates skyrocket as a result of FEMA's mismanagement and new
flood risk calculations under the latest reauthorization of the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
For this reason, I am pleased
that a bipartisan majority of the House joined me this week in passing
H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act.
This
fiscally responsible, cost-neutral legislation will ensure the NFIP
continues on a sustainable path while providing thousands of North and
Northwest Florida homeowners with relief from crippling flood insurance
rate increases.
Talking with North Florida Students
Over the past several weeks I have had the opportunity to speak with
students at Chipley High School and Marianna High School. After
visiting with these young men and women, I know that our country's
future is in good hands.
As the father of four daughters and former
chairman of the Early Learning Coalition of Northwest Florida, I am
passionate about providing our young people with the skills to succeed.
That's why I am fighting to empower parents, teachers, and school
administrators - not D.C. bureaucrats - to make education decisions on
the local level.
I've also voted to keep student loans affordable for
these students should they head off to college.
Putting Partisanship Aside to Address Poverty Challenges
When President Johnson launched America's War on Poverty in 1964, he
did so with an expectation that all Americans could one day fulfill
their "hopes for a fair chance to make good." Fifty years later, that
chance remains out of reach for far too many vulnerable families here
in North Florida and across America.

new solutions to America's poverty crisis, please click here

Dear
Friend:
When
I
was
honored
with
the
privilege
of
representing
Florida&#8217;s
Second
Congressional
District
in
Congress,
I
promised
to
engage
in
a
continuing
conversation
about
the
issues
that
matter
most
to
North
and
Northwest
Florida. That&#8217;s
why
I
am
pleased
we
had
such
great
participation
&#8211;
2,856
responses
in
all
&#8211;
in
our
survey
last
week. The
feedback
I
received
will
allow
me
to
be
more
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
people
I
represent.
In
this
week&#8217;s
newsletter
you
will
find
the
results
from
the
survey
&#8211;
as
well
as
the
latest
news
and
developments
coming
out
of
Florida's
Second
Congressional
District.
Survey
Results
Our
constituent
survey
last
week
asked
four
questions,
two
about
how
best
to
communicate
with
you
and
two
about
important
issues.
Responding
to
how
often
our
e-newsletter
should
be
distributed,
the
top
selection
was
&#8220; once
every
two
weeks &#8221;
&#8211;
earning
42%
of
the
votes.
In
response
to
what
information
you
most
want
included,
participants
overwhelming
selected
&#8220; legislative
updates &#8221;
with
79%
of
the
vote.
Regarding
how
we
should
address
Obamacare,
the
clear
choice
was
&#8220; repeal
Obamacare
and
replace
with
patient-centered
reforms &#8221;
with
66%
of
the
votes,
followed
by
&#8220;work
to
fix
Obamacare&#8217;s
troubles
with
target
reforms&#8221;
at
22%
of
the
vote.
The
last
question
focused
on
the
economy
and
what
should
be
the
top
priority
for
Congress
this
year.
The
top
selection
went
to
&#8220; reducing
federal
spending
and
cutting
the
debt &#8221;
with
48%
of
the
vote.
In
second
was
&#8220;reforming
the
tax
code&#8221;
with
18%
and
in
third
was
&#8220;Increasing
the
minimum
wage&#8221;
with
13%.
Fighting
for
Apalachicola
Bay
As
we
continue
our
fight
for
the
future
of
Apalachicola
Bay,
I
am
pleased
NOAA
announced
$6.3
million
in
disaster
assistance
will
be
directed
to
Northwest
Florida&#8217;s
oyster
fishery. With
the
future
of
Apalachicola
Bay
and
Northwest
Florida&#8217;s
economy
hanging
in
the
balance,
I
am
glad these
hardworking
North
Florida
families will
finally
get
the
relief
they
so
desperately
need.
While
this
disaster
assistance
is
a
critical
step
forward,
the
fight
for
our
oyster
fishery
is
far
from
over.
I
remain
committed
to
doing
all
I
can
to
help
Apalachicola
Bay&#8217;s
oyster
fishery
not
just
survive,
but
thrive
for
generations
to
come.
Relief

Coastal
Homeowners
Homeowners
living

have
seen
their

Talking
with
North
Florida
Students
Over
the
past
several
weeks
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
students
at
Chipley
High
School
and
Marianna
High
School. After
visiting
with
these
young
men
and
women,
I
know
that our
country's future
is
in
good
hands.
As
the
father
of
four
daughters
and
former
chairman
of
the
Early
Learning
Coalition
of
Northwest
Florida,
I
am
passionate
about
providing
our
young
people
with

to

That&#8217;s
why
I
am
fighting
to
empower
parents,

and
school
administrators
&#8211;
not
D.C.
bureaucrats
&#8211;
to
make
education
decisions
on
the
local
level.
I&#8217;ve
also
voted
to
keep
student
loans
affordable
for
these
students
should
they
head
off
to
college.
Putting
Partisanship
Aside
to
Address
Poverty
Challenges
When
President
Johnson
launched
America&#8217;s
War
on
Poverty
in
1964,
he
did
so
with
an
expectation
that
all
Americans
could
one
day
fulfill
their
&#8220;hopes
for
a
fair
chance
to
make
good.&#8221;
Fifty
years
later,
that
chance
remains
out
of
reach
for
far
too
many
vulnerable
families
here
in
North
Florida
and
across
America.

to
cut
through
the
partisan
bickering
and
find
new
solutions
to
America&#8217;s
poverty
crisis,
