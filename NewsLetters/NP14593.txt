Despite the expanding role of women in our economy, making up nearly half of all American workers, women and their families continue to face mounting economic pressures. Women, particularly unmarried women, are the most economically insecure in our nation.
That&rsquo;s why House Democrats, led by Congresswoman DeLauro, have put forth an Economic Agenda for Women and Families centered on Pay, Work and Family Balance and Child Care that recognizes the critical role women play in America&rsquo;s workforce.
