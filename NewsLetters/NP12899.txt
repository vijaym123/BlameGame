Propane Crisis Requires White House Action - NOW
Dear Friend,
With propane fuel getting scarcer by the day, and prices soaring beyond
$5.00 a gallon in some parts of our region, President Obama must act
immediately to knock down regulatory barriers, boost supplies, and
provide relief to families and agricultural producers.
That was the message I sent to the White House over the weekend,
joining Governor Dayton, Senators Klobuchar and Franken, and fellow
Minnesota delegation members Betty McCollum, Collin Peterson, and Tim
Walz in asking the President to do four things:
1.
Direct the U.S. Departments of Energy and Transportation to
work with pipeline and rail operators to drive more propane into the
Minnesota pipeline by easing regulatory barriers currently delaying
shipments from areas like Texas and Kansas with greater supplies.
2. Use Presidential authority to restrict propane shipments to
foreign nations for the duration of the shortage.
3.
Assure adequate funding for emergency deliveries to
communities that run out of propane entirely, should that become
necessary.
4.
Make emergency funding available to the hardest-hit
Minnesotans through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP) and the Rural Energy for America (REAP) program.
I hope to discus this matter personally - albeit briefly - with the
President himself after tomorrow evening's State of the Union Address.
And I promise to keep you posted as we work to get some much-needed
relief for hard-hit Minnesotans trying to stay warm. You can read our
letter to the President here

Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of
our offices listed below, or visit my website, www.nolan.house.gov

Talking Jobs with the Duluth Chamber of Commerce
The Duluth Radisson Hotel was packed with business people on Tuesday as
Mayor Don Ness hosted a luncheon discussion with Senator Al Franken and
me focusing on how we can all work together to create more good-paying
jobs throughout the region. We talked about my amendments to the Water
Resources bill to add funds for Duluth Harbor maintenance and Great
Lakes dredging, so necessary for increased commerce and business
activity - as well as our Small Airplane Revitalization Act, now law,
streamlining regulations for Cirrus Aircraft in Duluth, encouraging new
jobs and expansion.
Everyone was also glad to hear that the new budget agreement contains
an additional $15 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Project,
essential to expanding both commerce and tourism. Thanks in great
measure to the Duluth Chamber and Duluth's hardworking public
officials, the Port City is on the rise - a national example of
progress and cooperation.

EPA Watches Over Great Lakes From Its Duluth Ecology Division
Reviewing Great Lakes water quality data with UMD grad student Sarah
Hoheisel.
Sitting at the convergence of three great watersheds, at the tip of
Lake Superior - the largest body of freshwater in America - the
Environmental Protection Agency's Mid-Continent Ecology Division in
Duluth could hardly be more important. So I was excited to tour this
state-of-the-art facility, where scientists and other experts focus on
the Great Lakes, analyzing the ecological effects of toxic chemicals,
monitoring water quality and the results of global climate change, and
keeping watch for invasive species. The people and the technology they
employ are beyond impressive. Here I am with UMD grad student Sarah
Hoheisel reviewing computer images and data measuring Great Lakes water
quality.

Working Locally to Bring Federal Tax Money Home
Meeting with Duluth City Councilors and planners last week.
With Cloquet Mayor Bruce Ahlgren, Scanlon Mayor Annette Bryant, Carlton
Mayor Lawrence St. Germain and other county and school officials last
week in Cloquet.
Did you know that while many states get back $4 to $5 dollars for every
federal tax dollar they send to Washington, Minnesota gets back only
about 65 cents of every dollar we pay? Clearly, Minnesota's getting
short-changed when it comes to federal funds Congress has ok'd for
spending on roads, bridges, airports, harbors, education, parks, public
buildings, housing, and other important community projects throughout
our nation.
Amidst 435 Congressional Districts, there are always more proposed
projects than money to pay for them. So my staff and I meet regularly
with local officials here in the Eighth - to learn what we can do to
help aggressively procure federal money for all kinds of worthy
undertakings by our towns, townships, cities, and counties. Last year,
working in partnership with them, I was able to return more than $60
million to the 8th District - including $3 million to help clean up the
St. Louis River, $10 million for Duluth Harbor maintenance, another $10
million for community colleges, and several million dollars more for
Range Regional and other small airports throughout the 8th District.

Make It In America Tour Heads North
After visiting some 35 Eighth District small businesses and
manufacturers last year, the 2014 leg of our Make It In America tour
got underway last week, with visits to Scamp Trailers in Backus, Remer
Cut-Stock Lumber in Remer, Duluth Pack in Duluth and Sappi Fine Paper
in Cloquet. Each one is a local success story - creating good jobs,
building their communities, and proving once again that given a fair
chance, American businesses and manufacturers can compete and win in
the global marketplace every time. Here are some pictures and brief
stories from our busy week.
Rebuilding Cut-Stock Lumber in Remer
Visiting the reconstruction site of Remer Cut-Stock Lumber last week.
Last July 24th, Remer Cut-Stock Lumber burned to the ground - a tough
blow to that small community. Even during these cold days, the
rebuilding is continuing, as the company plans to reopen better than
ever later this year. Here I am getting a report from the guys on site
last week.
Scamp Trailers in Backus - Supporting Tourism,
Lowering Our Carbon Footprint
Scamp Trailers in Backus is generating good jobs helping supply our
multi-billion dollar northern Minnesota tourism industry. And they are
helping to reduce America's carbon footprint. Both of these important
contributions come via the lightweight fiberglass trailers you see our
visitors pulling behind their cars, small trucks, SUVs and mini-vans.
On tour, I learned that easy maneuverability makes these remarkably
comfortable small trailers perfect for the back roads camping that
draws tourists by the thousands into our region to spend their money
and grow our economy.
Duluth Pack - American Made and Guaranteed for a Lifetime
With Deb Tesser of Duluth Pack and a new, hot off the production lines,
briefcase bag.
Longstanding, stable manufacturing companies like Duluth Pack help
anchor communities both economically and culturally, and this
130-year-old operation has been providing good jobs hand crafting
canvas and leather bags, packs and outdoor gear at the same Duluth
facility for more than 100 years. On tour, I met each and every one of
their skilled craftspeople, including Deb Tesser (shown here with me),
who oversaw construction of my new briefcase bag, and presented it to
the proud new owner (me). I'll use it to haul papers and reading
materials back and forth with me to Washington.
Sappi Fine Paper - $175 Million Transformation to Produce Pure Cellulose
Along with tourism, taconite and small manufacturing, timber anchors
our northern Minnesota economy. So the news this fall that Sappi Fine
Paper in Cloquet had completed its $170 million transformation project
from a producer of pulp for paper into a maker of a timber-based
product consisting of pure cellulose is really good news. On tour, I
learned that pure cellulose is used for textiles, as well as for
pharmaceuticals, beauty and home products. In addition to continuing to
make high quality paper, Sappi will now produce some 330,000 metric
tons of pure cellulose for shipment across America and all around the
globe. Here I am with some of the folks on Sappi's management and
government relations teams - Wayne Brandt, Archie Chelseth, Mike
Schultz, Gary Erickson, Kraig Melin, and Rob Schilling - during my
"Make it in America" visit last week.

Men Against Trafficking Steps Up in Duluth
Onstage with members and supporters of the Men Against Sex Trafficking
task force, a group dedicated to ending the sex trafficking industry in
Duluth.
While Texas Republican Congressman Ted Poe and I, and others, press for
consideration of our federal legislation to help prosecute the
perpetrators of sex trafficking and protect and aid the victims,
northern Minnesotans are stepping up to do their part as well.
There is no better example than the Duluth-based Men As Peacemakers
group, which, among other things, engages community members in violence
prevention strategies. Last week, I was honored to speak at their press
conference announcing Men Against Sex Trafficking, a new addition to
the Peacemakers group, dedicated to ending sex trafficking in the Twin
Ports area. Congratulations to Ed Heisler, Sarah Curtis, John Pegg and
all the fine people who are organizing and supporting this worthy and
courageous program.
And congratulations to the City of Duluth - a model for the nation in
this inspiring, ground-breaking effort to rid their great community of
what amounts to modern day slavery.

Coming Up in Washington
.
The President's 2014 State of the Union Address is tomorrow
- Tuesday, January, 28th, and I'll have two honored guests with me.
Carri Jones, Tribal Chair of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and Melanie
Benjamin, Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, will be in
the House gallery, and I could not be prouder to have them. Watch next
week's Monday Report for pictures of that exciting night.
.
Also on Tuesday, I'll be speaking to 8th District Tribal
leaders at the National Indian Gaming Association during their Winter
Legislative Summit. I'll discuss my bill to enact the long-awaited land
exchange between the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and
Carlton County - currently held up in the Senate - as well as issues of
tribal sovereignty and tax reform.
.
We've had our expectations dashed before, I know, but it
does look as though the four ranking members and the conferees have
reached an agreement on a final Farm Bill. We expect to see a vote on
it in the next week or two. If so, be sure to follow my Facebook
and Twitter
accounts for up-to-the-minute information.

East Gull Lake, Askov, Pequot Lakes, Pine River, Backus, Isanti,
Motley, Pillager, and Milaca - check my website
for specific times and locations.
I hope you'll stop by with your thoughts or concerns, or with any issue
you may be having. We're here to help.
.
Later this week I'll be on the Range talking jobs,
broadband, and rural economic development with local elected officials
from Park Rapids and Itasca and St. Louis Counties - as well as
addressing the Hibbing Chamber of Commerce.

Finally...
Welcome to These Brand New Americans!
Speaking to a crowd of soon-to-be U.S. citizens, spectators, and Boy
Scouts last week in Duluth.
I was so honored last week to be among the first to officially welcome
13 new citizens of our great nation at a moving and inspiring
naturalization ceremony last week in Duluth. We recited the Pledge of
Allegiance and sang "The Star Spangled Banner" together, listened to
words from President Obama, and cheered each one as they accepted their
own personal American flag. Thanks to our local Boy Scouts and everyone
who helps make these events so special - reminding us all of the
privileges and obligations of citizenship here in America.

Propane
Crisis
Requires
White
House
Action
-
NOW
Dear
Friend,
With
propane
fuel
getting
scarcer
by
the
day,
and
prices
soaring
beyond
$5.00
a
gallon
in
some
parts
of
our
region,
President
Obama
must
act
immediately
to
knock
down
regulatory
barriers,
boost
supplies,
and
provide
relief
to
families
and
agricultural
producers.
That
was
the
message
I
sent
to
the
White

over
the
weekend,
joining
Governor
Dayton,
Senators
Klobuchar
and
Franken,
and
fellow
Minnesota
delegation
members
Betty
McCollum,

in
asking
the
President
to
do
four
things:
1.
Direct
the
U.S.
Departments
of
Energy
and
Transportation
to
work
with
pipeline
and
rail
operators
to
drive
more
propane
into
the
Minnesota
pipeline
by
easing
regulatory
barriers
currently
delaying
shipments
from
areas
like
Texas
and
Kansas
with
greater
supplies.
2.
Use
Presidential
authority
to
restrict
propane
shipments
to
foreign
nations
for
the
duration
of
the
shortage.
3.
Assure
adequate
funding
for
emergency
deliveries
to
communities
that
run
out
of
propane
entirely,
should
that
become
necessary.
4.
Make
emergency

Minnesotans
through
the
Low

Home
Energy
Assistance

(LIHEAP)
and
the

personally
-

Did
you
know
that
while
many
states
get
back
$4
to
$5
dollars
for
every
federal
tax
dollar
they
send
to
Washington,
Minnesota
gets
back
only
about
65
cents
of
every
dollar
we
pay ?
Clearly,
Minnesota's
getting
short-changed
when
it
comes

Congress
has
ok'd
for

on
roads,
bridges,
airports,

throughout
our
nation.
Amidst
435
Congressional
Districts,
there
are
always
more
proposed

than
money
to

for
them.
So
my
staff
and
I
meet
regularly

here
in
the
Eighth
-
to
learn
what
we
can
do
to

of
worthy
undertakings
by
our
towns,

Last
year,
working
in

with
them,
I
was
able
to

-
including
$3

the
2014
leg
of
our
Make

to
Scamp
Trailers
in
Backus,
Remer
Cut-Stock
Lumber
in
Remer,
Duluth

in
Duluth
and
Sappi

Each
one
is

that
given
a

site
of
Remer
Cut-Stock
Lumber
last
week.
Last
July
24th,
Remer
Cut-Stock

burned
to
the

-
a
tough
blow
to
that
small

Even
during
these
cold
days,
the
rebuilding
is
continuing ,
as
the
company
plans
to
reopen
better
than
ever
later
this

Here
I
am
getting
a
report
from
the
guys
on

-
Supporting
Tourism,
Lowering
Our
Carbon
Footprint
Scamp
Trailers
in
Backus
is
generating
good
jobs
helping
supply
our
multi-billion
dollar
northern
Minnesota
tourism
industry .
And
they
are
helping
to
reduce
America's
carbon
footprint.
Both
of
these
important
contributions
come
via
the
lightweight
fiberglass
trailers
you
see
our
visitors
pulling
behind
their
cars,
small
trucks,
SUVs
and
mini-vans.
On
tour,
I
learned
that
easy
maneuverability
makes
these
remarkably
comfortable
small
trailers
perfect
for
the
back
roads
camping
that
draws
tourists
by
the
thousands
into
our
region
to
spend
their
money
and
grow
our
economy.
Duluth
Pack

and
Guaranteed
for a
Lifetime
With
Deb
Tesser
of
Duluth
Pack
and
a
new,
hot
off
the
production
lines,
briefcase
bag.
Longstanding,
stable
manufacturing
companies
like
Duluth
Pack
help
anchor
communities
both
economically
and
culturally,
and
this
130-year-old
operation
has
been
providing
good
jobs
hand
crafting
canvas
and
leather
bags,
packs
and
outdoor
gear
at
the
same
Duluth
facility
for
more
than
100
years .
On
tour,
I
met
each
and
every
one
of
their
skilled
craftspeople,
including
Deb
Tesser
(shown
here
with
me),
who
oversaw
construction
of
my
new
briefcase bag,
and
presented
it
to
the
proud
new
owner
(me).
I'll
use
it
to
haul
papers
and
reading
materials
back
and
forth
with
me
to
Washington.
Sappi
Fine
Paper
- $175
Million
Transformation
to
Produce
Pure
Cellulose
Along
with
tourism,
taconite
and
small
manufacturing,
timber
anchors
our
northern
Minnesota
economy .
So
the
news
this
fall
that
Sappi
Fine
Paper
in
Cloquet
had
completed
its
$170
million
transformation
project
from
a
producer
of
pulp
for
paper
into
a
maker
of
a
timber-based
product
consisting
of
pure
cellulose
is
really
good
news.
On
tour,
I
learned
that
pure
cellulose
is
used
for
textiles,
as
well
as
for
pharmaceuticals,
beauty
and
home
products.
In
addition
to
continuing
to
make
high
quality
paper,
Sappi
will
now
produce
some
330,000
metric
tons
of
pure
cellulose
for
shipment
across
America
and
all
around
the
globe.
Here
I
am
with
some
of
the
folks

gallery,
and
I
could
not
be
prouder
to
have
them.
Watch
next
week's
Monday
Report
for
pictures
of
that
exciting
night.
&#8226;
Also
on
Tuesday,
I'll
be
speaking
to
8th
District
Tribal
leaders
at the
National
Indian
Gaming
Association
during
their
Winter
Legislative
Summit.
I'll
discuss
my
bill
to enact
the
long-awaited
land
exchange
between
the
Fond
du
Lac
Band
of
Lake
Superior
Chippewa
and
Carlton
County
-
currently
held
up
in
the
Senate
-
as
well
as issues
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
tax
reform.
&#8226;
We've
had
our
expectations
dashed
before,
I
know,
but
it
does
look
as
though
the
four
ranking
members
and
the
conferees
have
reached
an
agreement
on
a
final
Farm
Bill.
We
expect
to
see
a
vote
on
it
in
the
next
week
or
two.
If
so,
be
sure
to
follow
my
Facebook
and
Twitter
accounts
for
up-to-the-minute
information.
Coming
Up
in
Minnesota
&#8226;
Congress
Comes
to
You
is
back,
with
meetings
held
by
my
staff
almost
every
night
this
week.
My
district
team
will
be
in
Braham,
East
Gull
Lake,
Askov,
Pequot
Lakes,
Pine
River,
Backus,
Isanti,
Motley,
Pillager,
and
Milaca
-
check
my
website
for
specific
times
and
locations.
I
hope
you'll
stop
by
with
your
thoughts
or
concerns,
or
with
any
issue
you
may
be
having.
We're
here
to
help.
&#8226;
Later
this
week
I'll
be on
the
Range
talking
jobs, broadband, and rural
economic
development
with
local
elected
officials
from
Park
Rapids
and
Itasca
and
St.
Louis
Counties
-
as
well
as
addressing
the
Hibbing
Chamber
of
Commerce.
Finally...
Welcome
to
These
Brand
New
Americans!
Speaking
to
a
crowd
of
soon-to-be
U.S.
citizens,
spectators,
and
Boy Scouts last
week
in
Duluth.
I
was
so
honored
last
week
to
be
among
the
first
to
officially
welcome
13
new
citizens
of
our great
nation at
a
moving
and
inspiring
naturalization
ceremony
last
week
in
Duluth.
We
recited
the
Pledge
of
Allegiance
and
sang
"The
Star
Spangled
Banner"
together,
listened
to
words
from
President
Obama,
and
cheered
each
one
as
they
accepted
their
own
personal
American
flag.
Thanks
to
our
local
Boy
Scouts
and
everyone
who
helps
make
these
events
so
special
-
reminding
us
all
of
the
privileges
and
obligations
of
citizenship
here
in
America.
