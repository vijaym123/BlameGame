Rubio Delivers Address on 50
th
Anniversary of the
War on Poverty
To mark the 50
th
anniversary of President
Lyndon Johnsons declaration of the
War on Poverty, Marco
delivered a speech that laid out
conservative reforms to combatting poverty
and opportunity inequality in America.
Rubio: The only solution that
will achieve meaningful and lasting
results is to provide those who are stuck
in low paying jobs the real opportunity
to move up to better paying jobs. And to
do this we must focus on policies that
help our economy create those jobs and
that help people overcome the obstacles
between them and better paying work. The
War on Poverty accomplished neither of
these two things. And we can achieve
these two goals. We have the single
greatest engine of upward mobility in
human history at our disposal: the
American free enterprise
system.

Rubio: Clear Signs Emerge That An
ObamaCare Bailout Is Coming
Today, Marco commented on new evidence
of the increasing likelihood of a
taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurance
companies under ObamaCare. This week,
insurance companies began making material
filings to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) regarding projections for
their ObamaCare risk pools.
American taxpayers should not
be on the hook for bailing out health
insurers, especially because ObamaCare is
not working the way it was sold,
said Rubio . Congress should
take an ObamaCare bailout off the table
by passing legislation Ive
introduced to repeal the so-called risk
corridor provision under the law.
If ObamaCare can only survive
through a taxpayer bailout of insurers,
its yet another clear sign that it
cant survive and isnt worth
saving,
he added .
