Congressman Lamborn Takes Part in GOP
Weekly Address
5/12/14
This weekend, Congressman
Doug Lamborn joined thirteen of his House colleagues in taking part in
the GOP Weekly Address to the Nation. The Congressmen call on
Democrats in the Senate and President Obama to act on House-passed
legislation designed to help the economy. Congressman Lamborn highlighted his
energy bill H.R. 1965, a bill designed to make it easier to develop our
resources so we can lower energy costs and reduce our dependence on
foreign oil.
