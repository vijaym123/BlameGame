Honoring Vietnam War Era Veterans
This past Saturday I was honored to join in a special ceremony to honor
those men and women who served in our armed forces during the Vietnam
War era.
I was humbled by the crowd that came out to show them that
their service and sacrifice will truly never be forgotten.
With
approximately 2,500 people present, we shared a simple message-our men
and women in uniform are the true American heroes.
The keynote speaker, South Carolinian and Medal of Honor Recipient
General James Livingston summed up the event perfectly when he said, "To
those of you who served, you deserve praise, recognition, love, and
respect.
You have all of that here today."
Thank you very much to all of our veterans, those who came out to honor
them, and the many organizations and volunteers who came together to
make the day possible. We owe all of our brave servicemen and women an
enormous debt, and it was my honor to be able to convey our gratitude
to them in this very special ceremony.

An Inside Look
ABC came down to South Carolina with me last week to learn more about
my path from North Charleston to the U.S. Senate, our ability to reach
new audiences with a conservative message, and how we honor the
veterans living in our great state.
In case you missed it on "This
Week with George Stephanopoulos," this past Sunday, you can watch the

Honoring our Promises to our Veterans
We have an obligation to provide the best possible care for the men and
women who have put their lives on the line to keep us safe. I am very
happy to report that a proposal which I supported to help fix the
crisis at the VA was signed into law yesterday.
The compromise legislation gives the VA the power to fire or demote
senior officials accused of mismanagement, effective immediately.
It
creates a system where veterans can seek private healthcare if VA
doctors are unable to treat the patient within 14 days, and caps costs
for the private care. It helps to remove the bureaucratic red tape
which slowed hiring, and additional money has been allocated to hire
more VA doctors and nurses.
It is an honor to serve as your United Sates Senator, and as always, I
welcome your feedback.
Send me a message here, or free to call my
office at the numbers listed below.
Sincerely,
Tim
