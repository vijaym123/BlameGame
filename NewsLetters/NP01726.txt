No Red
Meat?
This Administrations desire to move forward with its
policies on the American people continues.
On February
19 th
a panel of so-called nutritional experts decided to issue new
nutritional food guidelines; the panel recommended that Americans not
eat red meat or at least reduce their consumption of red meat.
Many of us feel that the panel did not make this recommendation out of
nutritional concern, but rather, out of political concern.
It
claimed red meat is contributing to Global Warming or Climate Change or
whatever they are calling it this month.
Science through the
prism of politics is not true science.
As Chairman of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, please know that I will do
what I can to ensure that such expert panels stick to their designated
tasks to prevent even further government overreach into the lives of
Alabamians. I was able to speak about this issue during a recent
interview with Fox News.

Secure
Rural Schools
Not every effort in Washington
gathers headlines.
Yet some that dont get the headlines are just
as important back home.
Some efforts are part of the every
day mechanics of making sure things get done
-- and not left
undone. The Secure Rural Schools program is one of them.
Back when lands were taken by the federal government to create
national forests like Bankhead National Forest in Winston and Lawrence
counties, a promise was made to the local communities to replace the
canceled property taxes and other revenue which had previously paid for
community priorities.
This would be things like roads and
schools.
The Secure Rural Schools program is one of those programs
and is important to a number of counties in North Alabama as well as
many states in the western part of our
country.
Unfortunately the funding expired last year.
Teaming up with other Members
from Utah and other western states, we worked to restore the program. I
am proud to say that we have passed the measure in the House.
It is expected to pass to in the Senate and get the
Presidents signature.
I will certainly keep you updated on this
issue.
Issues Facing Our Country,
State and the 4 th
District
I recently
had the opportunity to visit the studios of WHNT-TV Channel 19 in
Huntsville for a sit-down interview with Steve Johnson.
My
interview was part of a series the station produces called Leadership
Perspectives.
This is a long-form segment that allows leaders to speak
to constituents without being confined by short sound bites.
Steve and I were able to talk on a variety of topics from the economy,
the fight against Obamacare in order to make a better American
healthcare system, the critical situation facing us with ISIS in the Middle
East, and several others.
I encourage you to watch the segment
here .
