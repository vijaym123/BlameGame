Congressman Lamborn supports the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs
by the IRS Act of 2014
2/26/14
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014. This important piece of legislation will
prevent changes being made to 501(c)(4) laws making things more
difficult for grassroots political groups and organizations. The bill passed
on a bipartisan vote of 243 to 176.
"President Obamas IRS has shown that it cannot be trusted
to equitably and fairly enforce tax law. Now they are trying to
blatantly silence political speech they disagree with by changing 501(c)(4)
laws that have existed, without major problems, since 1959. It is
important that proper Congressional oversight prevents these attempted
abuses of power from taking place.
