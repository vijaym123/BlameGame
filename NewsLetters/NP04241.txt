Dear Friends,
The
Thanksgiving season is my favorite time of the year.
It is the one holiday that Madison Avenue has not figured out how
to commercialize.
Thanksgiving
involves family, food, and football; three things that I love.
I look forward to sharing this cherished holiday with my family in Lee
and Pontotoc counties.
For
many years, I have used the days leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday
to reflect on the things in my life for which I am thankful.
I was reminded of the importance of the attitude of
thanksgiving this summer .
I am most thankful
for my family and friends who have been a source of encouragement
during my recovery.
I am thankful for having
the privilege of growing up in Mississippi.
I had teachers,
coaches, church leaders, and scout leaders who invested their lives in
mine; helping me become the man I am today.
For their positive and
encouraging influences, I am thankful.
I am thankful that I was able to raise my children in Mississippi
among friends and family who share my values.
I am thankful for the opportunity to represent our conservative
Mississippi values in Washington.
I hope you and your family have a safe and happy
Thanksgiving.
Stay in
touch and God bless,
Thanksgiving This Thanksgiving season, what are you most thankful
for? Family Friends All of the
