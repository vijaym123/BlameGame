Congratulates Military Academy Bound Educational Complex Students
On Tuesday, June 3rd, Congresswoman Christensen joined the family and friends of two Educational Complex seniors who have been accepted into West Point and the Air Force Academy for the next school year. She congratulated
Chasen Richards and Orchadia Sackey
for earning full appointments to the Class of 2018 at West Point and the Air Force Academy, respectively. Both students were nominated by Congresswoman Christensen. Earning a full appointment to a U.S. Service Academy is an outstanding accomplishment and a rare honor. Students first compete with each other for congressional nominations in their respective congressional districts and then compete with thousands of academy applicants across the country for limited openings at the academies. Congresswoman Christensen said her office has made it a priority over the years to increase awareness of the U.S. Service Academies among Virgin Islands students through outreach efforts, such as Academy Fairs, in which service academy recruiters were invited to the territory. I am pleased that our efforts have more than paid off and we actually are almost full or have filled all vacancies allotted to the Virgin Islands, she said.
