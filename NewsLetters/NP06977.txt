Dear Friend, The Washington Post
is reporting that Republicans have an 82% chance of taking over the Senate this November.
They only need to flip six seats from blue to red.
We cannot allow one of those six seats to come from Massachusetts. If we lose in November, the Republican takeover of Congress would be disastrous for the middle class. Hitting our $55,000 August goal will give us the resources we need to keep fighting -- can you chip in $5?

If Republicans take over the Senate, the Koch brothers&rsquo; big oil agenda will have more than 50 supporters in the upper house of Congress. We can say goodbye to any action on minimum wage or climate change.
Instead, we can expect -- at best -- two more years of gridlock. At worst, Republicans might try to impeach the President. I&rsquo;m not going to let Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat fall into Republican hands, and I&rsquo;m counting on you to help me. Can you give $5, $10, or more before the 31st, so we can reach our $55,000 goal?
If all this sounds alarmist, well, that&rsquo;s intentional. The prospect of a Republican-controlled Senate should be alarming to anyone who cares about the middle class.
The Washington Post
isn&rsquo;t making up these numbers -- we need a grassroots groundswell to win this November, and we need people like you to make it happen.
Thanks for standing with me.
