HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Senate adds immigration transition policies to House insular energy bill - In a flurry of last minute actions on Thursday night, the Senate added language extending three Northern Marianas immigration policies to H.R.83
, an insular areas energy bill, then passed the combined bill and sent it back to the House. The three policies - a bar on claims of asylum in the NMI, an exemption from the numerical cap on H visas for the Marianas, and the E-2CNMI investor visa - will all expire on December 31. The extension would keep the policies in place until the end of 2019. The House passed H.R.83
earlier this week. Introduced by Congresswoman Donna Christensen (D-Virgin Islands), the bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to put together energy teams that would work with American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Freely Associated States on lowering the cost of electricity. Currently, residential customers in the NMI pay 40 cents per kilowatt-hour - three times the U.S. average. Getting legislation enacted is not easy and can require pursuing many different paths at the same time. Both the immigration policies and the insular energy provisions of H.R.83
are also parts of my Omnibus Territories bill, H.R. 2200 , and its Senate companion, S.1237 , which passed the Senate on June 18. The immigration policies are also included in my bill H.R. 4296 , which was ordered reported by the House Natural Resources Committee on May 29.
House passes child care bill to support working families - Parents who need help with daycare so they can work or go to school, got a boost this week. The House passed a six-year reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act
. The Act provides the Northern Marianas over $2 million yearly to underwrite child care costs for low-income households. As a result, mothers and fathers in 200 of our local families can go to work or improve their jobs skills, knowing their children are safe and cared for. That help is especially important as we move to replace foreign workers with U.S. workers. The reauthorization also requires that a certain percentage of each year's grant goes to improve the quality of daycare, with a focus on infants and toddlers. And the bill accounts for sudden changes of income, so even when the minimum wage increases in the Marianas this month-as I am glad to say it will-families will keep getting child care and parents will still be able to work.

Director General, Ken C.P. Hu, of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Guam, along with his wife, Sandy Hu, and Consular Officer Sofia Chih-chien Huang stopped by the Saipan Congressional Office, while in the Northern Mariana Islands this week. Thank you for your visit!
Energy bill permits off-shore mineral revenues for the NMI - H.R.2 , passed by the House yesterday, would permit off-shore mineral and energy development in the exclusive economic zone around the Northern Marianas and revenue sharing for the Commonwealth government. Defining the NMI as a coastal state under the Outer Continental Shelf Act , H.R.2
is a next step in expanding our rights in the waters around our islands. The first step was gaining ownership of near-shore lands and waters with enactment of Public Law 113-34
exactly one year ago this week. But, currently, there is no legal means to lease areas beyond that and into the exclusive economic zone for mineral and energy exploration and development. H.R.2
gives authority to the Secretary of the Interior to enter into leases, subject to strict environmental requirements, and to share the revenues with any nearby insular area. This is a similar arrangement as for coastal states, such as California and Louisiana. H.R.2
now goes to the Senate.
Federal funding drops under short-term continuing resolution - Fiscal year 2015 begins on October 1 and federal funding for the Commonwealth will continue - at least until December 11 - under the continuing resolution approved this week. Over all, FY15 funds are being cut 0.0554 percent from the FY14 level. This sequestration was agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013
. But much of how that cut is distributed among programs will be up to the various federal agencies responsible for administering the money. Keeping the government funded into fiscal 2015 was a legislative priority this week, but leadership made the decision to put off passage of full-year spending bills until after the November elections.
Natural Resources Committee approves bill to curb illegal fishing - Protecting local fishermen from unfair competition by illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing around the Northern Marianas and in all U.S. waters is one of the goals of H.R.69 . We approved the bill in the House Natural Resources Committee on Thursday. Guam Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo (D) authored the measure; I am an original co-sponsor. Not only will this legislation protect domestic fishermen who follow the rules, but it will also protect the marine ecosystems so important to our island economy. H.R.69
will increase the inspection, identification, and monitoring of illegal foreign vessels. And it amends several international agreements to incorporate civil and criminal penalties and broaden data sharing authority with foreign governments. The goal is to identify and penalize nations that do not comply with fisheries management regulations.
