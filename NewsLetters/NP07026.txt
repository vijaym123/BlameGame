Dear Friend,
This past month, the Medicare and Social
Security Trustees released their annual
reports on the status of our nations
Social Security and Medicare programs.
According to the reports, Medicare will run
out of money to pay full benefits in 2030
and Social Security in 2033. Even more
concerning is that the Social Security
Disability Trust Fund is expected to be
depleted as soon as 2016. If left
unaddressed, benefits for 9 million
disabled people will be cut by 20 percent.
These reports send a clear message; it is
essential that these programs are reformed
to ensure they exist for future
generations. The longer Congress waits to
take action, the more difficult it will
become to minimize the adverse impact on
beneficiaries, providers, and
taxpayers.
Our government is dependent on
pay-as-you-go programs. This,
unfortunately, has significantly
contributed to the budgetary outlook of our
Social Security and Medicare programs.
Todays workers pay for todays
retirees and the cycle will continue until
the public demands government officials
preserve these programs. Over the next two
decades, nearly 80 million Americans are
expected to retire and become eligible for
Social Security and Medicare. The difficult
reality is that there simply are not enough
workers to support the projected growth in
retirees.
Shortly following the release of the
report, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on
Social Security, of which I am a member,
held a hearing to discuss how Americans are
saving for their retirement and the current
status of the Social Security Trust Fund.
At the hearing, we learned that $80 billion
was added to the federal deficit this year
due to Social Securitys shortfall.
Mandatory spending, such as Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, currently
takes up nearly two-thirds of the federal
budget. While spending on these programs
had little to do with the recent increase
in the deficit, it is the main reason why
the deficit is projected to rise under
existing policies. This is why changes to
these programs have become very popular
topics when discussing our growing $17
trillion national debt.
While I strongly believe in the need to
maintain a strong and viable safety net for
America's seniors, there is no question
that the federal government must implement
reforms to address the growing fiscal
crisis. Be assured, however, that I do not
support changes to these programs for
seniors who are at or near retirement age.
We made a promise to our seniors and they
deserve the peace of mind and certainty
that the programs they have been planning
their retirement around will be there when
they need them.
The Trustees reports are further
evidence that Congress cannot continue to
kick the can down the road. It is our
responsibility to ensure that these
programs are not only around for those at
or near retirement, but also those who have
paid into them throughout their
careers.
