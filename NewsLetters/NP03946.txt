Dear Friend:
I applaud Senator Feinstein for releasing the results of the Intelligence Committee's investigation so that the American people have a full accounting of the CIA's tactics during the Bush Administration.
The greatness of our country is that we are transparent and willing to admit our mistakes so we can avoid making them again in the future.
Some have suggested the release of this report could heighten the threats against us. Let's be clear: we have needed to be on alert 24/7 since 9/11. The truth is that the release of this report strengthens - not weakens - our nation.
Torture is wrong and violates our country's most fundamental values, and this report also makes clear it doesn't work.
