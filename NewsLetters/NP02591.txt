Dear
Friend,
With the 179th Texas
Independence Day just around the corner, I've been reflecting on why I
am so proud to be a Texan.
I'm working on a project to
commemorate the day and capture the spirit of Texas, and I need your
help.
Please send me photos of you and your family in your favorite
Texas spots.
You can email them to
texaspictureproject@gmail.com
by Sunday, March 1st, for a chance to see them
featured in an upcoming newsletter and on my social media
sites.
(To make sure you see them, subscribe to my
newsletter here , like me on
Facebook here , follow
me on
Instagram here , and follow me on
Flickr here .)
Looking forward to seeing your
photos and to celebrating Texas Independence Day!
-Senator John Cornyn
