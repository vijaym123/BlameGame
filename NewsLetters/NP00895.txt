Commemorating National Police Week
This week is National Police Week, which honors those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice. In Jackson, this hit far too close to home when Officer James Bonneau was killed in the line of duty in 2010. On Monday, we held a dedication ceremony to officially rename the Jackson Post Office in Officer Bonneau's memory. He gave his all for the Jackson community and his sacrifice will not be forgotten. And to all the police officers who daily risk their lives, thank you for your courage and dedication.
