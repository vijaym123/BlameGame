Passing Legislation
Getting the Job Done
Dear Friend,
It doesn't seem like a day goes by without turning on the news and
hearing about how dysfunctional Washington is.
All of a sudden,
everything you thought you believed in becomes blurred and all you hear
is static.
Whether it's political pundits recycling the same old
phrases like the "do-nothing Congress" or members of the opposing
parties trying to talk over one another, sometimes it just seems like
there is no one willing to get the job done.
But what you don't hear on MSNBC, CNN and FOX is that there are still a
few of us working across the aisle and passing legislation that will
grow the economy and help save more of your hard-earned money.
In a little over a year, I have helped author two bills from the
Financial Services Committee that have been passed out of the House of
Representatives in strong bipartisan fashion.
The Retail Investor Protection Act
passed the House last October and it
will help preserve and increase lower and middle income Americans'
access to affordable investments.
It will also ensure that retail
investors - families and individuals around the country - are not
harmed by misguided regulations coming out of Washington.
This week I took another big step in helping out hardworking families
all across this great nation.
On Wednesday, the House passed in strong bipartisan fashion H.R. 801, a
bill I helped author.
This bill would ensure that community-based
savings and loans institutions have the flexibility they need to raise
more capital so they can make more loans to hardworking families on
Main Street.
During a time when so many Americans are struggling to
get by in a tough economy, this bipartisan solution is a step in the
right direction to grow our economy, increase lending and create an
environment for good-paying jobs for all.
To watch my floor speech, please click on the image below:
I know it doesn't seem like you have a voice in Washington.
But I
spend every day reading your letters, combing through your emails and I
promise you that I hear your shouts!
Every meeting, every bill, and
every piece of legislation that I introduce is to make your lives just
a little bit easier.
As your Representative, I pledge to you that I will keep fighting to
improve the quality of your lives by creating an environment for
good-paying jobs, increasing the size of your paychecks, restoring your
individual liberties, and lowering costs on everyday items that you
depend on like groceries, gasoline and the cost of your health care.
If you ever have any ideas on legislation that would make your lives
just a little easier, please email me at Ann.WagnerMO02@mail.house.gov
to have your voices heard.
It is truly an honor to serve you and I look forward to talking with
you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Avoid
tables

more
than

Passing
Legislation Getting
the
Job
Done
Dear
Friend,
It
doesn&#8217;t
seem
like
a
day
goes
by
without
turning
on
the
news
and
hearing
about
how
dysfunctional
Washington
is.
All
of
a
sudden,
everything
you
thought
you
believed
in
becomes
blurred
and
all
you
hear
is
static.
Whether
it's
political
pundits
recycling
the
same
old
phrases
like
the
&#8220;do-nothing
Congress&#8221;
or
members
of
the
opposing
parties
trying
to
talk
over
one
another,
sometimes
it
just
seems
like
there
is
no
one
willing
to
get
the
job
done.
But
what
you
don&#8217;t
hear
on
MSNBC,
CNN
and
FOX
is
that
there
are
still
a
few
of
us
working
across
the
aisle
and
passing
legislation
that
will grow
the
economy
and
help
save
more
of
your
hard-earned
money.
In
a
little
over
a
year,
I
have
helped
author
two
bills
from
the
Financial
Services
Committee
that
have
been
passed
out
of
the
House
of
Representatives
in
strong
bipartisan
fashion.
The
Retail
Investor
Protection
Act
passed
the
House
last
October
and
it
will
help
preserve
and
increase
lower
and
middle
income
Americans'
access
to
affordable
investments.
It
will
also
ensure
that
retail
investors
&#8211;
families
and
individuals
around
the
country
&#8211;
are
not
harmed
by
misguided
regulations
coming
out
of
Washington.
This
week
I
took
another
big
step
in
helping
out
hardworking
families
all
across
this
great
nation.
On
Wednesday,
the
House
passed
in
strong
bipartisan

H.R.
801,
a
bill
I
helped
author.
This
bill
would
ensure
that
community-based
savings
and
loans
institutions
have
the
flexibility
they
need
to
raise
more
capital
so
they
can
make
more
loans
to
hardworking
families
on
Main
Street.
During
a
time
when
so
many
Americans
are
struggling
to
get
by
in
a
tough
economy,
this
bipartisan
solution
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
to
grow
our
economy,
increase
lending
and
create
an
environment
for
good-paying
jobs
for
all.
