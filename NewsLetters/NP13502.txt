The 6th District
Voting Against the Budget
Agreement
Dear
Friends:
I voted against the
budget deal when it came to the floor of the House of Representatives
last week.
I strongly believe that the deficit reduction targets
under the Budget Control Act of 2011, better known as the sequester,
were achievable so long as we could end the damaging across-the-board
manner in which the cuts had been administered.
The spending could
have been prioritized so that the essential services provided by the
federal government would have been maintained, while looking for new
ways to make the government operate more efficiently.
I recently
introduced H.R. 804, the Smarter Than Sequester Defense Spending
Reduction Act.
It would have nullified the across-the-board sequester
cuts and instead required the Department of Defense to formulate and
implement a specific and detailed plan to reduce spending by specified
minimum amounts over the life of the sequester,
Having served in both the U.S.
Army and the Marine Corps, Im well aware of the waste and
inefficiencies that plague the Department of Defense.
The Department of
Defense has still not been able to pass a financial audit, is so top heavy
that it now boasts more civilians (1.5 million) than active duty
military personnel (1.42 million), has more admirals than ships, a broken
acquisition system, and maintains overseas bases that are no longer
necessary.
Ive been fighting to reform how the Pentagon operates, since I
started on the House Armed Services Committee in 2009. My concern with the
passage of this agreement is that by relieving the financial pressure
on the Department of Defense, we will reduce the leverage to make the
necessary changes that will make defense spending both more efficient
and more effective.
However, I will continue to use my position
as a leader on the House Armed Services Committee to work hard to
reform the Pentagon, despite the fact that the budget agreement will make
that job a little harder.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S.
Representative

GAP Praises House Approval of
Military Whistleblower
Protection Act Makeover
By Dylan Blaylock
www.whistleblower.org
Published December 13, 2013
The Government Accountability Project (GAP) today
praised yesterday's House approval of section 1714 in the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (NDAA FY 2014), which overhauls
the discredited Military Whistleblower Protection Act (MWPA) of 1988.
The reform is a consensus between House and Senate negotiators, with
no Senate opposition expected when that chamber votes on the NDAA next
week.
GAP Legal
Director Tom Devine commented:
This is the first significant
advance in military whistleblower rights since they were enacted in 1988,
and it is long overdue. To date, the Military Whistleblower
Protection Act has created far more victims than it has helped. Our work is not
done, but this reform is a giant step toward parity with civilian
employees who challenge fraud, waste and
abuse.
Key House sponsors include
Representatives Jackie Speier (D-Ca) and
Mike Coffman
(R-Co). Key
Senate sponsors include Senators Mark Warner (D-Va), Timothy Kaine
(D-Va), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa).
The Need for Reform
The current laws track record is
indefensible, as seen by a summary of concerns below that have been verified by
the Government Accountability Office
(GAO).
Timely results : Under current
law, the Defense Department Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) IG
must complete investigations within 180 days. In reality, the mean time
is 451 days, and that figure understates average delays. Certain
cases have languished for five or six years.
Quality of investigations : The DoD OIG
only investigates 29% of complaints, and even in these full
investigations, GAO found there only is evidence sufficient to support
findings in 5% of complaints. Contrary to procedures requiring interviews of
all complainants in a full investigation, they occur in less than
half the cases. The lower, service-specific Inspectors General offices
(Army, Navy, etc.) that perform the work do not have standard processes
or procedures for their investigations, and the DOD OIG investigative
manual has not been updated since 1996 despite three recommendations
by internal and outside
reviews.
Prospects for Relief : The DOD OIG
process only has backed 6% of reprisal claims from Fiscal Year 2006 to
the middle of Fiscal Year 2011, and the record is getting worse. In
Fiscal Year 2006, 10.55% of complainants prevailed, compared to 4.9% in
Fiscal Year 2011
greater than a 50% decline. Worse, not all those
whom the OIG supports actually obtain relief
only 20 out of 2092 of
those who filed complaints received relief (less than
1%).
Due Process :
Currently, no due process exists. In theory, if the DoD OIG does not back a
military whistleblower, each service departments Board of Correction of
Military Records (BCMR) can hold a due process hearing. In fact, no
BCMR has granted a request for hearing in nearly 25 years since the
laws 1988 passage.
Legislative
Provisions
The following are a list
of updates included in NDAA FY 2014 which would strengthen the
MWPA:
Statute
of Limitations : This period would expand from 60 days to one year,
which is consistent with general best practice whistleblower
protections.
Protected
Audiences : Audiences for protected disclosures would expand to
include testimony to congressional and law enforcement staff, courts,
grand jury and court martial proceedings.
Closing Loopholes for Protected Speech :
The reform closes the same loopholes that Congress eliminated in the
civil service Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. Such loopholes
include: A whistleblower is not protected if someone previously
disclosed the same misconduct; oral disclosures not being covered;
whistleblower motives being challenged, and whether the disclosure was made
while on or off the duty.
Expansion of Protection against Forms of Harassment :
The reforms ban retaliatory removal of duties inconsistent with
rank.
Independent
Service OIG investigations : The reforms require service-specific OIG
investigations into reprisal to be handled by a higher organizational
department than the one where alleged harassment
occurred.
Administrative Due
Process Hearings : If not satisfied by OIG action, each member has the
right to a BCMR administrative due process
hearing.
The reform reflects
longstanding efforts by the Make It Safe Coalition. The whistleblower rights
coalition organized a
support letter
from
nearly 50 whistleblowers and organizations spanning the political
spectrum, and spotlighted
the nightmares of 10
whistleblowers
who were denied the right to serve their country for
defending it against fraud, waste and abuse by our own
government.
