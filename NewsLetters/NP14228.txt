Putting aside political posturing and partisan talking points, what is the healthcare law's real life impact on small businesses across America? A
survey of companies representing 42 million jobs , released this month by the International Franchise Association and Chamber of Commerce, reveals that the law is forcing our nations job creators to cut employee hours and halt job creation. Here are some highlights:
64% of franchise and 53% of non-franchise businesses believe the health care law will have a negative impact on their businesses.
29% of franchise and 41% of non-franchise businesses are already seeing health care costs increase due to the law.
Over 50% of franchise and non-franchise businesses are planning to make decisions, such as reducing employee hours, to comply with the laws employer mandate and definition of full-time employment as those working 30-hours a week, rather than the traditional 40 hours.
To place this burden on the backs of our nations number one job creators is both unacceptable and short sighted. That is why I championed solutions to:
Fully defund the law ( H.R. 2682 ).
Protect businesses from the penalties of the healthcare law ( H.R. 2667 ).
Relieve small businesses from burdensome tax reporting requirements ( H.R. 4 ).
Amend the definition of full-time employment to restore the traditional 40-hour week ( H.R.2575 ).
Yours in Service,
Randy
