I hate to bother you on a Sunday, I really do -- especially when you could be spending time with your family -- but this is important.
David -- I hate to bother you on a Sunday, I really do -- especially when you could be spending time with your family -- but this is important.
I know 2016 feels like it&rsquo;s a long way off, but I can tell you this:
races will be won or lost by the groundwork we set (or don&rsquo;t set) right now.
And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing you today. The DSCC has just four days left to reach their critical $300,000 end-of-month goal.
Can I count on you to stand with me and pitch in to lay the groundwork for a 2016 Democratic Senate takeover?
Launching a Senate race in the era of
Citizens United
is daunting and every candidate, every campaign manager knows they&rsquo;re going to need a solid plan to win.
And their key ally in launching a campaign that can win? The DSCC.
We are counting on them to help every candidate lay the groundwork they&rsquo;ll need to win in 2016. We are counting on the DSCC to help elect the type of partners we need in the U.S. Senate to fight for working families, make good on our promises to seniors, and get our economy back on track.
Let&rsquo;s get this done. Please pitch in now to help us meet this critical end-of-month goal. We&rsquo;re counting on the DSCC to take back the Senate -- and I&rsquo;m counting on you to help.

Thanks for taking some time out of your Sunday to help.

U.S. Senator
P.S. I can&rsquo;t tell you how frustrating it is to see legislation that would help working families languish in the Republican controlled Senate. If we work together with the DSCC, I know we can change this in 2016.
Pitch in now.
