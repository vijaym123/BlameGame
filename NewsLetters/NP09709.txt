Friends,
Sons, daughters, and
grandchildren across the country today are celebrating their mothers,
wives, and grandmothers.
Before I update you on what happened
last week in Washington, I would like to thank my mother, Katherine Rice
('Nana'), and wife, Wrenzie Rice, for their love and support.
Nana taught
me to work hard and love others, molding me into the person I am
today; and Wrenzie's dedication, love, and companionship have been the
constant in my life. I would not be in Congress without her hard work and
guidance.
Happy Mothers Day to Nana, Wrenzie, and all of
the amazing mothers in our district! I hope your day is full of love
and laughter.

Seniors Telephone Town Hall
Recap
Last Monday, my team and I held a telephone
town hall meeting for Seventh District seniors.
We were joined
by two special guests, South Carolina Health and Human Services
Director Tony Keck and Seventh District Director, Andrew Mims.
We
answered questions about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and
Veterans Benefits.
The most commonly asked question was,
If I have Medicare or Medicaid, do I need to enroll in the Affordable
Care Act (Obamacare)?
The answer is no, if you have
Medicaid or Medicare, you are not required to purchase additional health
insurance and will not be subject to Obamacares penalty fee.

SC Electric Cooperatives Visit
Washington
It is very likely that you
and your family are in contact with the SC Electric Cooperatives on a
regular basis;
these are the people that keep the lights
on in South Carolina.
Our states electric
cooperatives supply more than 1.5 million South Carolinians with electricity and
employ more than 2,000 people. Congressman Joe Wilson and I spoke to
the group last week about green energy and initiatives Congress can
take to make energy more affordable and sustainable in the Palmetto
State.
House Advances
Benghazi Investigation
My
colleagues and I voted last week to establish a Select Committee to
investigate the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three Americans were ruthlessly murdered on
September 11, 2012, the anniversary of September 11, 2001 terrorists
attacks.
This terrorist attack occured after weeks of violence
and requests for extra security personnel.
These requests and
warnings went ignored, and someone should be held accountable. Fellow
South Carolinian and friend, Congressman Trey Gowdy, has been selected to
lead this committee and I am confident he will spearhead a fair
investigation into the attack.
Two years is too long to wait
for answers, and I am glad the House of Representatives took a
responsible step toward finding the truth for the victims and their families,
and the American people.
