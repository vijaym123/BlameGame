Building Strong & Safe Communities
North Dakota has experienced unprecedented population and economic
growth in recent years, thanks in large part to the remarkable energy
development in the western part of the state. We have the lowest
unemployment rate in the country and nearly 27,000 open jobs, but that
growth has also brought new law enforcement, border security,
infrastructure, and safety challenges that can't be overlooked.
The derailment of a train carrying crude oil near Casselton last
December was a turning point. That incident shook all of us. We were
incredibly fortunate no one was hurt, but that incident reinforced that
we must do better to make safety our top priority. And we need to find
a balance because improved safety shouldn't come at the expense of
growth and development.
I've been tackling these issues head-on since my time as North Dakota's
Attorney General in the 1990s. To continue those efforts and bring
stronger attention to making communities safe, I recently announced my
new Strong & Safe Communities Initiative. It's an effort to help
address some of the emerging challenges facing the state by bringing a
greater focus to keeping North Dakota's communities strong and families
safe in their homes.
My initiative includes a new Strong & Safe Communities Task Force -
which I will lead - comprised of North Dakotans from across the state
who have strong, thorough understandings of many of the new safety
challenges the state faces, including:
*
Crime and drug crime
*
Human trafficking and domestic violence
*
Infrastructure stress on roads, bridges, highways, and waterways
*
Movement of crude by rail through North Dakota towns
*
New challenges in Indian Country
*
Border security
The group will work together to offer recommendations for a five-year
plan to help make sure North Dakota's communities remain strong and
safe for decades to come. Click here to learn more about my Strong &
Safe Communities Initiative and for details on some of the work I have
already done to make sure North Dakota's towns are protected.
North Dakotans are strong and resilient. Even in the face of tough
circumstances and disasters like the train derailment in Casselton, we
come together and don't shy away from the tough challenges we face. And
I'm confident this will continue and that's what I'm working to help
accomplish.
My top priority is to make sure North Dakota's families and communities
are safe and protected, and my Strong & Safe Communities Initiative
will play an important role.
With the critical input of community members, we have a tremendous
opportunity to come together, address the issues of today, and help
prepare North Dakota towns to handle and address these challenges well
into the future.

North

in

thanks
in
large

to
the

energy
development
in
the
western

of
the
state.
We
have
the

but
that
growth
has
also
brought

The

no
