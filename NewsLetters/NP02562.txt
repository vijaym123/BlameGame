Congressman Lamborn Denounces
FCC Net Neutrality Changes
2/26/15
After today's Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) decision to impose
new onerous rules and regulations on the Internet, Congressman Doug Lamborn
released the following statement:
The FCC, led by three Democrat bureaucrats hand-picked by President
Obama, approved a secret plan to fundamentally undermine a free and open
Internet. This decision ushers in a new era of government
micromanagement that will discourage private investment in new networks and
stifle the innovation that has allowed the Internet to flourish. With the
recent failures and mismanagement of Obamacare, it is astounding that
anyone would think that heavy handed regulation by government
bureaucrats can manage the Internet. This is a solution in search of a problem.
I look forward to serious Congressional pushback against this
secretive effort which threatens Americas continued leadership in the global
Internet economy."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
