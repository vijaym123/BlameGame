BREAKING NEWS
On January 28, the
President gave his fifth State of the Union address. Unfortunately, he spent
most of his speech avoiding the top two priorities of Americans across
the country
growing the economy and creating jobs.
Its little wonder he would chose to avoid the topic considering the
weak economy, lack of jobs, and the 6.7 million increase in those who
are suffering in poverty is largely due to the Administrations failed
big-government policies.
Just one week after the President
called for an increase in minimum wage as his solution to growing the
economy, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a
new report
finding ObamaCare would prompt nearly
2.5 million job losses over the next 10 years. The report also found
that due to ObamaCares definition of a full-time work week at 30
hours, lower-wage workers would experience the biggest reduction in work
hours
and ultimately, their paychecks. The American people are
already struggling under a stalled economy, and the loss of people
contributing to the workforce and jobs available is something we cant
afford.
The American people deserve to have their
priorities directly addressed, and they deserve real solutions to these
problems.
As we enter the second half of the 113th Congress, I
will continue to use my positions as Chairman Emeritus of the Science,
Space, and Technology Committee and the senior member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee to further your priorities - growing
the
economy and creating jobs
by pursuing conservative
principles.

ONGOING EFFORTS
Fighting
ObamaCare
Calling for Transparency with
Healthcare.gov
During the three months
since the disastrous launch of ObamaCares open exchanges, the
Administration has delayed and withheld status updates regarding enrollment
numbers. The American people
whose taxpayer dollars funded
Healthcare.gov, a $634 million website
deserve transparency from this
Administration. That is why, on January 16, I voted in support of the Energy and
Commerce Committees
The Exchange Information Disclosure Act
(H.R. 3362) .
This bill requires the Obama Administration to
provide the American people weekly assessments on the status of
Healthcare.govs enrollment numbers and technical issues.

Keeping
Users Identity and Privacy Secure
As Chairman Emeritus of the Science, Space, and Technology
Committee, on January 16 I questioned witnesses at a hearing to determine
identity security and privacy risks with Healthcare.gov. The panel of
witnesses testified that Healthcare.gov was at serious risk of being
hacked and that Americans personal and financial data entered into the
website was insecure.

My Pledge
to You
As Chairman Emeritus of the
Science, Space, and Technology Committee and a senior member of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, I will continue to hold this Administration
accountable and will work to pass legislation to defund the
Presidents bad health care law. I remain committed to fighting ObamaCare
until it is fully and permanently
repealed.
Fighting the
EPAs War on Coal
Americans across the
country and in the 4th District are concerned about their job and economic
security. One of the best and easiest solutions to encourage job
creation and economic growth is through domestic energy.
The way
we regulate our energy production is vital to our Nations future.
That is why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the
Electricity Security and Affordability Act , which I voted for and the
Energy and Power Subcommittee Republicans passed on January 14. The bill
offers a common sense solution to the EPAs proposed greenhouse gas
standards for new power plants and the agencys planned regulations for
existing power plants.

I stand with my constituents in
opposition to the Presidents War on Coal and his "cap-and-trade"
approach. Clean, affordable energy
and energy jobs
are what Americans need
and want. It is my hope the Administration will support this
legislation and true all-of-the-above energy solutions on behalf of all
Americans.
40th Annual March for Life
January 22 marked the 41st anniversary of the tragic
Roe
v. Wade
decision and the 40th annual March for Life. I am a
longtime pro-life advocate and have supported pro-life legislation
throughout my tenure in Congress and my prior work in the Texas Senate. I
believe everyone has the right to life and that we have a responsibility to
speak up for those who cannot defend themselves.
I am
always encouraged by those who sacrifice their time and money to travel to
our Nations Capital to march against abortion
it is a powerful
statement about the importance of protecting the right to life in the
Constitution. But regardless of where we are, we can all take a stand in
support of life.
On January 28, I voted and the House
passed H.R. 7,
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion .
4th
District constituents are strongly pro-life, and I will continue to
support efforts to protect the right to life of
all
Americans and
to prevent the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.

LOOKING
AHEAD
Conservative values are fundamental in keeping
America strong and competitive. I believe that by focusing on the top issues
of Americans
jobs and the economy
and by continually shedding
light on the failures of ObamaCare, Republicans will take back the
Senate this year. Once we have a Republican-led Congress, the House and
Senate can work together to repeal ObamaCare and pursue conservative
objectives to get America back on track.
Thank you for taking the time to read this
newsletter. I hope you found it helpful and informative as we kick off the
New Year.
Your views and concerns guide my efforts, and
I look forward to hearing from you
so that I may serve you to the best of my
ability as we work together to provide a better and brighter future for
ourselves, our children, and grandchildren.
Sincerely,
Ralph M. Hall
