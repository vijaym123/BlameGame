 to Congress outlining eight options to prevent the invasive species from entering the Great Lakes.
A recent study
conducted by the University of Notre Dame, the U.S. Forest Service and Resources for the Future identified the complete separation of the two watersheds as the most likely option to succeed.
According to the study, a complete physical separation would prevent 95-100 percent of Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan.
The Defending Against Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2014 (H.R. 4001) ,introduced by Representative Miller in February of 2014, authorizes the Secretary of the Army to completely separate the hydrologic connection between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan, preventing the invasive species from invading the Great Lakes. If enacted, the legislation would require the Secretary to start designing the project within 180 days in consultation with important stakeholders, including the governors of the surrounding states and the Great Lakes Commission. Once completed, the Secretary would have another 180 days to start construction.

Rep. Miller on Asian Carp eDNA in Kalamazoo River
H arrison Township, MI &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative
Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement
on today&#8217;s announcement by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) that Asian carp eDNA has
been discovered in the Kalamazoo River:
&#8220; Over the last number of years, this invasive species has been migrating up the Mississippi River, destroying ecosystems along the entire route and defying numerous actions taken to stop
their advance. Two years ago, the
Chicago Area Waterway System southeast of Lake Michigan tested positive for Asian carp eDNA.
Today, the Michigan DNR announced that the lower portion of the Kalamazoo River, which flows into Lake Michigan, tested positive for
Asian carp eDNA.
&#8220;This test only reconfirms that, unless drastic action is taken, Asian carp will invade the Great Lakes and wreak havoc on the economic and recreational resources they provide.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to have a cavalier approach to this imminent threat to our Lakes. We need a
permanent solution that prevents Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes, including complete hydrologic separation, which I have introduced legislation to accomplish.&#8221;
Background on
the Defending Against Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2014 (H.R. 4001):
Since the 1990s, Asian carp have been migrating up the Mississippi River watershed, invading and destroying ecosystems.
Earlier this year, the Army Corps released a
report
to
Congress outlining eight options to prevent the invasive species from entering the Great Lakes.
A recent
study
conducted
by the University of Notre Dame, the U.S. Forest Service and Resources for the Future identified the complete separation of the two watersheds as the most likely option to succeed.
According to the study, a complete physical separation would prevent 95-100
percent of Asian carp from entering Lake Michigan.
The Defending Against Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2014 (H.R. 4001) ,introduced by Representative Miller in February of 2014, authorizes the Secretary of the Army to completely separate the hydrologic connection between the Mississippi
River and Lake Michigan, preventing the invasive species from invading the Great Lakes. If enacted, the legislation would require the Secretary to start designing the project within 180 days in consultation with important stakeholders, including the governors
of the surrounding states and the Great Lakes Commission. Once completed, the Secretary would have another 180 days to start construction.
