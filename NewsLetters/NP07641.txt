Dear Friend, When the Tea Party took over the House, I knew things were going to get worse before they got better.
I have to tell you, it was immensely frustrating knowing that House Republicans would rather put partisan politics ahead of progress for middle and working-class families.
A lot of it was truly petty -- Republican committee chairmen would hold meetings and simply not tell Democratic members that those meetings were happening. But they were taking their lead from Mitch McConnell, whose stated goal was to make sure President Obama would be a one-term President.
Senator McConnell didn&rsquo;t achieve his goal, but along the way, he ground the business of American government to a screeching halt. His party&rsquo;s vote on the Senate&rsquo;s
Hobby Lobby
fix is merely the latest example of how this generation of Republicans puts partisan politics ahead of all else. I&rsquo;m fighting every day to move this country forward. But if the Tea Party completes its takeover of Congress this November, our work will get a lot harder. Contribute $5 or more to help me keep fighting.

The Tea Party&rsquo;s influence on the Senate is plain to see. They&rsquo;ve blocked action on the minimum wage, on gun control, and most recently on women&rsquo;s rights. I don&rsquo;t want to see the Senate turn into the Tea Party-controlled House -- and I need your help to stay strong. Make a $5 contribution so we can win in November and get Washington back to work for the American people.
Thank you for your continued support.
