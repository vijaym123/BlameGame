DISTRICT
Dear Friend,
I hope you and your family had an enjoyable
Thanksgiving and start to the holiday season. I was thankful for the
opportunity to spend time in and around the Third District over the past
week, visiting local organizations and talking to people who make our
region such a unique place.
On Friday, November 22 I was
able to spend time at three organizations that represent the Third
Districts commitment to service.
In the morning I spoke at
the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital 2013 Summit, held
at the Veterans Northeast Outreach Center in Haverhill. This years
event focused on ending veteran homelessness.
The Veterans
Northeast Outreach Center (VNOC) was recently awarded a federal grant
from the Department of Veterans Affairs for $22,750, which will allow
them to acquire a van for outreach and transportation to homeless
veterans. The grant was announced earlier this month as part of a $4.9
million program, reaching across 25 projects in 11 different states,
aimed at providing enhanced services for homeless veterans. As the only
Massachusetts member on the House Armed Services Committee, I have been
a staunch supporter of veterans and have written to federal agencies
in support of local outreach centers like the VNOC.
Later
that day, I had the opportunity to guest lecture Chancellor Marty
Meehans class on Congress at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. UML
is one of the states premier academic institutions and is growing by
leaps and bounds. During the class I discussed my experiences
representing the Third District in the House of Representatives and answered
questions from students about policy issues and politics. It was
encouraging to see a group of young people interested in public service and
engaged in their government.
Also that day, I visited an
organization in Westminster with my colleague Congressman Jim McGovern
(MA-2). We toured On-Site Academy, a non-profit, non-governmental
residential training and treatment center for critical incident stress
management. Founded more than 20 years ago, they provide mental health
resources to emergency service workers who have experienced trauma.
They serve all first responders: police, fire and EMS, as well as
veterans. On-Site assisted local emergency service workers who responded to
the Boston Marathon tragedy this past spring.
I am
thankful to represent a district with so many talented and dedicated people
working in service of others. Creative organizations like On-Site, UML
and VNOC are helping improve the quality of life for families,
veterans, students, first responders and so many more across the Third
District.
Please be sure to scroll down to read more
information on some of the other topics on which I have been
working.
As always, I hope that you continue to provide me with your
thoughts, feedback, and opinions on these or any other subjects via my
website
or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Niki

LOWELL SUN EDITORIAL
On Monday, December 2, the
Lowell Sun wrote an editorial about my efforts, in conjunction with
Governor Deval Patrick and former Senator Mo Cowan, to support and promote
Massachusetts military installations. In recent weeks top military
officials have visited the Bay State to see firsthand the amazing work
being done here.

Editorial
SUPREME COURT -
ACA
On November 26, the Supreme Court decided to hear two cases in
which two for-profit businesses are opposing the Affordable Care Acts
contraceptive-benefit. I understand that for many people this issue
brings up complicated moral and religious questions but I hope we can all
agree that we must work to improve the health of women. I believe the
best way to do so is by encouraging education, counseling, and by
providing women with access to preventative services. Birth control is a
vital part of womens health care and is covered by health plans free of
charge under the ACA, allowing a woman and her doctor
not her boss
or Washington politicians
to decide whats best. Whats at stake in
this case is whether for-profit companies or a woman herself is in
control of her health decisions. Empowering corporate CEOs to choose
which medications their health plans cover could lead to a very dangerous
precedent in which a womans health decisions are not her
own.
AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT UPDATE
Last week the Centers for Medicare
&amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that since the ACA was enacted,
more than 7.3 million seniors and people with disabilities who reached
the coverage gap, or donut hole in their Medicare Part D plans have
saved $8.9 billion on their prescription drugs, an average of $1,209
per person since the program began. Here in Massachusetts, that is more
than $141 million for more than 52,000 residents
a savings of $774
per beneficiary. This is more proof that the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
is delivering needed access to quality, affordable health care to
Americans.
