Friend
Last night, the House passed the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act ( H.R. 3230 ) with my support. This bill is a step forward, but it represents a tourniquet on a wound, not a cure to a disease. Much work remains to be done to rectify the situation, and I will continue to let nothing stand in the way of our priority of taking care of our nations heroes.
Yours in service,
Randy
