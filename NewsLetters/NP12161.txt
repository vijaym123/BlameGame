Dear Friend,
We are all familiar with identity theft when it comes to our credit
cards and bank accounts, but another type of ID theft is on the rise.
Over the last two fiscal years, the federal government has sentenced
661 individuals for ID theft tax refund fraud.
According to a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
(TIGTA) report released in November it states that some 1.6 million
Americans were victims of ID theft tax refund crimes in the first half
of 2013, up from 1.2 million in all of 2012.
Tax professionals predict this tax season will be no different when it
comes to victims of this type of criminal activity, which is why I
wanted to email you about it today as we are all starting to prepare
our returns.
Individuals who commit this type of crime usually make bogus filings
early in the tax season, when most Americans have yet to file their
taxes. According to the TIGTA report, scammers will typically file
electronic tax forms for IRS refunds using stolen names and social
security numbers. This potentially allows the theft to occur unnoticed
for weeks and even months before the victim files their legitimate tax
returns.
The IRS has implemented new processes to catch these illegal filings.
IRS Commissioner John Koskinen recently told Congress that they are
using data analytics to spot suspicious tax refunds and are screening
for refunds filed from the same address.
The art of ID theft in general is constantly evolving, and tax refund
fraud is one that all taxpayers should take seriously.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
We
are
all
familiar
with
identity
theft
when
it
comes
to
our
credit
cards
and
bank
accounts,
but
another
type
of
ID
theft
is
on
the
rise.
Over
the
last
two
fiscal
years,
the
federal
government
has
sentenced
661
individuals
for
ID
theft
tax
refund
fraud.
According
to
a
Treasury
Inspector
General
for
Tax
Administration
(TIGTA)
report
released
in
November
it
states
that
some
1.6
million
Americans
were
victims
of
ID
theft
tax
refund
crimes
in
the
first
half
of
2013,
up
from
1.2
million
in
all
of
2012.
Tax
professionals
predict
this
tax
season
will
be
no
different
when
it
comes
to
victims
of
this
type
of
criminal
activity,
which
is
why
I
wanted
to
email
you
about
it
today
as
we
are
all
starting
to
prepare
our
returns.
Individuals
who
commit
this

usually
make
bogus
