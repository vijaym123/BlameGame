The Senate is hanging in the balance. Whether we win depends on what you do in the next 3 hours. It&rsquo;s the most important deadline of the entire election!
ONLY 3 HOURS UNTIL THE FINAL AD BUY DEADLINE BEFORE THE ELECTION
Pitch in and we will TRIPLE-MATCH it &gt;&gt;
Friend -- The Senate is hanging in the balance.
Whether we win depends on what you do in the next 3 hours.
It&rsquo;s the most important deadline of the entire election!
We CAN win five Southern states and utterly transform the political landscape... but we&rsquo;re in danger of having all that RIPPED AWAY if you don&rsquo;t act and we can&rsquo;t counter the GOP&rsquo;s attack ads!
But if you DO contribute before midnight, we&rsquo;ll be able to FIGHT the false ads, ATTACK extremist GOP candidates on their home turf, and SEIZE the win on November 4.
Friend, we just need another $45,700 to meet our goal. Can you help?! It couldn&rsquo;t be more important! We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We know these emails can be a bit much -- thank you for reading them. But if we didn&rsquo;t send this and you missed out on giving, and that made us fall short of our goal, we&rsquo;d be utterly devastated. We know how badly you want Democrats to win this fall.
SO LET&rsquo;S DO IT. Let&rsquo;s hand the GOP a TRAGIC defeat. All gifts will be triple-matched until midnight!
Thank you, as always, for your help,
