Fellow Delawareans,
Right before the holidays, we had some
good news
in Delaware that I wanted to share. Congress passed a bill that will save 500 jobs in our state.
The legislation fixed an oversight in the Affordable Care Act that would have put American companies at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors and put 500 Delawareans out of work. Senator Carper, Senator Coons and I worked hard to get this bill across the finish line. As a result, 500 Delawareans had a happier holiday season.

to read a News Journal editorial that explains the bill in more detail.
As we start this new year, I promise to continue reaching across the aisle and doing the right thing for the people of Delaware.
Sincerely,
Please do not respond to this email.
