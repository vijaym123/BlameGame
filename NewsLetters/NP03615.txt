Dear
Friend,
Id like to take this opportunity to wish
you and your family a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. This is a
joyous time for Wisconsinites to be together with family and show our
gratitude to those we love. In that spirit, Id like to extend my
sincere gratitude for once again trusting me with the honor of representing
you and our great
city.
As we celebrate the birth of Christ, let
us remember the importance of his teachings. During this holiday
season, let us love our neighbors as we would love ourselves, feed the
hungry and look after the sick, and be our brothers and sisters keeper.
These values have guided me through critical votes in the halls of
Congress and tough decisions throughout my life. Regardless of our
beliefs, I hope these values will help motivate you to be better friends,
better parents, and better citizens.
If
youd like to volunteer and help the least fortunate among us during the
holidays, please visit our friends at the Volunteer Center of Greater
Milwaukee.
I look forward to continue working with you to
ensure that our district is prosperous and progressive in 2015 and beyond.
I wish you a happy holiday season and a peaceful and healthy
2015.
-Gwen

Attorney General Van
Hollen:
Drop the Frivolous
Lawsuit Against Immigration Executive Action
While it is clear that President
Obamas actions are well within his authority, State Attorney General
J.B. Van Hollen has instead decided to involve the state of Wisconsin
in a
political and frivolous lawsuit against the
President .
