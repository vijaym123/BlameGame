President Obama is Wrong on
Immigration
6/30/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the
following statement on President Obama's immigration policy
announcement:
The latest actions
announced by President Obama regarding immigration serve as yet another
showcase of an out-of-control presidency. We have a President who we
cannot trust to enforce the immigration laws already on the books. That
is why the House will not pass the Senate immigration amnesty
bill.
President Obama has created the humanitarian problems on our
southern border by proposing executive orders to loosen up our immigration
laws. To believe that he will address these problems with more
executive orders is insulting and should deeply concern the American
people.
I will continue to stand against amnesty and will continue to
advocate for more funding and troops at our southern border, as I
successfully did in the most recent Defense Appropriations
process.
