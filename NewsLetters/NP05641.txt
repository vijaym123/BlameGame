Take our 1 question survey &gt;&gt;
David --
I could go on and on about how amazing you all have been.
As you know, we&rsquo;re facing attacks from Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers, and Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s allies right now. But thanks to you, we&rsquo;re fighting Republican attacks on-the air, and running the most extensive get-out-the-vote program in our history.
It&rsquo;s great to know we have you in our corner.
You make our campaigns possible, so we want to run a campaign worthy of your contributions. Tell us your #1 issue in this election: http://action.dccc.org/2014-campaign-survey
Thanks again for everything you do to make our campaigns possible,
