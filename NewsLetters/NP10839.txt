Dear Friend,
The big news in the House this week is the 2015 budget released by
House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan. Mr. Ryan's budget is a wide-ranging
proposal that we're likely to vote on soon. Unfortunately, this budget
does not reflect the constructive, balanced and bipartisan approach
that I believe we need to move our country forward.
Tuesday, I sat down with constituents at Caf Nola in Frederick to talk
about bipartisanship and my work in the House of Representatives to
bring both parties together. During the town hall style event,
residents asked how our nation can enact meaningful legislation if
Congress can't find common ground. As a Freshman Class President, I've
worked to take the focus off partisan rhetoric and to highlight those
shared spaces where representatives can take action together to achieve
national priorities.
In the past year, I've introduced groundbreaking infrastructure
legislation with 30 Democratic and 30 Republican cosponsors to create a
national infrastructure fund at no cost to the taxpayer. I've also
hosted bipartisan discussions on issues ranging from our national debt
to innovation and U.S. competitiveness. I'm a strong believer that real
government reform starts when Members of Congress spend more time
listening to each other and less time grandstanding, a goal that's well
within our grasp.
While recent legislative compromises on the farm bill and on the budget
provide an opportunity this year for bipartisan work on some of our
nation's top priorities, recent congressional budget proposals have
instead focused on highlighting ideological divides between parties.
The Ryan budget, released this week, proposes cutting nutritional
assistance for 3.8 million families, reducing help for low-income
college students and making cuts to needed infrastructure investment.
While some of the budget's proposals might score political points, our
nation deserves a budget that takes a realistic look at our priorities
and makes a smart investment in areas that provide all Americans with
an opportunity to succeed in today's economy.
Having spent twenty years in the private sector as an entrepreneur and
CEO, I've acted as a strong voice for a budget that improves access to
education, rebuilds our crumbling infrastructure and provides emerging
American industries with the room and resources they need to grow.
Members on both sides of the aisle can agree that this kind targeted
investment is critical to our country's future. As I continue my work
to build bipartisan compromise on the budget and other issues, I look
forward to hearing from Members in both parties, and from you, on our
nation's biggest challenges.
Sincerely,
John

Delaney
April

Dear
Friend,
The
big
news
in
the
House
this
week
is
the
2015
budget
released
by
House
Budget
Chairman
Paul
Ryan.
Mr.
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
is
a
wide-ranging
proposal
that
we&#8217;re
likely
to
vote
on
soon.
Unfortunately,
this
budget
does
not
reflect
the
constructive,
balanced
and
bipartisan
approach
that
I
believe
we
need
to
move
our
country
forward.
Tuesday,
I
sat
down
with
constituents
at
Caf&#233;
Nola
in
Frederick
to
talk
about
bipartisanship
and
my
work
in
the
House
of
Representatives
to
bring
both
parties
together.
During
the
town
hall
style
event,
residents
asked
how
our
nation
can
enact
meaningful
legislation
if
Congress
can&#8217;t
find
common
ground.
As
a
Freshman
Class
President,
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
take
the
focus
off
partisan
rhetoric
and
to
highlight
those
shared
spaces
where
representatives
can
take
action
together
to
achieve
national
priorities.
In
the
past
year,
I&#8217;ve
introduced
groundbreaking
infrastructure
legislation
with
30
Democratic
and
30
Republican
cosponsors
to
create
a
national
infrastructure
fund
at
no
cost
to
the
taxpayer.
I&#8217;ve
also
hosted
bipartisan
discussions
on
issues
ranging
from
our
national
debt
to
innovation
and
U.S.
competitiveness.
I&#8217;m
a
strong
believer
that
real
government
reform
starts
when
Members
of
Congress
spend
more
time
listening
to
each
other
and
less
time
grandstanding,
a
goal
that&#8217;s
well
within
our
grasp.
While
recent
legislative
compromises
on
the
farm
bill
and
on
the
budget
provide
an
opportunity
this
year
for
bipartisan
work
on
some
of
our
nation&#8217;s
top
priorities,
recent
congressional
budget
proposals
have
instead
focused
on
highlighting
ideological
divides
between
parties.
The
Ryan
budget,
released
this
week,
proposes
cutting
nutritional
assistance
for
3.8
million
families,
reducing
help
for
low-income
college
students
and
making
cuts
to
needed
infrastructure
investment.
While
some
of
the
budget&#8217;s
proposals
might
score
political
points,
our
nation
deserves
a
budget
that
takes
a
realistic
look
at
our
priorities
and
makes
a
smart
investment
in
areas
that
provide
all
Americans
with
an
opportunity
to
succeed
in
today&#8217;s
economy.
Having
spent
twenty
years
in
the
private
sector
as
an
entrepreneur
and
CEO,
I&#8217;ve
acted
as
a
strong
voice
for
a
budget
that
improves
access
to
education,
rebuilds
our
crumbling
infrastructure
and
provides
emerging
American
industries
with
the
room
and
resources
they
need
to
grow.
Members
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
can
agree
that
this
kind
targeted
investment
is
critical
to
our
country&#8217;s
future.
As
I
continue
my
work
to
build
bipartisan
compromise
on
the
budget
and
other
issues,
I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
Members
in
both
parties,
and
from
you,
on
our
nation&#8217;s
biggest
challenges.
Sincerely,
John
