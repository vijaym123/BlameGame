Dear Friend, The Washington Post
is giving Republicans a 77% chance of taking over the Senate this November.
If you think that&rsquo;s bad, you really shouldn&rsquo;t look at the Post&rsquo;s predictions for the House -- they&rsquo;re giving the GOP a better-than-99% chance of retaining control of that chamber. Whatever else happens on November 4th, we need to take care of business here in Massachusetts. To finish this race strong, we need to raise $19O,OOO in October -- get us $5 closer to our goal now.

Or donate another amount.
The next few weeks aren&rsquo;t going to be easy. Democrats from coast to coast need to pull together and support candidates who will get Washington working again. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose another two years to Republican grandstanding and obstructionism. Help us sprint through the finish by making a $5 contribution.
With your support, we&rsquo;ll get the
Washington Post&rsquo; s numbers moving in the right direction.
Thanks,
Ed
