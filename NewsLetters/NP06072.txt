Highlights in the Legislative Program
[cid:image003.jpg@01CFD9B7.4AE57CF0]
Minimum wage goes up to $6.05 per hour on Tuesday. This is the sixth increase in seven years. The minimum wage has almost doubled since the federal government took over in 2007. The CNMI wage remains $3.05 per hour, however, unchanged since 1996almost 20 years ago. Because of the federal increase the wages of those earning minimum have stayed ahead of costs, according to the Government Accountability Office.
Minimum wage rises to $6.05 on Tuesday
Minimum wage workers in the Northern Mariana Islands will see a 50 increase on September 30. The new federal minimum wage of $6.05 per hour is almost double the wage set by CNMI law. Getting the increase right has been one of my toughest jobs as your representative in Congress. Workers tell me they worry that, if wages rise too quickly, they will lose their job or have their hours cut. Employers say they cannot invest in growing their business, when wages go up too fast. But my heart tells me that families need more money to meet their needs. I have amended federal law twice to stretch out the increase, relying on the economic analysis of the Government Accountability Office. GAOs March 2014 report
says that the inflation-adjusted earnings of minimum wage workers who retained their jobs and work hours rose by about 39 percent for the entire period from 2006 to 2012 and the hourly wage of minimum wage workers increased by more than inflation. As long as wages stay ahead of prices and the increases do not cost us jobs, I think we have the right policy in place.

NMI must stay focused on training U.S. workers
Saying there are not nearly enough unemployed U.S. workers to fill the jobs now held by foreign workers in the Northern Marianas, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has set the cap on CW workers
at 13,999 for FY15. This is virtually unchanged from the FY14 cap of 14,000 and almost 4,000 more than the number who were granted CW (Commonwealth-only Transitional) status in FY13. While investors and developers will be relieved that there will be ample labor available for hotels and other planned projects, we should not lose focus on the continuing need to train U.S. workers. According to the U.S. Department of Labor unemployed U.S. workers could fill as many as 20 percent of the available jobs, if the unemployed had the right skills. Our local government has the responsibility for using effectively the $1.5 million it receives each year in CW fees to train U.S. workers. And employers have the responsibility always to hire locals, if they have the skills and are ready to work. U.S. Public Law 110-229 still requires that there be zero CW workers by the end of 2019.

Protecting funding for community health centers
Finally getting approval for the Kagman Community Health Center was a major achievement for so many. Getting funding in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, to open and operate the Kagman Center in 2013 was equally important. Just last week Kagman was awarded $188,706
for this years operations. Thats why I joined over 200 other Members of Congress
in asking Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to act to protect the Health Center fund, which is scheduled to expire after fiscal year 2015. That would mean cuts of up to seventy percent for operational funding and could lead to closure of Kagman, staff layoffs, or a sharp reduction in service. I will keep working to prevent that from happening. People in Kagman, Papago, San Vicente, Fina Sisu, Dan Dan, Obyan, As Terlaje, and the surrounding areas can now rely on the new Kagman Community Health Center for primary and preventive care. We need it to remain open and even expand services.

Marianas Trench Monument Visitor Center planning moves forward
After holding a series of listening sessions in the Northern Marianas over the last week, the Marianas Trench Monument Advisory Council will issue a final report on plans for a Monument Visitor Center by December 19. The report will reflect public comments from the meetings on Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on the initial recommendation by the Council, regarding the mission and location of a Visitor Center and potential funding sources. The Advisory Council includes three officials from the Commonwealth Government and one representative each from the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard. They advise the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Monument management planning activities. I obtained a $220,000 congressional earmark
for Visitor Center planning in fiscal year 2010. The Commonwealth government used the money largely for an engineering assessment of the Navy Hill Lighthouse as a potential Visitor Center.

President Obama has expanded the boundaries of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument around Wake and Jarvis Islands and Johnston Atoll. Traditional fishing, consistent with the cultural practice of sustainable use, will continue in the area. There was concern that the Northern Marianas might somehow be affected. But White House officials informed me that there was never an intention to expand the Marianas Trench Monument that former Republican President George Bush negotiated with former Governor Benigno Fitial in the final hours of the Bush administration.
President protects more ocean areas for traditional use
President Obama created the largest marine reserve in the world on Thursday by signing an Executive Order expanding the boundaries
of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument
around Jarvis and Wake Islands and Johnston Atoll. The United States now joins the Republic of Palau and the Independent and Sovereign Republic of Kiribati as a leader in protecting ocean ecosystems under increasing pressure from climate change and resource extraction. Traditional fishing, which is rooted in the practice of sustainability and conservation for future generations, will continue to be allowed in the expanded Monument. Modern extractive activities, such as commercial fishing and deep sea mining, will be banned. The President announced in June that he was considering expanding the protected areas.
Before making any decision about the exact boundaries, though, he asked for input from fishermen, scientists, elected officials, and other stakeholders. After a well-attended town hall meeting in Honolulu and 170,000 comments from individuals, the President set the new boundaries as shown on the map above. In a statement, I applauded the Presidents decision , which protects the oceans so important to the culture and heritage of island peoples, and which he made in a way that respects the views of those of us who live in the Pacific.

Urgent climate change action needed to safeguard NMI
Action on climate change to safeguard the NMI
The United Nations convened an International Climate Summit this week with implications for the Northern Marianas. Rising sea levels that erode beaches, ocean acidification that eats away coral reefs, and changes in rainfall and storm intensity that endanger farmers, businesses, and homeowners all result from climate change. I am encouraged that the world may now be paying attention. Meanwhile, I have co-sponsored H.R. 764, the Coastal State Climate Change Planning Act , which would give the NMI and other vulnerable areas the resources we need to develop and implement strategies to reduce the impact of climate change.

$1,304,330 for NMI's Partnership for Success
The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation has received notice of $1,304,330 administered by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention in the Department of Health and Human Services. CHC will use the money for the Partnership for Success program, which addresses substance abuse through treatment and prevention. Congratulations to CHC.

$587,998 for STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program
The Commonwealth Justice Planning Agency is the recipient of $587,998 in federal funds for the STOP Violence Against Women program. STOP works for more effective law enforcement, prosecution, and court strategies in cases of violent crime against women and for development of victim services. Congratulations to CJPA.

$269,172 awarded for improvements at Northern Marianas College
The U.S. Department of Interior, Office of Insular Affairs has announced a grant assistance of $269,172 to the Northern Marianas College for capital improvement projects. These funds will be used for renovations on existing classrooms and office buildings at the Northern Marianas College to provide a more beneficial environment for learning. Congratulations to NMC.

$212,160 for Adam Walsh Act Implementation Grant Program
The CNMI Department of Public Safety was awarded $212,160 from the Adam Walsh Act Implementation Grant Program this week. The Adam Walsh Act is aimed at helping local governments sex offender registration and notification programs in conjunction with the national system for registration of those offenders. The funds will provide training for officers, computer hardware and software, and updated community notification systems. Congratulations to DPS.

$207,840 awarded for State Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Coalition Programs
The Northern Mariana Coalition Against Domestic And Sexual Violence also received funding to address violence against women. NMCADSV received $207,840 to support rape crisis centers, for training and technical assistance, to improve public awareness, and to pay for battered women's shelters. Congratulations to NMCADSV.
