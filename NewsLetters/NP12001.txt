This week, our carrier fleet was added to the list of programs to be cut from the militarys budget, continuing a troubling trend of applying a lowest-common-denominator approach to national security.
For the past 70 years, aircraft carriers have provided our nation with a powerful tool to project military power and an unrivaled means to demonstrate diplomatic resolve around the world. Given our global requirements, the Navy has frequently said we are an 11-carrier Navy living in a world that demands 15 carriers.
As part of the Defense Departments budget preview for Fiscal Year 2015, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that the USS George Washington (CVN-73) could be cut next year if sequestration continues, thereby reducing our nations fleet from eleven carriers to ten.
Question of the week:
Do you believe that reducing the carrier fleet will leave the United States less capable of meeting national security needs?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
