Blocking the Voice of the American People
The
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is one of the most important
pieces of legislation annually considered by Congress, authorizing the
funding of our armed forces and setting forth the policies to ensure that
our nation is secure. For nearly 50 years, both sides of the aisle and
both houses of Congress have put partisanship aside to carefully
consider the best way to ensure that our military has adequate resources
and our citizens are safe.
This year, however, without
warning or cause, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to allow for
adequate debate or an open process for amending the legislation,
breaking an important tradition that has been one of Congresss few bright
spots in recent years.
In the past decade, regardless of
which party was in power, the NDAA has been considered in the Senate for
an average of nine days with an average of 130 amendments considered
each year. But this year, after just two days of considering the bill
and voting on only two amendments, Reid filed a motion to end debate
on the legislation and block any other senator, Republican or Democrat,
from offering further amendments. This is a dangerous and unnecessary
new precedent to set when it comes to our national
security.
I wrote an op-ed in the Deseret News to explain how Harry Reid's
choice to abandon long-standing precedents in the Senate blocks the
voice of the American people in Washington.
My colleagues and I had
several amendments dealing with our due process rights, the NSA,
sanctions against Iran, and sexual assault in the military.
Regardless of where you stand on these issues, you deserve to have these issues
debated by your representatives in Washington.
I cannot
vote to support this legislation until my colleagues and I are allowed
to debate and amend it in a way that respects the normal democratic
processes that have worked well for almost 50 years.
