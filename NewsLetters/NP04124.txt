Wishing Everyone a Happy Thanksgiving
Today, I joined with dozens of volunteers at the Preble Street Resource
Center in Portland to help with the "Stuff the Bus" food drive that
will feed hundreds of hungry Mainers this holiday season. We have so
much to be thankful for in Maine, and this spirit of community and
generosity is really what Thanksgiving is all about.

Scenes from Maine
I was proud to welcome Admiral Jonathan Greenert, the Chief of Naval
Operations, to Bath Iron Works with Senator Susan Collins and
Congresswoman Chellie Pingree. He was impressed by USS Zumwalt and the
incredible men and women who built her.

Policy Update
*
Last Tuesday, the Senate voted on a bill that would have
greenlighted the Keystone Pipeline project before the Administration
concludes its environmental review. I listened to the arguments and
talked to my friends on both sides of the aisle, but I ultimately
couldn't support the bill. This is too important of an issue to
circumvent the proper review process. Read my full Keystone statement

The President announced last week that he will take executive
action to improve our immigration system. While I am a strong supporter
of comprehensive immigration reform and voted for the Senate bill last
year, I worry that by acting alone, the President could solidify
opposition and set the cause back. Read my thoughts HERE

This week, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced his
resignation. You can read my thoughts on that development HERE

Scenes from Washington
On Veterans Day, I was honored to place a wreath at the Maine column of
the World War II Memorial on the National Mall. Our veterans represent
the very best of our country, and I am deeply thankful for their
service. You can read my full Veterans Day statement HERE

I sat down with Einar Gufinnsson, the Speaker of Iceland's Parliament,
to discuss trade opportunities and the importance of the Arctic region.
Last year I traveled to the Arctic to observe and participate in a Navy
training exercise known as Ice Exercise (ICEX).
