A Busy Month for
Congress
House Passes Historic Water Bill
- On
May 20, the House of Representatives passed the
conference report to H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act of 2014 .
This long-awaited compromise passed with
flying colors in the House by a vote of 412 - 4 and will give the Army
Corps of Engineers the certainty and reforms it needs to effectively
improve and maintain our water
infrastructure.
Included in the bill are several provisions that will help
Wisconsin: 1) under the bill, the Great Lakes Navigation System will be
treated as one entity for consideration of projects, making Wisconsin
and other Great Lakes states more competitive against larger ports
elsewhere in the country, 2) the bill streamlines project approval times
and environmental reports that hold up projects for months or even
years at great expense, and 3)
I successfully included
two provisions
in the bill to give Wisconsin companies and local
government greater flexibility.
One provision will allow Burger
Boat in Manitowoc to continue expanding its pier in the Manitowoc
River, and the second deauthorizes federal control over the Burnham Canal
in Milwaukee so cleanup of the area can continue and the conversion to
a wetlands can begin.
It passed the Senate on May 22 and is
expected to be signed into law by President
Obama.
Bill to Limit NSA
Snooping, Protect Individual Privacy
- The House passed
Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner's (R-WI) bill,
the USA
Freedom Act , on May 22.
I cosponsored this legislation with
Rep. Sensenbrenner which will end the bulk collection of Americans
records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
It creates a new,
narrowly-tailored authority for the collection of call records and imposes
new limitations and safeguards to protect civil liberties while
preserving national security capabilties.
While I had some concern
about changes that were made to the final version of the bill, ultimately
it represents an improvement over the current
situation.
Accountability for the
VA
- No veteran should
die waiting for service and care at a VA facility.
Recent reports
of patient deaths while awaiting care and "secret lists" are
unacceptable.
We need more than words to show accountability and ensure
these gross examples of mismanagement are not repeated.
On May
21, the House passed
H.R. 4031, the Department of
Veterans Affairs Accountability Act , which allows the VA to fire or
demote officials at the Department who aren't doing their
jobs.
National Defense
Authorization
- On May 22, the House passed the Fiscal
Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act which provides authority and
directives to our nation's armed forces.
The bill ensures our
troops in the field have the support they need to succeed in their
mission.
I was glad to support passage of this bill -- which has
been passed on a bipartisan basis for 52 years straight -- by a vote of
325 - 98.
Human
Trafficking
- On May 20, the House passed
six bills to help end human trafficking, condemn the kidnapping of over
200 girls in Nigeria, support victims of trafficking, and increase
penalties for those who engage in sex trafficking in the United States.
Unfortunately, these horrible crimes are still being committed
around the world and in our own backyard.
I
joined with my colleagues
in supporting these enforcement measures so
that violators can be brought to justice and victims can be
supported.
Benghazi
- On May 8, the House voted to create a select
committee to investigate the September 12, 2012, attacks on the
American consulate in Benghazi, Libya where four Americans lost their lives.
Previously, I cosponsored Congressman Frank Wolf's (R-VA) bill
to create a select committee, and I joined the majority of my
colleagues in voting to pass this measure because a U.S. Ambassador and
three other Americans were killed in an attack where the circumstances
are not fully clear or explained.
I think we owe the
families of those Americans who died that day a full explanation of what
happened.
Its quite clear that there was considerable confusion
on the Administrations part in the aftermath, and it has been charged
that officials focused more on playing politics before an election
than investigating.
Others are saying there were requests for more
protection at the consulate.
There are just
too many unanswered questions
for this to be dismissed.
On May
21, Democrats appointed members to the select committee making it
bipartisan.
Charter
Schools
- As one of the early
supporters of charter schools, I was proud to support
H.R. 10, the
Success and
Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act , which will
strengthen and expand access to the successful Charter School Program.
The bill supports
state efforts to start, expand,
and replicate high-performing charter schools.
This bill passed
the House 360 - 45 and now goes to the Senate for
consideration.
A Memorial Day
Message
This
Monday, May 26, we honor our nation's veterans and our servicemen and
women who have given their lives defending our country.
From the American Civil
War to the beaches of Normandy, and from the jungles of Vietnam to the
deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan, brave men and women from Wisconsin
have circled the globe to protect and defend the United States against
forces of evil and tyranny, wherever they may be.
The sacrifices
made by our soldiers in uniform, and their supportive families back
home, have preserved our freedom and made us all
safer.
Thank you for all youve done to protect our
country.
