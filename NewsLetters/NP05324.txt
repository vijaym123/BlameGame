I
participated in the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations hearing on the Ebola outbreak.
Americans are
questioning what the government is doing to stop the spread of Ebola in
our country and they deserve answers to their questions.
In
August 2014, two American health care workers returned to the U.S.
after working in Africa and contracting the Ebola virus.
Both
patients were transported under very strict isolation measures and treated
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at an isolated
facility.
Following treatment, both patients responded favorably
to experimental drugs administered by the CDC.
Recently Thomas
Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas, Texas, and passed away due
to the disease, and there are now two health care workers who treated
Duncan battling Ebola.
As a member of the Oversight
and Investigations Subcommittee, it is my responsibility to hear what
the CDC, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security and other agencies are doing to prevent further
spread of this virus.
My constituents want to know why a travel ban
has not been instituted and our borders have not been secured.
They also are questioning why the government does not have one
centralized location for treatment of Ebola patients returning to the United
States.
During the subcommittee hearing I
admonished people for their collective lack of respect for the two dedicated
health care workers battling Ebola. We should not call them Nurse
One and Nurse 2; Nina Pham and Amber Vinson are dedicated health care
workers who have families and friends concerned about their
wellbeing; they deserve to be shown respect.I also questioned CDC Director Dr.
Frieden on why travel restrictions have not been implemented.
I
told him I predict the government is going to put travel restrictions
in place at some point; travel restrictions are coming and I think we
need them now rather than later.
Americans have a right to
be concerned about the Ebola outbreak.
I am hopeful the recent
hearing will help alleviate some of their concerns about actions taken
or not taken to protect them.
It is imperative our country takes
aggressive steps to stop the Ebola outbreak.
