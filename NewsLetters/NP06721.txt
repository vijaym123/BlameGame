Currently, the corporate tax rate in the United States is
35%
(over 39% with local and state taxes) and is the
highest
of any country in the industrialized world.
Additionally,
unlike other countries , U.S. corporations are not just taxed on their activity inside our borders, they are taxed on the income they earn all over the world.
In order to reduce their tax burden, some U.S. companies use an inversion, which is when they acquire or merge with a company overseas, and reorganize in a country with a lower tax rate.
Inversions allow companies to transfer money earned abroad to the new parent company without being subject to U.S. taxes.
Some
argue that inversions allow American companies to overcome these tax disadvantages in order to compete in a global market, while
others
believe it is unpatriotic to move companies overseas and this is simply a tax loophole that should be closed.
This week, Burger King announced it was entering into a deal to buy Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee and doughnut shop.
In doing so, Burger King would create
a new corporate parent
of both companies, with its headquarters in Canada.
Recently,
Walgreens
announced a similar move to buy a Swiss company, Alliance Boots, and relocate its headquarters overseas; however, after facing criticism, the company is now pursuing the merger without an inversion, keeping its headquarters in the U.S.
