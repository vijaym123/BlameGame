 of 815,900 individuals.
*
Nationwide, about 13 million have gotten coverage under the
Affordable Care Act so far, with more than 8 million signed up
for health insurance on state and federal
marketplaces, and 4.8 million through Medicaid and Children's Health
Insurance Program enrollment growth.
*
The Affordable Care Act is also helping save money by reducing
hospital readmission rates
. From 2011 to
2012, reductions in drug events, falls, infections, and other forms of
harm prevented nearly 15,000 deaths in hospitals, avoided 560,000
patient injuries, and approximately $4 billion in health spending.
*
Health care costs are growing at the slowest level on record
. In
fact, 2012 was the first year since 1997 that health expenditures
didn't outpace gross domestic product.
*
And the nonpartisan polling firm Gallup found the number of
uninsured Americans is the lowest they've ever recorded
.
The bottom line, as President Obama said: "This thing is working."
We're one big step closer to an America where there is truly
opportunity for all.
I'll keep you updated as the implementation of this historic law moves
ahead.

GEORGE MILLER

Dear
Friend,
There
have
been
a
number
of
encouraging
developments
with
the
Affordable
Care
Act
I
want
to
make
sure
you
know
about.
Following
the
first
ever
open-enrollment
period,
which
ran
from
October
through
mid-April,
here
are
a
few
highlights: Covered
California,
the
state's
new
online
health
insurance
marketplace,
signed up
nearly
1.4
million
people
for
health
insurance.
Another
1.5
million
enrolled
or
have
been
deemed
eligible
for
expanded Medi-Cal,
the
state's
Medicaid
program
for
lower-income
people.
This
enrollment
surpassed
California's
initial
enrollment
goal
of
815,900
individuals. Nationwide,
about
13
million have
gotten coverage under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
so
far,
with
more
than
8
million
signed
up
for
health
insurance on
state
and
federal
marketplaces,
and
4.8
million
through
Medicaid
and
Children's
Health
Insurance
Program
enrollment
growth.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
also
helping
save
money
by
reducing
hospital
readmission
rates . From
2011 to
2012,
reductions
in
drug
events,
falls,
infections,
and
other
forms
of
harm
prevented
nearly
15,000
deaths
in
hospitals,
avoided
560,000
patient
injuries,
and
approximately
$4
billion
in
health
spending. Health
care
costs
are
growing
at
the
slowest
level
on
record .
In
fact,
2012
was
the
first
year
since
1997
that
health
expenditures
didn't
outpace
gross
domestic
product. And
the
nonpartisan
polling
firm
Gallup
found
the
number
of
uninsured
Americans
is
the
lowest
they've
ever
recorded .
The
bottom
line,
as
President
Obama
said:
"This
thing
is
working."
We're
one
big
step
closer
to
an
America
where
there
is
truly
opportunity
for
all.
I'll
keep
you
updated
as
the
implementation
of
this
historic
law
moves
ahead.

GEORGE
MILLER
