President's Budget Protects Social Security
Dear Friend,
Some very good news for Social Security recipients. At the urging of
many of us in Congress, President Obama has just announced a proposed
2015 budget that protects Social Security benefits by rejecting the
idea of tying yearly adjustments to the Consumer Price Index, or CPI.
In the strange language of Washington, the plan the President wisely
dismissed - which still enjoys wide support from the House Majority -
is called "Chained CPI." Chained CPI would have reduced yearly
increases in benefits low-income Social Security recipients urgently
need just to make ends meet.
For example, under Chained CPI, a retiree receiving $9,600 in benefits
per year would lose about $140 annually between the ages of 62 and 81.
That $140 is money typically spent for heat, groceries and other
necessities of life.
You've probably heard me say this before. Social Security (and
Medicare) are not entitlements. They are earned benefits we pay into
from our first day on the job. There are plenty of good places to cut
spending and work toward a balanced budget, including an end to wars of
choice and nation building abroad we can't afford. Cutting Social
Security benefits to seniors, veterans, and disabled individuals is not
one of them.
I and other Members of Congress urged the President to protect Social
Security last week - you can read the letter we sent him here
I'm glad he listened, and glad to begin our week with some good news.
You have a great week as well.
Sincerely,
_____
Great Lakes Restoration = Green Jobs for the Northland
Duluth is on track for more green jobs, thanks to a new $250,000 grant
through the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative. Duluth was picked to be the very first of 16
cities nationwide to receive a new "Shoreline Cities Green
Infrastructure Grant," which will fund stormwater management projects
at the Lake Superior Zoo and two local parks. As a result, stormwater
runoff will be cleaned and filtered before being released into the St.
Louis River or the Lake Superior Basin.
Since coming to Congress, I've made job-creating grants like this one a
top priority here in the 8th District. While some states receive $4-5
in federal project funding for every dollar they send to Washington in
taxes, Minnesota only receives about 65 cents. Last year, our office
helped bring home more than $62 million Minnesota tax dollars,
including $3 million to help clean up the St. Louis River, and $10
million to repair and expand Duluth Harbor. These solid investments
help drive the commerce, tourism, and outdoor recreation that add so
much to our northern Minnesota economy.
Talking Transportation Jobs and Highway Funding in North Branch

Highway, road, and bridge improvements, and the good-paying jobs those
projects mean for central and northern Minnesota, were on everybody's
mind as we joined with the Minnesota Transportation Alliance on
February 15th for a roundtable discussion packed with local residents,
officials, and business leaders.
The federal transportation authorization law expires this coming fall.
As a member of the House Transportation Committee with jurisdiction
over this area, I explained that this critical legislation marks the
centerpiece of our bipartisan effort to redirect our nation's
priorities homeward and rebuild an American infrastructure desperately
in need of repair.
Specifically, the bill funds maintenance, improvements, and expansion
of our nation's rail systems, airports, highways, roads, bridges,
inland ports, harbors, and other transit systems. As we begin crafting
a new transportation bill, I will be doing everything in my power to
assure that northern Minnesota - with the special challenges our
weather extremes pose - is well represented. Click here
to read coverage from our
roundtable in the Isanti County News.
Something's Got to Give:
Cars, Shoppers, Snow Piles, and Logging Trucks
Vie for Space on Duluth Streets
Speaking of special weather challenges (and as you can see from the
above photo taken last Friday after Minnesota's latest mega snowstorm),
logging trucks that exceed federal weight limits for nearby I-35 still
pose a big hazard as they detour through downtown Duluth. The truckers
don't like this situation. And neither do the shoppers, businesses, and
other vehicles competing for space on slippery, narrow streets.
The solution - at least for the short term - is a federal weight limit
exemption allowing the trucks to use I-35. To that end, I am working
with my Republican colleague from Wisconsin, Rep. Sean Duffy, to
introduce legislation granting Secretary of Transportation, Anthony
Foxx, the same type of authority to issue weight exemptions for limited
stretches of federal highways in extraordinary circumstances, similar
to what our governors already have to issue weight exemptions for state
highways.
I will keep you posted as events develop. Meanwhile, click here

Sunday's edition of the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
A Fond Farewell to Joan Mondale
Vice President Joe Biden, his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, Mary, and I
disembark from Air Force Two on our way to services honoring Joan
Mondale earlier this month. Joan passed away on February 7th.
(Official White House photo)
Mary and I were honored to accompany Vice President and Mrs. Biden to a
wonderful service of remembrance for Joan Mondale at Westminster
Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. Joan, who met her husband of 59
years, former Vice President Walter Mondale, on a blind date, was such
a tireless advocate for the arts that her nickname became "Joan of
Art." With that in mind, former President Jimmy Carter urged us all to
follow Joan's example and "Live your life as though it is a work of
art."

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
President's
Budget
Protects
Social
Security
Dear
Friend,
Some
very
good
news
for
Social
Security
recipients.
At
the
urging
of
many
of
us
in
Congress,
President
Obama
has
just
announced
a
proposed
2015
budget
that
protects
Social
Security
benefits
by
rejecting
the
idea
of
tying
yearly
adjustments
to
the
Consumer
Price
Index,
or
CPI.
In
the
strange
language
of
Washington,
the
plan
the
President
wisely
dismissed
&#8211;
which
still
enjoys
wide
support
from
the
House
Majority
&#8211;
is
called
"Chained
CPI."
Chained
CPI
would
have
reduced
yearly
increases in
benefits
low-income
Social
Security
recipients
urgently
need
just
to
make
ends
meet.
For
example,
under
Chained
CPI,
a
retiree
receiving
$9,600
in
benefits
per
year
would
lose
about
$140
annually
between
the
ages
of
62
and
81.
That
$140
is
money
typically
spent
for
heat,
groceries
and
other
necessities
of
life.
You&#8217;ve
probably
heard
me
say
this
before.
Social
Security
(and
Medicare)
are
not
entitlements .
They
are
earned
benefits
we
pay
into
from
our
first
day
on
the
job.
There
are
plenty
of
good
places
to
cut
spending
and
work
toward
a
balanced
budget,
including
an
end
to
wars
of
choice
and
nation
building
abroad
we
can&#8217;t
afford.
Cutting
Social
Security
benefits
to
seniors,
veterans,
and
disabled
individuals
is
not
one
of
them .
I
and
other
Members
of
Congress
urged
the
President
to
protect
Social
Security
last
week
-
you
can
read
the
letter
we
sent
him
here .
I&#8217;m
glad
he
listened,
and
glad
to
begin
our
week
with
some
good
news.
You
have
a
great
week
as
well.

Duluth
was

stormwater
runoff
will
be
cleaned

before
being
released
into
the

they
send
to
Washington
in

Minnesota
only
receives
about
65

Last
year,
our
office
helped
bring
home
more
than
$62
million
Minnesota
tax
dollars,
including
$3
million
to
help
clean
up
the
St.
Louis
River,
and
$10
million
to
repair
and
expand
Duluth
Harbor.
These
solid
investments
help
drive
the
commerce,
tourism,
and
outdoor
recreation
that
add
so
much
to
our
northern
Minnesota
economy .

Speaking
of

challenges
(and
as
you
can
see
from
the
above
photo
taken
last
Friday
after
Minnesota&#8217;s
latest
mega
snowstorm),
logging
trucks
that
exceed
federal
weight
limits
for
nearby
I-35
still
pose
a
big
hazard
as
they
detour
through
downtown
Duluth.
The
truckers
don&#8217;t
like
this
situation.
And
neither
do
the
shoppers,
businesses,
and
other
vehicles
competing
for
space
on
slippery,
narrow
streets.
The
solution
&#8211;
at
least
for
the
short
term
&#8211;
is
a
federal
weight
limit
exemption
allowing
the
trucks
to
use
I-35.
To
that
end,
I
am
working
with
my
Republican
