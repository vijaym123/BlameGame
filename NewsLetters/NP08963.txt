Rep. Cuellar Calls for Multi-Agency Border Processing Center to Deal with Overcrowding at the Border
In recent weeks, the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas has experienced an unprecedented influx of apprehensions, many of which are unaccompanied children. These crossings have created a resource crisis in the Rio Grande Valley that demands immediate attention from the federal government and the Appropriations Committee.
That is one of the reasons why I sent a letter this week to Secretary Johnson and the Appropriations Committee calling for the establishment of a multi-agency processing center on the border.
It is necessary to create a central location in which all elements of the adjudication process can be completed.
Read the full text of my letter
here .

Rep. Cuellar Statement on Resignation of Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Veterans deserve peace of mind in their health care system and the highest level of care at any facility.
Secretary Eric Shinseki should be commended for his years of service to our country, both in the armed forces and the Administration, but this is a needed change. It is clear that a change in the culture at the VA is overdue.
Congress needs to work across the aisle to reform the VA in a way that will address deficiencies and provide better delivery of services to our veterans.
It is vital that we get to the bottom of the ongoing issues that have interfered with the VAs mission of providing top level healthcare services.
At the end of the day, every veteran deserves the highest quality of care and I will work with colleagues to ensure that these problems are resolved.
Watch some of my comments calling for VA accountability here:
Rep. Cuellar speaks to Univision Noticiero about the ongoing issues surrounding the VA.
He expressed concern about the allegations at various VA facilities across the country and called for a culture change at the agency.
