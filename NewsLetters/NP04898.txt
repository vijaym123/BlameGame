We have only 72 hours left to save the Senate -- and TEN races are still virtually tied.
Friend -- We have only 72 hours left to save the Senate -- and TEN races are still virtually tied.
This election has consequences beyond 2014: Georgia GOP candidate and master jobs outsourcer David Perdue recently admitted that &ldquo;If [Republicans] don&#39;t win the Senate... it could be 10 years&hellip; with Democratic leadership in the Senate and the White House.&rdquo;
Even Republicans admit:
If you step up today,
we could set the GOP back for a DECADE
by winning RED states like Georgia and Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s Kentucky.
But if you sit this one out and we fall short, McConnell would take control. Progressive policies would end. We&rsquo;d get two years -- or more -- of obstruction and shutdown threats.
