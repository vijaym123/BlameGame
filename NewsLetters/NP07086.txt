&ldquo;Cruz, who took the stage to rousing applause, laid out seven recent conservative victories &ndash; among them, the defeat of gun control legislation [and] the Supreme Court&rsquo;s

MSNBC , 8/10/14
Dear Friend, Does the phrase &ldquo;Majority Leader Ted Cruz&rdquo; scare you?
It probably should -- in his short time in the Senate, Cruz has made it clear that nothing comes before the needs of his Tea Party base.
Ted Cruz led the charge to shut down the government, and if his Tea Party allies pick up six seats this November, he could be in charge of the Senate.
We&rsquo;re not going to let one of those six seats come from Massachusetts -- chip in $5 toward our $25,000 pre-primary filing deadline and help us keep fighting.

Cruz is perhaps the most visible -- and politically successful -- example of what I call the Republican Paradox. Cruz hates government, but he has to run for office to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t work, because if it turned out that government could make someone&rsquo;s life a little better, Ted Cruz&rsquo;s whole political philosophy would fall apart.
We know for a fact that government can be a force for good. That&rsquo;s why we fight to defend Social Security, which seniors have earned and depend on. That&rsquo;s why we protect the National Institutes of Health from the Tea Party&rsquo;s proposed cuts. That&rsquo;s why we continue to push for action on climate change. Ted Cruz knows that he has to make government fail to prove his point. We can&rsquo;t let him and his party become the majority in the Senate. Give $5 and help us reach our $25,000 goal by midnight on Wednesday.
Thank you for standing up for a government that works.
