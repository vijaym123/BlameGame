Friend,
I'm honored to have the opportunity to represent my neighbors in the Hudson Valley for another two years.
Thank you to the thousands of folks who have reached out to me with ideas and suggestions over the past two years.
Despite Washington gridlock we have worked together and gotten results for our farmers, veterans and small businesses, and our results came directly from your ideas.
As the 113th Congress winds down and the 114th Congress begins, I want to hear from you about what you think Congress should focus on, so please take a minute and fill out the survey below. I look forward to hearing from you!
What should Congress focus on in the upcoming weeks?
Passing a budget
Lowering energy costs
Fixing our broken immigration system
Investing in transportation and infrastructure
Reforming the tax code
Other
Sincerely,
Sean Patrick Maloney
