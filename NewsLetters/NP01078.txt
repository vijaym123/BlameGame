Dear Fellow Nevadan,
The
month of May provides Americans the opportunity to reflect upon and
celebrate the many contributions made by the Asian-American and Pacific
Islander community to Nevada and our country. This strong and diverse
community has played an instrumental role in Americas development.
Members in the AAPI community have shaped America through their work as
civil rights activists, rail-road workers, farmers, scientists,
entrepreneurs, artists and public servants. They have excelled in commerce,
the arts, medicine, law, government and academia. America is a better
place thanks to the AAPI community and their
accomplishments.
Today, the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in America
is vibrant. Our country is enriched with over 16 million people
representing 45 different ethnic groups and 28 languages, and Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders make up one of the most dynamic and fastest
growing populations in Nevada. I am grateful for the vital role they
play in Nevadas economic and cultural development.
As we
celebrate and recognize the achievements of the AAPI community, this
month also reminds us to reflect on the challenges still faced by AAPI
communities. I will continue to work in Congress to represent the needs
and interests of all members of the AAPI community. Earlier this year I
joined my colleague Senator Mazie Hirono in fighting for legislation
that would reunite children and families of Filipino World War II
veterans. I am proud to represent more than 100,000 Filipino-Americans in
Nevada and I will continue my steadfast support of family
reunification efforts this Congress. I also will not stop fighting for the passage
of comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families across
Nevada and our nation together and will make the American dream a
reality for all. As we begin May, I join my fellow Nevadans in celebration
and extend my best wishes for a joyous Asian-American And Pacific
Islander Heritage Month.
