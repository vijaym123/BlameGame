It seems that with each passing day, more troubling
stories emerge concerning the Presidents health care law. Unfortunately,
these stories only serve to tell us what we already know: this law is
simply unworkable and is causing more harm than
good.
Obamacare's disastrous rollout caused
millions
to lose their health insurance, despite the
President's
promise
that if you liked your
healthcare plan you could keep it. Then,
security risks
and serious glitches in the Obamacare marketplace website put thousands
of Americans personal information at risk and delayed Americans
ability to comply with Obamacares
mandates.
The administration was hoping for a quick turnaround
after attempting to address these issues, but more information has
surfaced that the turnaround is not any better. A recent
report
released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that
the law discourages work and will drive over 2 million people out of
their full-time jobs over the coming years. Equally troubling, the
report
projects there will still be 31 million
uninsured Americans even with Obamacare's full implementation. With millions
of hard-working families facing higher premiums and higher
deductibles under Obamacare, the CBO
report
further proves
that the law is not working as intended and the future does not look
any better.
I will continue
to urge the President to recognize the hardships the American people
are facing as a result of this law. At the end of the day, the American
people dont want more politics -- they want
solutions.
While I believe that the Presidents
healthcare law is the wrong approach to addressing the challenges facing
our healthcare system, as your voice in Washington it is not only my
priority but also my job to represent you and your interests. Please
take the time to answer the question below so I can better serve
you.
Do the recent CBO findings that Obamacare will result in fewer
full-time employees make you more or less likely to support the
law? Less - Obamacare is not
working and we need to address these serious problems More - We need to continue to show our
support for this law Unchanged - This report did not convince me one way or
another *By
