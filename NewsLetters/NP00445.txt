Dear Fellow Nevadan,
During
LGBT Pride Month we celebrate the activism and courage of millions of
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.
LGBT
Americans have stood up to demand equal justice under the law. And when
Democrats controlled Congress, we listened. I was so proud to vote to
repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell, to vote for the Matthew Shepard and James
Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act and the Ryan White CARE Act and for
the passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in the
Senate.
Im happy to say that now, 70 percent of Americans live
in a state where loving same-sex couples can legally marry, including
Nevada. In March, it gave me great pride to join over 200 Members of
Congress in filing an amicus brief urging the Court to stand for equal
justice under the law. I hope the Justices recognize the dignity and
uphold the equality of these unions.
However, though there
have been strides toward equality, so much more must be done. LGBT
Americans are still discriminated against today in housing, in securing
credit and can still be fired from their jobs for simply being honest
about who they are. Thats wrong and I will continue to fight alongside
the LGBT community to stop it and ensure their equal rights.
