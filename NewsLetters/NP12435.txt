Dear
Friend,
We all look forward to a bright future in Utah and
across our country. One component of our collective success will be a
steady stream of jobs and career opportunities. What I have learned about
the jobs of tomorrow is that there is no doubt they will require strong
academic foundations, especially in the subjects of science and
math.
To that end, I have worked hard in Congress to bring
attention to the importance of prioritizing science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) education. Last year, I worked with my colleagues
in the House of Representatives to pass H.Res.77, the Academic
Competition Resolution of 2013. This bill establishes an annual STEM
competition to encourage high school students in their studies.
This
month, I invite all high school students in Utahs Fourth
Congressional District to participate in the first annual Congressional STEM
Academic Competition. Participants will be asked to create an original
application (app) for a smartphone, tablet, or computer to be judged by
experts in STEM related
fields.
GUIDELINES
The contest is open to all high school students
who reside in Utahs Fourth Congressional District.
Participants may compete individually or in groups of up to 4
students.
The deadline to submit an entry is April 30, 2014 @ midnight
EST.
Each entry must include a short video of the app
along with the source code to be inspected by the judges.
Winners from each district will be recognized on the House of
Representatives website, House.gov, and put on display in the U.S.
Capitol

I look forward to seeing what Utah
students develop as they build their own products and begin invaluable
training for the future. The competition is only a start in expanding
STEM education, and one step toward strengthening the future of American
innovation. As a member of the STEM Ed Caucus in the U.S. House of
Representatives, I will continue to work with my colleagues on policies
that encourage our young people to pursue careers in science,
technology, math, and engineering related fields.
I am honored to
serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours. As your
representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and
issues affecting you and our community.
Please let me know
know areas you find especially
interesting or where I can provide you with additional information. I value
your ideas and look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
