Dear Friend, This coming week, on April 15th, it will once again be Tax Day.
As most American taxpayers finish their tax filings and prepare to send their information to the IRS, my colleagues and I on the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee will be bringing multiple bills to the House floor to rein-in IRS abuse. One of these will be my bill to prevent wrongful leaks of private citizens' tax information and to provide greater transparency to leak victims --
the Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act . Also next week, the House of Representatives will consider legislation to repeal the federal death tax. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill along with many other members of the Pennsylvania congressional
delegation. It is strongly supported by t he Pennsylvania Farm Bureau,
the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association,
the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association,
the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry,
and many other important groups. The story of America is one of men and women working hard and sacrificing to provide a better life for their children and grandchildren. The death tax intrudes on that story and is an assault on our national character. Whether it's a mother's savings, a father's business, or a family's farm, the government should not be inheriting what rightly belongs to successive generations. Currently, more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive to the second generation, and 90 percent of family businesses do not survive to the third generation. According to a study by former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the elimination of the death tax would create 1.5 million additional small business jobs and would shave almost a full percentage point off the national unemployment rate.

Rep. Kelly Applauds National Park Service for Conducting Reconnaissance Survey of
Washington Trail - 1753
Kelly had personally requested survey from US Dept. of Interior
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement yesterday commending the National Park Service (NPS) for agreeing to conduct a reconnaissance survey of the
Washington Trail - 1753
in Western Pennsylvania, which will determine if the trail resources "merit further consideration as a potential unit of the National Trails System." The NPS's decision letter to Rep. Kelly can be viewed
here .
"I am wholeheartedly appreciative of the NPS's decision to conduct a reconnaissance survey of this revered historic trail. The trail serves as an exciting bridge to pre-revolution America and commemorates George Washington's first-ever military and diplomatic venture. All Western Pennsylvanians should be proud that this special landmark is now one step closer to being officially recognized as a National Historic Trail."
NOTE:
On February 11, 2015, Rep. Kelly sent
a letter
to Jon Jarvis, Director of the U.S. Department of the Interior, requesting that the NPS undertake a reconnaissance survey to "identify the nationally significant route and resources associated with the Washington Trail - 1753" and to "determine whether the corridor merits future designation as a National Historic Trail."
On July 30, 2014, Rep. Kelly sent
a letter
to the NPS in support of the grant application previously submitted by the Washington Trail - 1753 for Community Assistance through the NPS Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance (RTCA) program. The letter, along with three other letters in support of the project (including one to the Honorable Martin O'Brien, Chairman of Washington Trail - 1753), can be viewed
here . On November 18, 2014, the NPS
announced
its decision to provide assistance.

On Thursday, April 2nd, Rep. Kelly attended a press conference hosted by
Hyundai Hope on Wheels
at the 2015 NY Auto Show during which the
organization announced that it has now raised more than $100 million to
fight pediatric cancer.
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
"As a founding board member of Hope on Wheels, I couldn't be prouder
or more appreciative of this outstanding accomplishment in the name of
such a heroic cause. During last week's event, I had the privilege of meeting
with several childhood cancer survivors, including
Bri Commerford, a former intern in our DC office and Hope on Wheels
Youth Ambassador. I was also pleased to present the organization with an official
Congressional Commendation for the tremendous work they do to end this
horrific disease.
"All
cancer patients deserve the utmost compassion from all of us, and thanks
to groups like Hope on Wheels, the most vulnerable among us have more
care and resources on their side than ever before. This fight will not
end until the words 'Your child has cancer' are never heard again."
