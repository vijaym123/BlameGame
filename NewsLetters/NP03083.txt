Dear
Friends,
It is a new year and with that comes the highly
anticipated new Republican-led Senate. With this new Congress, my
colleagues and I are working to restore transparency and regular order, and
this started with how the Senate handled S.1, legislation to approve the
Keystone XL pipeline. As a testament, the Senate voted on
41 amendments to S.1 in the first three weeks, far outpacing the 15
amendment votes permitted in all of 2014. My colleagues and I are
committed to getting Washington working again for Americans. Keystone
passed the Senate Thursday by a vote of 62 to 36, and you can read more
about this job-creating
legislation by clicking

Last week, as senior
member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I also had the opportunity
to participate in a committee hearing titled
Global Challenges and
the U.S. National Security Strategy,
with the following
witnesses in attendance: Dr. Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State; Dr.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State; and Dr. Madeleine Albright,
former Secretary of State.
With some of
the greatest foreign policy and defense leaders in recent history
testifying before the hearing, the nation was reminded that the
greatest vulnerability to our national security is the lack of strategy
from the Obama Administration. With a comprehensive
strategy, based on all the possible threats against our security, Congress
would be better equipped to debate and address funding levels for our
national security and approve adequate resources for our service
members tasked to carry out missions across the
globe.
Instead, the threat of ISIS
continues to grow and evolve; Putin and Russian-supported rebels continue
to threaten Ukraines stability; Iran continues its efforts to develop
a nuclear weapon as well as sponsors international terrorism; and
Boko Haram continues to murder and kidnap Africans in large droves. As
Reagan once put it, we need a strategy for strengthening peace and the
resources that tell the world America should be taken
seriously.
With that
said, I would like to hear from my fellow
Americans:
National Security 2015 Do you feel that our nation is secure
from global threats?
Yes No How do you feel about
legislation to authorize use of military force (AUMF) against
ISIS? The President should put
forward an AUMF for Congress to review Congress should be the first to put forward an AUMF
The President has the
authority under former AUMFs to be conducting operations against
ISIS The United States
should not be fighting ISIS Should Congress repeal President Obamas $487 billion
in defense department cuts
termed as defense
sequestration? Yes, without strings
attached Yes, but the end of
these cuts should be offset with tax increases Yes, but the end of these cuts should be
offset with entitlement reform Yes, but the end of these cuts should be offset with cuts in
non-defense spending No,
these cuts should remain in place *By answering this survey, you
