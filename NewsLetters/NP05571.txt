David, I need your urgent help.
Polls show us in a dead heat against Republican Bob Dold. It's just one more piece of evidence that our race will go down to the wire.
In 2012, we won by only 1 percent. This year, the
Washington Post
named me one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country. I can't win without your help. Will you please join me?

David, I'm fighting every day for the priorities you care about most -- from growing our economy and expanding on-the-job training, to protecting women's health care rights and banning workplace discrimination against LGBT employees.
But if Illinois's 10th District falls back into Republican hands, all the progress we've made could come to a screeching halt. Let's keep fighting. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/23-Days-to-Go
