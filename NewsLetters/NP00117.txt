Opening Foreign Markets for Kansas Farmers and
Businesses

Last Friday, the House of Representatives
passed
Title I of the Trade
Act
with my support by a vote of 219-211. This legislation
grants the same trade promotion authority to President Obama that every
president for the last 50 years has received, but with stricter
oversight guidelines.
Before voting on trade promotion authority, I
went down to the classified briefing room at the Capitol and read the
draft text of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. I believe every
American should have the ability to read the text of any future trade
agreements, and this legislation ensures this type of transparency
exists.
In this modern, global economy, one in
five American jobs is tied to trade. That amounts to about 38 million
jobs across America that pay, on average, 18 percent more than non-trade
jobs. In the Third District alone, there are over 136,000 jobs tied
to trade. In an era where jobs are hard to come by and wages have
stagnated, these sustainable, high-paying jobs are essential to
jumpstarting our economy.
Furthermore, 95 percent of the worlds customers live beyond our
borders. This bill gives our negotiators the leverage they need to break
down barriers between American manufacturers, small businesses, farmers,
and ranchers like those in Kansas who benefit from open access to
these new markets.
However, it
also has over 150 provisions that gives Congress a stronger oversight
role over the Administration as it negotiates the Trans-Pacific
Partnership or any future free trade agreements,
including:
Allowing Members of Congress to read TPP and attend
negotiating rounds as advisors.
Outlining opportunities for
Congress to provide guidance to American
negotiators.
Requiring the President to publish the text of the trade agreement after
it is finished and allowing 60 days for the public to review the deal
before Congress votes on whether to approve
it.
Setting objectives in negotiating for the administration to pursue,
including rules for agriculture, human rights protections, and prevention
of currency manipulation.
Allowing Congress the
authority to revoke trade promotion authority at any time if the
administration feels to meet the obligations outlined in this
bill.
The bottom line is this bill stikes the right balance between
exercising Congress' constitutional authority over trade and empowering
our negotiators to strike a deal that will be help Americans find the
high-paying jobs they demand, and that is why I was proud to support
its passage.

Combating
ISIS
Click to watch a video of Congressman Yoder
discussing the ISIS threat with Stuart Varney on
Fox Business
Network .
Last week, President Obama told the media at a
press conference in Europe that the United States does not have a
"complete strategy" for defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria
(ISIS) at this time. I was deeply disappointed by this statement, and
believe it sends the wrong signals to Americans at home, our allies abroad,
and ISIS itself.
Last September, President Obama
promised to degrade and destroy ISIS. Nine months later, we've witnessed
ISIS overrun Ramadi, a major city and gateway to Baghdad, and President
Obama himself admits the training of Iraqis is barely
underway.
Right now, we are not taking a serious approach to achieving
that goal. It's time for the President to make the case before the
American people and the Congress as to why ISIS is a threat to our
national security and what the strategy is to defeat
it.
Increasing Pay for Our Hardworking Men and Women in
Uniform
In a world where threats to our
security continue to emerge in the Middle East in the form of ISIS
and around the world in would-be aggressors like Iran, Russia, and North
Korea, providing our defense community with the capability to meet
its demands is more important than
ever.
Last week, the House passed the
2016 Defense Appropriations Bill
by a vote of
278-149, with my support. This bill responsibly provides funding to
keep our nation safe at home, support our military engagements abroad,
and maintain and improve the vital healthcare and benefits programs
our servicemembers have earned through their
sacrifice.
This bill follows the road map approved in the House
and Senate balanced budget agreement, providing $578.6 billion in
discretionary funding for the Department of Defense and $88.4 billion for
the Global War on
Terrorism.
Military Personnel and Pay
$133.2 billion
$122.8 billion
in base funding and $10.5 billion in GWOT funding
to provide for
1,308,915 active-duty troops and 819,200 Guard and reserve troops. This
funding level is $225 million above fiscal year 2015, and provides
critical support for the Global War on Terror and the defense of our
nation.
The bill fully funds the authorized 2.3 percent pay raise for
the military, instead of 1.3 percent as requested by the President, and
provides funding to maintain 100 percent of troop housing costs
through the Basic Allowance for Housing
(BAH).
Operation and Maintenance
$218.8 billion
$162.3 billion in
base funding and $56.5 billion in GWOT funding
for operation and
maintenance, $6.2 billion above the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and
$2.6 billion above the Presidents request. This funding supports key
readiness programs to prepare our troops for combat and peacetime
missions, including flight time and battle training, equipment and facility
maintenance, and base
operations.
Research and Development
$67.9 billion
$66.2 billion in base
funding and $1.7 billion in GWOT funding
for research, development,
testing, and evaluation of new defense technologies. This is $4 billion
above the fiscal year 2015 level.
Equipment
Procurement
$116.7 billion
$98.6 billion in base funding and
$18.1 billion in GWOT funding
for equipment and upgrades. This is
$12.5 billion above the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $3 billion
above the Presidents request.
Defense Health
and Military Family Programs
$31.7 billion
$667 million
below the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $813 million below the
request
for the Defense Health Program to provide care for our troops,
military families, and retirees. While below the current year, this
level is sufficient to meet the entire scope of all estimated needs and
requirements in the next fiscal year.
Investing in Our Infrastructure to Grow Our Economy
Late Tuesday evening, he House of Representatives passed
the
2016
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations
Bill
by a vote of 216-210 with my support. This bill prioritizes
funding for our critical transportation projects to encourage economic
growth and efficiency in government. It also supports core housing
programs for our nations most vulnerable citizens. Given our current
budgetary environment, the bill makes responsible choices to reduce spending
in lower-priority areas.
Transportation
The bill includes $17.2 billion in discretionary appropriations
for the Department of Transportation for fiscal year 2016. This is $1
billion below the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $6.8 billion below
the Presidents request.
Highways
$40.25 billion for the Highway Trust Fund. This is equal to the
fiscal year 2015 level.
Air
$15.9 billion for
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
$159 million above the
fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $40 million above the
request.
Rail
$1.4 billion for the Federal Railroad
Administration. $262 million below the fiscal year 2015 enacted
level.
Transit
$10.7 billion for the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA)
$161 million below the fiscal year 2015 enacted
level.
Maritime
$361 million for the
Maritime Administration, $19.8 million above the fiscal year 2015 enacted
level.
Safety
$837 million in total
budgetary resources for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA), $572 million for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, and $227 million for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration.
Housing and Urban
Development (HUD)
The legislation includes a total of $42
billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an increase
of $1 billion above the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $3 billion
below the President's request.
Section 8 and Public
Housing
$26.8 billion for Public and Indian Housing. This
is an increase of $353 million above the fiscal year 2015 enacted
level and $2 billion below the requested level. Funding will continue
assistance to all families and individuals currently served by this
program.
Making Transporting Custom Harvesting
Equipment Easier
Also included in the THUD Appropriations
Bill was my amendment that will allow the Kansas Legislature to
modify its truck length laws for hauling custom harvesting equipment
through Kansas.
The bills passage
with my amendment means farmers in Kansas are one step closer to being
able to transport their custom harvesting equipment across the state
more efficiently without having to sacrifice on safety. My amendment
will help bring our truck length laws in line with Oklahoma and Nebraska,
which will be a shot in the arm for our Kansas economy without
increasing federal spending or adding to our National
Debt.
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to include
this provision in its version of the bill as the appropriations process
continues.

Congressional Baseball
Game
Last Thursday, the Republicans took on the Democrats
in the annual Congressional Baseball Game to benefit local charities.
Each member donned the uniform of a local university or professional
baseball team, and I proudly wore my Kansas Jayhawks uniform.
Unfortunately, the Republicans were defeated in a close 5-2
game.
But more importantly, proceeds from the game
will benefit The Washington Literacy Council, The Boys and Girls Club
of Greater Washington, and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation.
I always enjoy participating in the game, especially to help these
great causes.

Ensuring the Safety of Police Officers and Our
Community
Last week, the House of Representatives passed
H. Res. 295 , a
resolution introduced by Congressman Al Green (D-TX) that I cosponsored
along with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver II (D-MO) regarding body cameras
for police officers, by a vote of 421-6.
Our resolution states
that that the House:
Recognizes all law enforcement
agencies and officers for their tireless work to protect us and make
our communities safer.
Recognizes the potential for the
use of body-worn cameras by on-duty law enforcement officers to improve
community relations, increase transparency, and protect both citizens
and police.
Encourages State and local law enforcement
agencies to consider the use of body-worn cameras, including policies
and protocols to handle privacy, storage, and other relevant
concerns.
This resolution sends a clear message that the House
supports the safety and security of both our brave men and women in the
police force and the members of our communities across the country.
During a time where relations between law enforcement and citizens
across the country are sadly strained, Im proud to join with Congressman
Cleaver to show our constituents in the Kansas City area that this
issue is not a partisan issue, but one that we can all get
behind.
Fact of the Week
In Kansas,
84% of the 3,387 businesses that exported goods in 2012 were small and
medium-sized businesses.
Happy Flag Day
Every year on June 14, Americans celebrate the day that the
Continental Congress adopted the official flag of the United States in
1777. Since that date, the stars and stripes of the American flag has
been known as a symbol of freedom and democracy around the world, and
continues to be so today.
Happy Flag
Day!
