Dear Friend,
This week, I voted against the Republican
Work Harder for Less Budget because of the devastating impacts it
could have on the people of New York.
The Republican budget is an
attack on Americas hard-working families all for the sake of giving
bigger tax breaks to the super-wealthy.
It tells Americans:
work harder to keep less.
On the other hand, House
Democrats have put forward a budget that invests in the hard-working
families who are the backbone of our country.
Our budget calls
for tax reform that will reward hard-working Americans through new tax
credits and deductions, makes college more affordable, invests in our
childrens education, fuels research and innovation, and creates
good-paying jobs building and modernizing the nations
infrastructure.
It's time for Republicans to stop stacking the deck against
hard-working families. Democrats will continue the fight to ensure the
American Dream is a reality for everyone.
On Thursday, I
hosted a Twitter chat with representatives from the American Heart
Association, American Diabetes Association, and the NYC Department of
Health
to discuss how maintaining
a healthy lifestyle can help curb and fight preventable
illnesses . You can read the synopsis

Your opinion is valuable to me. So please
visit my website at
www.Rangel.house.gov
for more information, and to engage with me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's
always a great honor serving you.
Best
regards,
Charles B. Rangel
