Dear Friend,
In politics, you often hear about legislation once it's done.
A member
of Congress puts out a press release, maybe you read a story in the
local news - either way, you see the final product, but rarely get a
glimpse of the work that went into it.
Today, I wanted to change that by giving you a behind-the-scenes update
on a piece of legislation that I introduced last year with Republican
Congressman Tom Reed from New York. It's called the Revitalize American
Manufacturing and Innovation (RAMI) Act - or H.R. 2996, in official
Congressional terms. Put simply, this bill would create a network of
regional manufacturing institutes across the country. You can read more
about the policy details here
, but today I wanted to give you a sense of how we
try to move a bill like this through Congress - easily one of the most
interesting and challenging things I've done since being sworn in.
Let's start at the beginning.
Where did the idea for this bill come
from? Well, my district in Massachusetts is home to several former
industrial cities and towns that have suffered mightily from the
downturn in traditional manufacturing. Helping businesses, workers and
educators in these communities adapt to an economy that is increasingly
globalized, high-skill, and high-tech is absolutely critical to their
continued recovery and growth.
With that goal in mind, my office spent several months last summer
developing the substance of this bill with staff from the House Science
& Technology Committee. Then, we sent our content over to the Office of
Legislative Counsel, which takes ideas and puts them into legislative
language.
After weeks of going back and forth with new thoughts and
edits, the bill became something we could all be proud of - a bill that
Republicans and Democrats alike could get behind.
As you know, that's
no easy task!
On August 1, 2013 we took that bill down to the House
floor and introduced it in the 113th Congress.
Over the last eight months, there's been slow but steady progress. Last
December, Congressman Reed and I appeared at a hearing before the
Science & Technology Committee, where we testified alongside business
and industry leaders in support of the bill. President Obama has
repeatedly mentioned RAMI as a top Congressional priority, including in
his State of the Union address this January. We've also worked hard to
secure the endorsements of major manufacturing industry groups, which
is especially critical to the most important task of all - collecting
co-sponsors.
Signing up co-sponsors can happen any number of ways. Usually it's
Congressman Reed or me approaching a colleague in between votes or in
the hallway, armed with information about how our bill will help not
just the country's economic growth, but their district in particular.
To date, we've signed up over 50 co-sponsors.
Most significantly,
they're almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. In
today's divided Congress, that's not something you see every day.
We
believe it's a real testament to the fact that this bill will help
local economies from Indianapolis to San Francisco, Fall River to
Little Rock.
As this bill progresses through the House, we are lucky to have
Senators Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Roy Blunt from Missouri moving a
companion bill through the Senate. Now, there's no guarantee our bill
will pass - or even get a vote - but our goal is to get it to President
Obama's desk this year, and we're doing everything in our power to make
that happen.
Hopefully this didn't put you to sleep! But for everything you hear
these days about our system not working or being gridlocked to a halt,
I thought it might be nice to know that there are places where the
simple, unglamorous, everyday work of setting policy is chugging along.
Slowly, yes, but surely.
Thanks for taking the time to read this. As always, don't hesitate to
drop me a line.
All my best,
Congressman Joe Kennedy

Dear
Friend,
In
politics,
you
often
hear
about
legislation
once
it's
done.
A
member
of
Congress
puts
out
a
press
release,
maybe
you
read
a
story
in
the
local
news
&#8211;
either
way,
you
see
the
final
product,
but
rarely
get
a
glimpse
of
the
work
that
went
into
it.
Today,
I
wanted
to
change
that
by
giving
you
a
behind-the-scenes
update
on
a
piece
of
legislation
that
I
introduced
last
year
with
Republican
Congressman
Tom
Reed
from
New
York.
It&#8217;s
called
the
Revitalize
American
Manufacturing
and
Innovation
(RAMI)
Act
&#8211;
or
H.R.
2996,
in
official
Congressional
terms.
Put
simply,
this
bill
would
create
a
network
of
regional
manufacturing
institutes
across
the
country.
You
can
read
more
about
the
policy
details
here ,
but
today
I
wanted
to
give
you
a
sense
of
how
we
try
to
move
a
bill
like
this
through
Congress
&#8211;
easily
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
challenging
things
I've
done
since
being
sworn
in.
Let's
start
at
the
beginning.
Where
did
the
idea
for
this
bill
come
from?
Well,
my
district
in
Massachusetts
is
home
to
several
former
industrial
cities
and
towns
that
have
suffered
mightily
from
the
downturn
in
traditional
manufacturing.
Helping
businesses,
workers
and
educators
in
these
communities
adapt
to
an
economy
that
is
increasingly
globalized,
high-skill,
and
high-tech
is
absolutely
critical
to
their
continued
recovery
and
growth .
With
that
goal
in
mind,
my
office
spent
several
months
last
summer
developing
the
substance
of
this
bill
with
staff
from
the
House
Science
&amp;
Technology
Committee.
Then,
we
sent
our
content
over
to
the
Office
of
Legislative
Counsel,
which
takes
ideas
and
puts
them
into
legislative
language.
After
weeks
of
going
back
and
forth
with
new
thoughts
and
edits,
the
bill
became
something
we
could
all
be
proud
of
&#8211;
a
bill
that
Republicans
and
Democrats
alike
could
get
behind.
As
you
know,
that's
no
easy
task!
On
August
1,
2013
we
took
that
bill
down
to
the
House
floor
and
introduced
it
in
the
113th
Congress.
Over
the
last
eight
months,
there&#8217;s
been
slow but
steady
progress.
Last
December,
Congressman
Reed
and
I
appeared
at
a
hearing
before
the
Science
&amp;
Technology
Committee,
where
we
testified
alongside
business
and
industry
leaders
in
support
of
the
bill.
President
Obama
has
repeatedly
mentioned
RAMI
as
a
top
Congressional
priority,
including
in
his
State
of
the
Union
address
this
January.
We've
also
worked
hard
to
secure
the
endorsements
of
major
manufacturing
industry
groups,
which
is
especially
critical
to
the
most
important
task
of
all
&#8211;
collecting
co-sponsors.
Signing
up
co-sponsors
can
happen
any
number
of
ways.
Usually
it's
Congressman
Reed
or
me
approaching
a
colleague
in
between
votes
or
in
the
hallway,
armed
with
information
about
how
our
bill
will
help
not
just
the
country's
economic
growth,
but
their
district
in
particular.
To
date,
we've
signed
up
over
50
co-sponsors.
Most
significantly,
they're
almost
evenly
split
between
Democrats
and
Republicans.
In
today's
divided
Congress,
that's
not
something
you
see
every
day.
We
believe
it&#8217;s
a
real
testament
to
the
fact
that
this
bill
will
help
local
economies
from
Indianapolis
to
San
Francisco,
Fall
River
to
Little
Rock.
As
this
bill
progresses
through
the
House,
we
are
lucky
to
have
Senators
Sherrod
Brown
from
Ohio
and
Roy
Blunt
from
Missouri
moving
a
companion
bill
through
the
Senate.
Now,
there&#8217;s
no
guarantee
our
bill
will
pass
&#8211;
or
even
get
a
vote
&#8211;
but
our
goal
is
to
get
it
to
President
Obama's
desk
this
year,
and
we&#8217;re
doing
everything
in
our
power
to
make
that
happen.
Hopefully
this
didn&#8217;t
put
you
to
sleep!
But
for
everything
you
hear
these
days
about
our
system
not
working
or
being
gridlocked

Slowly,

don't

me
a
