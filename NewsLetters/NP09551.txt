&ldquo;The Koch brothers&rsquo; main political arm intends to spend more than $125 million this year on an aggressive ground, air and data operation benefiting conservatives&rdquo; --
Politico,

Dear Friend,
The Koch brothers are willing to do just about anything to make their agenda a reality. We take them seriously because many Americans can&rsquo;t turn on a TV without seeing one of their political ads.
The amount of money these two brothers have spent on influencing our elections is utterly staggering --
more than $300 million in 2012.
And according to that report, just one of their many outside groups, Americans for Prosperity,
is planning to spend $125 million this time around.
We cannot allow these big oil billionaires to dominate our national conversation.
We need to raise $20,000 by the end of May -- and that only gives us a little more than one week to get there. Can you give $5 or more right now?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Ed is the guy who fights the Koch agenda. He wants climate change legislation that puts the reins on carbon emissions and unleashes a new economic era in clean energy jobs. He wants to raise the minimum wage and build ladders of opportunity for American families to climb into the middle class.
Why are the Kochs willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars?
To defeat Democrats like Ed.
Because if Democrats lose control of the Senate, the Kochs are one step closer to having their extreme agenda become the law of the land.
Ed will make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen -- but he can&rsquo;t do it alone.
We are a part of this fight, too. Help Ed fight back by giving $5 or more toward our $20,000 goal.
Thanks for your support.
