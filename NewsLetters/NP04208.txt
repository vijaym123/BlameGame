Well once again the boarding pass is printed and
Im heading back home to the promised land of Texas. Im looking
forward to Thanksgiving, and by the way, no one on earth has more to be
thankful for than those of us who are blessed to live in the great state
of Texas.
As you know, last week the
House passed a bill to authorize the construction of the Keystone XL
Pipeline by a bipartisan vote.Unfortunately,
the measure
did not pass
the Democrat-controlled Senate. The Senate was
unable to gain the 60 votes the bill needed to break a filibuster. Once
again a bill that we need to create jobs for Americans was blocked by
extreme environmentalists in the Senate. Hopefully we will be able to
resolve this in the next Congress when Republicans assume control of the
Senate.
Last night, the President decided
to sidestep the Congress and the will of the American people and
issued executive action on immigration. The Presidents executive order
will shield up to five million illegal immigrants from deportation and
allow them to stay in the country illegally and receive work permits.
This action
adds as many new immigrant workers to the
nations labor force as the total number of jobs created since he
took office . This policy is bad for the American people, and the
President is putting the concerns of illegal immigrants in front of
American citizens.
Congressman Joe Barton
(R-TX06) and I
sent a letter to the President
demanding that he work with Congress on fixing our immigration system instead
of issuing an executive order, but he did not listen, nor did he
listen to the American people when they spoke on November 6 th .
The House of Representatives is now looking at all options to stop the
President and undo the damage he has done.
I am confident we
will be able to reign in this out of control President and his executive
overreach, and get Washington working for the American people
again.
I wish all of you a very blessed
Thanksgiving and remember, especially during these troubling times, to be
thankful for what you have been given by the good Lord. Happy Thanksgiving
to everybody. I get back to D.C. after Thanksgiving on Monday,
December
