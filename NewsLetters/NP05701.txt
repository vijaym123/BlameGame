Answered President Obama's call-to-action? ## NO DONATION ## FINAL FEC DEADLINE
RASMUSSEN REPORTS: Democrats up 2 points in race for Congress 41%-39% 9/29-10/5 -- 3500 Likely Voters -- sampling error for the survey is +/- 2 percentage points
The latest poll showing Democrats up 2 points? IT&rsquo;S WRONG.
Sure the results might be real, but there&rsquo;s no way that can hold up through Election Day. Not with everything Republicans are doing to buy this election: FIRST:
Republicans launched the biggest ad blitz of the election this week ($1O MILLION). THEN:
Their SuperPAC allies surprised us with even MORE attacks ($3.7 MILLION). NOW:
Karl Rove piled on yesterday with even more ($1.7 MILLION).
That all happened THIS WEEK. And honestly, it&rsquo;s been devastating. That money is already tipping this election to the Republicans.
David, we hate having to deliver bad news -- but control of Congress is at stake. President Obama&rsquo;s last two years are at stake. And supporters like you are all we have left.
So thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done. Truly, you make our campaigns possible. But we need your help one last time:
