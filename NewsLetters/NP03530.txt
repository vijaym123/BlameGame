Congressman
Lamborn Supports the Hire More Heroes
Act
1/6/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported the Hire More Heroes Act, the
first piece of legislation passed in the 114th
Congress.
"It was an honor to cosponsor and support
this important bill designed to incentivize businesses to hire more
veterans. By allowing employers to not count veterans in the VA or
TRICARE systems against Obamacare's employer mandate, businesses will have
a lower tax burden if they employ veterans. Unemployment among our
veterans is too high. The Hire More Heroes Act is an important first
step in addressing the twin problems of onerous Obamacare mandates and
veteran unemployment and I look forward to its passage in the
Senate."

(CO-05)
