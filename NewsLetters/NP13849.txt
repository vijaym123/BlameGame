Each year at Thanksgiving, we are reminded to take pause in our busy
lives and give thanks. We give thanks for those around us; we give
thanks for what we have been given; we give thanks for new
opportunities.
As we practice gratitude this year, let us acknowledge all of our
blessings, both big and small. Let us remember the liberties afforded
to us by our men and women in uniform and let us reflect on those who
have paid the ultimate price for our freedoms. May we be mindful of
those less fortunate and may we walk with a spirit of appreciativeness.
Today as I reach out to you with a full and grateful heart, my hope is
that you provide extended warmth to your loved ones and that you take
an extra moment to reflect on your community and the generosity from
within it.
Have a wonderful and blessed holiday.
Congressman Stephen Fincher

Each
year
at
Thanksgiving,
we
are
reminded
to
take
pause
in
our
busy
lives
and
give
thanks.
We
give
thanks
for
those
around
us;
we
give
thanks
for
what
we
have
been
given;
we
give
thanks
for
new
opportunities.
As
we
practice
gratitude
this
year,
let
us
acknowledge
all
of
our
blessings,
both
big
and
small.
Let
us
remember
the
liberties
afforded
to
us
by
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
let
us
reflect
on
those
who
have
paid
the
ultimate
price
for
our
freedoms. May
we
be
mindful
of
those
less
fortunate
and
may
we
walk
with
a
spirit
of
appreciativeness.
Today
as
I
reach
out
to
you with
a
full
and
grateful
heart,
my
hope
is
that
you
provide
extended
warmth
to
your
loved
ones
and
that
you
take
an
extra
moment
to
reflect
on
your
community
and
the
generosity
from
within
it.
Have
a
wonderful
and
blessed
holiday.
