Friend,
We are in the midst of California&rsquo;s worst drought ever and there&#39;s no telling how long it will last.
Californians are doing their part to conserve and continue to make daily sacrifices, but that may not be enough. It&#39;s critical that Congress takes concrete steps to combat climate change -- or the situation will likely get worse.
Sign your name: Tell Congress to protect our environment and families by addressing climate change now.
The science is clear: our climate is changing and this drought is hurting families, small businesses and farmers throughout California.
Yet in Congress, there are still folks who deny that climate change exists at all.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you to sign this petition: it&#39;s time that Congress takes action to address climate change before the situation gets worse.
We cannot wait.
Make sure your voice is added--sign your name here.
Be well,
Ami
