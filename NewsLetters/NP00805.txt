Dear Fellow Nevadan,
This week marks the 52nd
anniversary of the National Small Business Week. Small Business Week
provides us with an opportunity to celebrate the ingenuity and
entrepreneurial spirit small business owners in Nevada and across our nation
possess. Small businesses are critical to Nevadas economic growth. They
empower our states workforce and bring diversity to the industries
and sectors that call Nevada home.
Today I congratulate the
ten Nevada Small Business Award recipients during National Small
Business Week. Our state is stronger thanks to all of your hard work and
dedication.
