-- Voting has started in almost every state.
-- One week from today, voting ends.
-- There are 32 too-close-to-call races.
Bottom line: the playing field is huge -- and volatile. But on Election Day, there won&rsquo;t be any more polls or undecided voters. Democrats will win. Or Republicans will win. And we&rsquo;ll all live with those consequences.
David -- This is our FINAL week ad buy deadline. If you&rsquo;ve been planning to answer President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action, please contribute today -- while you can still make a difference:
