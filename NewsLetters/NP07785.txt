Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. I appreciate being able
to share news and updates from Washington and at home with you
directly.
I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to come and be a
part of an event to honor Vietnam War era veterans at 10 AM on
Saturday, August 2 in Columbia. We will be honoring veterans with a
special ceremony, and all those who served during the Vietnam War era
will receive a pin and certificate commemorating their service and
sacrifice.
Veterans, their families, and all who wish to honor them
are invited to attend. You can call
844-820-0146 or visit
www.scott.senate.gov/veterans
to RSVP or learn more. I hope to see you there!
Fighting Big Government
Families and small business owners have to spend their money carefully
and make sure that their budgets balance each year. The federal
government should be bound by the same rules. I am committed to
fighting big government, and making Washington play by the same rules
that everyone else does.
For that reason, I have supported legislation that cut over $138
billion in federal spending in 2013. Read more about it here

Immigration Questions
I remain very concerned about the prospect of unaccompanied minors
being housed in South Carolina. Our office has not received information
regarding any proposed plans to do so. However, we continue to be
vigilant and inquire of various federal and state agencies to ensure
that if such a decision is made, South Carolina and our public
officials are fully informed of the details.
While this continues to be a humanitarian crisis, frankly exacerbated
by President Obama and his administration's lack of action for weeks,
ultimately the federal government must not house undocumented,
unaccompanied minors in communities throughout the country without
working in close collaboration with public officials and communities.
Sadly, this administration has shown an unwillingness to do that.
As such, my staff and I are currently reaching out directly to
officials at the various agencies overseeing these operations and
requesting a full briefing.
At the same time, a number of ideas continue to move through the
legislative process and I will give serious consideration to them,
should they reach the Senate Floor.
It is an honor to serve as your United States Senator. Your feedback is
very important to me as I work to do the very best job possible in
representing the people of South Carolina. You can send me an email
here
, or give my office a call at
202-224-6121 with your thoughts.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
