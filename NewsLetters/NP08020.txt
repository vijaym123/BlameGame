Dear
David,
As we celebrate our nation's independence, we also remember the
many sacrifices made, and the lives lost, so we can enjoy the
freedoms that continue to make America great.
We live in a nation
that uniquely offers great liberties and opportunities that we enjoy
each and every day. America is rich in history, and our founders fought
for the rights and liberties that we are proud to stand for today -
and that many in this world look up to.
Today, our brave men
and women in uniform - and their families - continue to make
sacrifices to protect these rights. As you celebrate this special weekend,
please take a moment to give thanks to our active duty and retired
servicemembers - as well as their loved ones - who continue to make
sacrifices to defend and protect America.
