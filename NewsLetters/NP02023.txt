Standing up for 316,000 American
workers
On Wednesday, the Energy &amp;
Commerce Committee held a hearing to discuss the benefits of my coal ash
legislation. Our plan would give assurances to workers threatened by vague
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations on coal
ash.
316,000 Americans depend on coal ash for their livelihood
manufacturing everyday products like drywall and concrete. We need to
ensure these people are not hurt by the EPAs misguided regulations. As the
Wheeling Intelligencer
put it , our bill will
safeguard the public - and avoid loss of as many as 316,000 jobs that
would have been affected by the initial plan.

from the hearing:
Modernizing Medicare
Medicare is an
important program for seniors, and this week I introduced legislation to
strengthen it. The Bundling and Coordinating Post-Acute Care Act
(BACPAC) will strengthen Medicare by improving care for seniors through
private-sector "care coordinators" who will ease the decision-making
process after a hospital stay.
This bipartisan legislation will
also save as much as $50 billion. By enacting these improvements, we
can give seniors piece of mind about their own care and the health of
the Medicare system. Read more about the bill

Bringing Accountability to the
EPA
This week, the House passed two bills to ensure the EPA
is open and transparent about their scientific findings. Under the
Obama Administration, the EPA has become more partisan and ideological.
Their politicized activism is undermining their credibility and
encouraging bad regulations.
My amendment to the EPA Science
Advisory Board Reform Act would prohibit those who write EPAs rules from
receiving money from EPA contracts and grants. By requiring a three
year cooling off period, we can assure the advisers maintain their
impartiality.

Building Bridges on
Energy
The annual gathering of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Edison Energy Institute brings
together energy and labor leaders to discuss the issues facing the
industry. On Tuesday, I was honored to speak to the gathering about the
future of the power industry and the challenges faced by
overregulation.
The statistics are startling
the EPAs own estimates show
their clean power plan will shut down 50 gigawatts of coal power in
the next 5 years. Thats on top of the 60 GW shutting down due to the
EPAs mercury and air toxic standards. Thats a total of 110 GW of lost
capacity
in a country that creates only 300 GW.
What
does that mean? It means that on the coldest days in January, or the
hottest days in July, our power grid is more likely to fail because of
misguided EPA regulations. It means that fewer jobs will be created here
in America as manufacturers move overseas. And it means continued
reliance on foreign countries for our energy needs.
I will
continue to fight these regulations and protect Americans from the EPAs
dangerous ideology.
All Cost, No Benefit with the
EPA
In a hearing this week on the EPAs plans
to shutdown coal power plants across the nation, we discussed the
benefits and costs of their plan. Their plan would shut down power
plants, kill jobs, and drive manufacturers overseas, but for what
benefit?
