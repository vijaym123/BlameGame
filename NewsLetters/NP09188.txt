Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Happy Birthday, Kentucky! Today the Commonwealth celebrates its
official day of statehood, as 222 years ago on June 1, 1792, Kentucky
was admitted as the 15th state in the Union.
I look forward to working this week in the Commonwealth and visiting
with folks across the Sixth District.
Honoring Those Who Made the Ultimate Sacrifice for Our Freedom
I was honored to participate in several Memorial Day services to honor
those American patriots who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the service
of their nation, including the Anderson County Memorial Day Event, the
Midway Memorial Day Ceremony, and the Memorial Day event at The
Lexington National Cemetery.
It is too often too easy to take for granted the blessings of liberty
secured by these heroes. We commemorate with picnics and barbecues,
ceremonies and parades. But we must never forget the true meaning of
this day. We're the land of the free...because we're the home of the
brave.
As President Ronald Reagan famously said, "Freedom is never more than
one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children
in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for
them to do the same."

Signature Industry Spotlight: Fighting for Kentucky Agriculture
I am pleased that on Thursday, the House passed an amendment I helped
introduce to prohibit the use of Drug Enforcement Administration funds
to further inhibit the progress of Kentucky's industrial hemp research
projects being conducted across the Bluegrass.
I believe industrial hemp holds much promise for Kentucky farmers as
they seek new, alternative markets and additional agricultural
opportunities. The amendment, which passed with bipartisan support
Thursday evening by a vote of 246 to 162, is a simple, direct
legislative remedy that will hopefully send a clear message from
Congress that these pilot projects are sanctioned, important, and a
critical step toward reintroducing industrial hemp to the American
agricultural mix.
Last summer, when the House amended the Farm Bill to include language
that would allow universities and state departments of agriculture to
grow and research industrial hemp, I was optimistic about the
tremendous opportunity the amendment provided Kentucky Farmers and was
pleased to support it. That amendment allows researchers an opportunity
to explore the feasibility and economic potential of reintroducing hemp
into America's agricultural mix. In addition, the pilot projects serve
as a gateway for farmers to enter into new, untapped domestic markets
and may help supplant job losses in my district in other industries.
However, for many states eager to establish these pilot research
projects, aggressive federal overreach has impeded the efforts of
researchers and farmers. This week's amendment will help prevent
further abuse in the future and allow these important research efforts
to begin.

Casework Corner: Helping Victims of Identity Theft
Recently, a constituent from Lexington contacted my office as he was in
need of help in working with the IRS. While waiting to receive his tax
return after filing his taxes in February, he found out he was a victim
of identity theft and was told he would be forced to wait anywhere from
180 days to two years to receive the refund he was due. We were able to
help him secure his refund within two weeks.
If you are having trouble with a federal agency, please contact my
Lexington office at (859) 219-1366, as we may be able to provide
assistance!
Addressing the Disaster that is Obamacare
Thursday morning, I spoke on the floor of the US House about the need
to put politics aside and work together to help our neighbors who are
hurting by addressing the disaster that is Obamacare.
Obamacare has made life harder for most Kentucky families, driving up
costs, limiting choices of doctors and hospitals, and taking away
insurance coverage that people liked.
Kentucky families, workers and business owners want healthcare reform
that lowers costs, expands coverage and covers pre-existing conditions
without hurting quality or cutting jobs.
That is why I introduced the bipartisan Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act
with Dr. Ami Bera, a Democrat Congressman from California.
I have also cosponsored the American Health Care Reform Act, a
comprehensive alternative to Obamacare that would implement the common
sense, patient-centered reforms I've always supported.
The Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act and the American Health Care Reform
Act are better solutions than Obamacare, which until replaced, will
continue to destroy jobs, hurt medical innovation, take away choices
and drive up costs.

Ensuring Kentucky Veterans Receive the Care they Deserve
If you or a veteran you know is having problems with the VA, I want to
know about it.
I have been working with the Sixth District Veterans Coalition I
started last year to ensure that our veterans are receiving the care
they need and deserve in a timely fashion.
Last month, my office sent out a survey inquiring about the care and
service provided by the Lexington VA to Kentucky's veterans and service
members, including those who are in rural areas and travel to Lexington
for care.
Thank you to those who have already returned our survey, and I
encourage all members of our military community to fill the survey out
on my website or call my office with their input. If you know someone
who would like to fill out the survey, I hope you will encourage them
to fill it out as well.
Please click here to take the survey
. And thank you for your service to our
nation.

Dear

Today
the

working
this
week
in

visiting
with
folks
across
the
Sixth

Recently,
a
constituent
from
Lexington
contacted
my
office
as
he
was
in
need
of
help
in
working
with
the
IRS.
While
waiting
to
receive
his
tax
return
after

taxes
in

he
found
out
he
was
a
victim

was
told
he
would
be
forced
to
wait
anywhere
from
180
days
to
two
years
to
receive
the
refund
he
was
due.
We
were
able
to
help
him
secure
his
refund
within
two
weeks.

Addressing
the
Disaster
that
is
Obamacare
Thursday
morning,
I
spoke
on
the
floor
of
the
US
House
about
the
need
to
put
politics
aside
and
work
together
to
help
our
neighbors
who
are
hurting
by
addressing
the
disaster
that
is
Obamacare.
Obamacare
has
made
life
harder
for
most
Kentucky
families,
driving
up
costs,
limiting
choices
of
doctors
and
hospitals,
and
taking
away
insurance
coverage
that
people
liked.
Kentucky
families,
workers
and
business
owners
want
healthcare
reform
that
lowers
costs,
expands
coverage
and
covers
pre-existing
conditions
without
hurting
quality
or
cutting
jobs.
That
is
why
I
introduced
the
bipartisan
Saving
Lives,
Saving
Costs
Act
with
Dr.
Ami
Bera,
a
Democrat
Congressman
from
California.
I
have
also
cosponsored
the
American
Health
Care
Reform
Act,
a
comprehensive
alternative
to
Obamacare
that
would
implement
the
common
sense,
patient-centered
reforms
I&#8217;ve
always
supported.
The
Saving
Lives,
Saving
Costs
Act
and
the
American
Health
Care
Reform
Act
are
better
solutions
than
Obamacare,
which
until
replaced,
will
continue
to
destroy
jobs,
hurt
medical
innovation,
take
away
choices
and
drive
up
costs.

Ensuring
Kentucky
Veterans
Receive
the
Care
they
Deserve
If
you
or
a
veteran
you
know
is
having
problems
with
the
VA,
I
want
to
know
about
it.
I
have
been
working
with
the
Sixth
District
Veterans
Coalition
I
started
last
year
to
ensure
that
our
veterans
are
receiving
the
care
they
need
and
deserve
in
a
timely
fashion.
Last
month,
my
office
sent
out
a
survey
inquiring
about
the
care
and
service
provided
by
the
Lexington
VA
to
Kentucky&#8217;s
veterans
and
service
members,
including
those
who
are
in
rural
areas
and
travel
to
Lexington
for
care.
Thank
you
to
those
who
have
already
returned
our
survey,
and
I
encourage
all
members
of
our
military
community
to
fill
the
survey
out
on
my
website
or
call
my
office
with
their
input.
If
you
know
someone
who
would
like
to
fill
out
the
survey,
I
hope
you
will
encourage
them
to
fill
it
out
as
well.
