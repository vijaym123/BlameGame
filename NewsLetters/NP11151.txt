Farm Bill Gives Big Boost to Water and Land Conservation Efforts
President Obama Signs the 2014 Farm Bill at Michigan State
University
Senator Stabenow, Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry, spent time in both Grand Rapids and Frankenmuth
last week to discuss implementation of the 2014 Farm Bill's historic
investment in conservation of the Great Lakes and private lands.
Chairwoman Stabenow met with Michigan agriculture and conservation
leaders to get input and discuss what the next steps are as the U.S.
Department of Agriculture begins implementing the new law. The Farm Bill
includes a new regional partnership program that will protect our Great
Lakes and watersheds for future generations to enjoy. It will also open
up new areas for people to access private lands for hunting and fishing.
"The Farm Bill is the biggest investment our country makes in
conservation and includes a new regional partnership program that will
protect our Great Lakes for future generations. I will continue working
closely with Michigan farmers and conservation leaders, who are on the
front lines protecting our Great Lakes and natural resources, as we work
to put the Farm Bill's reforms into effect," Senator Stabenow told the
groups.

Milk Producers Honor Chairwoman Stabenow
Senator Stabenow received the "Champion of Dairy Award" from the
Michigan Milk Producers Association last week. This is only the second
time the group has given out the award. Senator Stabenow was honored
because of her work on behalf of Michigan's dairy farmers in the 2014
Farm Bill. Dairy is one of Michigan's top agriculture commodities, and
U.S. dairy exports have more than doubled in the last ten years. The
Farm Bill gives Michigan dairy farmers the tools they need to meet the
increasing global demand while at the same time assuring U.S. consumers
an abundant supply of milk.
