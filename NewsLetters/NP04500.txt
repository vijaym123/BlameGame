Thank our veterans and troops this season with Holiday Mail for Heroes
Dear Friend:
Please join me in sharing the spirit of the season by participating in the
Red Cross Holiday Mail for Heroes
program. Now in its eighth consecutive year, the program allows Americans to express their warm greetings of thanks and holiday cheer with members of our Armed Forces.
A personalized holiday greeting card is a simple but meaningful way to let our brave service members, veterans, and their families know how much we care. The holidays are an especially important time to let these men and women know that we are grateful for their service and appreciate the daily sacrifices that they and their loved ones make for all of us.
Beginning this year, the Holiday Mail for Heroes program takes on a different look as individual Red Cross chapters take complete control of the program, meaning there will no longer be a national P.O. Box to which cards are sent. Local Red Cross offices are collecting, sorting, and distributing the holiday greeting cards.
I strongly encourage area residents, schools, and community organizations to get involved in this important nationwide program.
I will be accepting cards at both of my constituent service offices from now until December 3rd.

The American Red Cross has kindly asked senders to keep in mind a few guidelines:
DO
* Include a heartfelt message and signature
* Use generic salutations such as Dear Service Member, Veteran, or Military Family Member
DO NOT
* Include personal contact information such as home or email ad-dresses
* Include inserts of any kind; these items will be removed during the reviewing process
* Send letters, packages, or gifts; only cards are accepted
* Use cards that contain glitter, which can aggravate existing health issues
Holiday Mail for Heroes participants can help spread the word through social media by using the hashtag: #holidaymail. For more information on the program, please visit:
