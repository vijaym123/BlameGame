Dear
Friends,
Christmas reminds us of the gift bestowed to us by God,
and because of that gift, we should celebrate by giving back to people
in need.
This holiday season is a time to count our blessings and
recognize the abilities we all possess to bring joy to someones
day.
Thats why at this time of year, I like to give back to
community and help those less fortunate. This holiday season I
volunteered at the Georgia Mountain Food Bank.
I was encouraged to see
what anyone can do in just a few hours to help the neighbors they may
not even know are in need this time of year.
I've been
blessed beyond my imagination to work for you, and as 2014 draws to a close
I'm spending time in gratitude not just for what we have, but for the
future each of us has the freedom to pursue with
hope.
Lisa, the kids, and I wish you and yours a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
