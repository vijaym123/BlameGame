Dear Friends:
It has been a busy week since Congress
returned from its recess period. From the
growing threat of ISIS and the somber reflections
on the Anniversary of 9/11, to the recent attacks
on free speech and the Democrats attempts
to play politics with corporate tax policy
these were just a few of the many issues
that have become the subject of discussion and
debate. I have addressed these and other
challenges our nation is facing and wanted to
share my thoughts and comments with you to keep
you updated on my work in Congress and the
challenges we face.
It is an honor to serve you. I always
appreciate your feedback, ideas and
concerns. Please feel free to contact me by

Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
