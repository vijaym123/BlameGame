Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Gone But Not Forgotten
This past week, I had the honor of recognizing two heroes no longer
with us. On Tuesday at the Edgar County Sheriff's Office in Paris,
above, I presented to Sheriff Ed Motley a flag I had flown over the
U.S. Capitol on behalf of Deputy John Landrum, who was killed in the
line of duty 25 years ago.
At right, in Norris City on Monday, I showed the military decorations
earned by the late Korean War Navy veteran Robert Spence that my office
was able to obtain for his widow, Rose.
Environmental Protection Agency Cap-And-Trade Rule All Pain, No Gain
On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled new carbon
emissions regulations that amount to a cap-and-trade system, after
failing to win support in Congress for such a program. Without a doubt,
this new front in the War on Coal will raise electricity rates -
especially in the Midwest - and cost hundreds of thousands of
good-paying jobs nationwide.
All for what though? EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy already conceded
that it's "unlikely" any of her agency's climate-related rules will
have a meaningful impact on EPA's own indicators of global climate
change. In fact, even if President Obama could close every coal-fired
power plant in America tomorrow, the effect on global emissions would
be entirely offset by just a fraction of the proposed coal-fired plants
being built overseas.
This rule will be all pain and no gain for American energy consumers
and job seekers.
House Members Seek GAO Report On Internet Oversight Transition
I joined a group of Republican House members Thursday in writing the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to request an examination of the
Obama Administration's recent proposal for the United States to give up
its traditional Internet oversight role.
In March, the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA), an agency of the Department of Commerce,
announced its intention to transition oversight of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) root functions to a global
multi-stakeholder community.
In the letter,
we express concern that the criteria for
transition set forth by NTIA may not ensure that the Internet remains
free and open in the absence of U.S. oversight. This move follows House
passage last month of the National Defense Authorization Act, which
included an amendment I offered requiring such a GAO study.
Announcements

produced agricultural products, and to develop new market opportunities
for farm and ranch operations serving local markets. Go to
www.ams.usda.gov/FMPP for more information.
Fire Grant Awarded: Pocahontas Old Ripley Fire Protection District has
been selected as a recipient of a Fiscal Year 2013 Assistance to
Firefighters Grant.

and Safety grants can fund professional training, wellness and fitness
programs and equipment, personal protective equipment, modifications to
facilities, and supplies that support firefighting and non-hospital
affiliated Emergency Medical Services operations and safety.

Gone
But
Not
Forgotten This
past
week,
I
had
the
honor of
recognizing
two
heroes
no
longer
with
us.
On
Tuesday
at
the
Edgar
County
Sheriff's
Office
in
Paris,
above,
I presented
to Sheriff
Ed
Motley
a
flag
I
had
flown
over
the
U.S.
Capitol
on
behalf
of
Deputy
John
Landrum,
who
was
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
25
years
ago.
At
right,
in
Norris
City
on
Monday,
I showed
the
military
decorations earned
by
the
late
Korean
War
Navy
veteran
Robert
Spence
that
my
office
was
able
to
obtain
for
his
widow,
Rose.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
Cap-And-Trade
Rule All
Pain,
No
Gain
On
Monday,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
unveiled
new
carbon
emissions
regulations
that
amount
to
a
cap-and-trade
system,
after
failing
to
win
support
in
Congress
for
such
a program.
Without
a
doubt,
this
new
front
in
the
War
on
Coal
will
raise
electricity
rates
&#8211;
especially
in
the
Midwest
&#8211;
and
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
good-paying
jobs
nationwide.
All
for
what
though?
EPA
Administrator
Gina
McCarthy

any
of
her
agency's
climate-related
rules
will
have
a
meaningful
impact
on
EPA's
own
indicators
of
global
climate
change.
In
fact,
even
if
President
Obama
could
close
every
coal-fired
power
plant
in
America
tomorrow,
the
effect
on
global
emissions
would
be
entirely
offset
by
just
a
fraction
of
the
proposed
coal-fired
plants
being
built
overseas.
This
rule
will
be
all
pain
and
no
gain
for
American
energy
consumers
and
job
seekers.
