David --
Since Cheri told you that Tea Party members of the House were blocking an extension of long-term unemployment benefits, over 3,000 of you have stepped up to tell them to knock it off. Thank you so much -- this marks amazing progress! But every moment that they get away with this means another one of our neighbors suffers.
We have to fight back against this -- and the only way to do that is to make Speaker Boehner hear us loud and clear: we demand an extension of long-term unemployment benefits! Will you add your name to join us? 3,500 Strong:
Use this link to sign your name and demand Speaker Boehner bring an extension of long-term unemployment benefits to the House floor immediately &gt;&gt;
We&rsquo;ve got to keep fighting until we get the results that Illinois deserves.
Thank you!
