District
Dear Friends,
A year ago, Lancey Robbins visited the U.S.
Capitol and marveled at the quality of student art lining the underground
tunnels. She imagined her work hanging on the same walls, representing
Idahos 1 st
District in the annual Congressional Art
Competition.
Robbins will soon see her dream realized. Her work,
Oasis in the Owyhees, won this years contest. In June, she and her
parents, Jeff and Dawnell, will attend the annual awards
ceremony.
Its pretty awesome, said Robbins, 16, a sophomore at Another
Choice Charter School in Nampa.
Robbins is pretty awesome
herself.
She credits two art teachers for her success, Courtney
Linker at Another Choice Charter and Crystal Myers of the Melba School
District.
Linker, who urged Robbins to enter the Congressional
Competition, calls her a model student and hard worker. Myers says shes
not afraid to push the limits of her ability. I wish all my students
were as courageous in their art as Lancey, Myers said.
The
painting that will hang for the next year in the Capitol depicts Squaw
Creek, near Marsing. Robbins chose the image after a friend showed
her photos from a desert hike. It instantly clicked, Robbins said. I
told myself, I have to paint that.
Amazingly enough, the
winning entry was Robbins first work in oil. As a youngster, she used
colored pencils and markers, often choosing horses and pets as
subjects, including a cocker spaniel named Mayla and a cat named
Gismo.
She also worked with acrylics, but found them runny. So when Myers
offered to loan her oil paints, she jumped at the
chance.
With oils, you can flick your brush up and get these neat little
ridges, Robbins said. With the waterfall I used thick, thick paint and was
able to get that beautiful texture where it looks like the water was
actually foaming and running.
She also loves the way oils
combine. They perfectly blend together, running from light to dark. You
get those nice, popping colors.
Robbins plans to seek an
art degree in college and thinks working for Walt Disney Imagineering
would be a great job. When she and her folks are in Washington, they
plan to visit the Smithsonians National Gallery of Art. Robbins is
especially keen on seeing the Van Goghs.
The Congressional Art
Competition began in 1982 and more than 650,000 high school students have
participated. The other 1 st
District winners this year
were 2 nd
place finisher Sarah Darby of Mountain View High in
Meridian; 3 rd
place Riley Helal of Coeur dAlene High; and
Heidi Patin, also of Coeur dAlene High, who was the choice of voters
on my Facebook page. To see all the entries,
