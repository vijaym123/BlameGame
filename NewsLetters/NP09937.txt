It has been a busy
month in Washington and at home. Here is a look at what I have been
working on, what is coming in the weeks ahead, and updates on pertinent
issues in the 2nd
Congressional
District.
What I
have been up to
Introduced the
Protecting Educational Loans
for Underserved Students Act (PLUS Act)
with members of the
Congressional Black Caucus
The PLUS Act would restore
reasonable criteria for determining whether a parent seeking funds for
their child to go to college has an adverse credit history, and
includes new provisions for loan counseling to ensure borrowers who receive
disbursements have a full understanding of the terms and conditions of
the loans and their repayment
obligations.
Spoke at the Louisiana Legislature
on
Medicaid Expansion
On April 23, 2014
I discussed the benefits of Medicaid Expansion during a visit to a
Health and Welfare committee hearing. I spoke about the large scale job
creation that would result from
Medicaid
expansion in Louisiana
and the thousands of residents it would
benefit. To watch a video of the hearing click

What
to look forward to
A set of bills on
Criminal Justice
Reform
that would reduce prison time for inmates that make
positive life choices and would address the costly practice of solitary
confinement.
In an important step to reduce sentencing
disparities for drug offenders in the federal prison system, Attorney General
Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department will soon detail
new, more expansive criteria that the department will use in considering
when to recommend clemency applications for President Obamas review.
In addition to this positive step, I am preparing legislation
that would provide strong incentives for inmates to pursue skills
training while incarcerated in return for reduced time. I will also be
providing leadership in the area of solitary confinement reforms, by
introducing a bill which would have the federal government partner with
local law enforcement to address the unconstitutional practices that
currently plague the solitary confinement practice. These reforms will
save taxpayer money and promote more humane treatment of
inmates.
What is impacting
the 2nd Congressional
District
The
National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP)
recently
issued
a bulletin to its private sector, Write Your Own
insurance company partners to provide updated information pertaining to the
implementation of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of
2014 (HFIAA).

With
Hurricane season
just around the corner I encourage you to
visit
Ready.gov
to find some easy steps to prepare.
Remember to always know your risks, take action to make sure you and
your family are prepared for severe weather, and be an example by
telling family, friends, and co-workers to do the same.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd
Congressional District of Louisiana
Unemployment Insurance
Renewal More than 1.3 million** Americans are
reeling from the loss of the emergency unemployment insurance they rely
on to support themselves and their families. I want to hear how this is
impacting you.
How have you been impacted by the loss of emergency unemployment
insurance?
I am
experiencing hardship. A family member is experiencing hardship. A friend is experiencing
hardship. I have not been
impacted. If you have been impacted by the loss of unemployment insurance how
would restoring it help?
