Addressing the
Measles Outbreak
Many of you have heard of the recent
measles outbreak. There have been cases in communities across the nation,
including Palatine. We must do everything we can to stop these
outbreaks before they spread further and endanger even more
people.
The science is clear. Vaccinations work. Vaccinations are
safe. Vaccinations do not cause autism.
In fact, even the
leading autism group,
Autism Speaks, agrees that science
proves vaccines do not cause autism and is urging parents to vaccinate
their children.
Yet, measles is one of the most contagious
diseases, far more than Ebola, though not as deadly, it can have very serious
effects including death. The vaccine is effective for 99 percent of
those who get both doses.
Given those realities, we should
vaccinate our children. I did. State law requires that all children in
public schools comply with an immunization schedule, which includes the
measles vaccine. Statistics show that 98 percent of Illinois school
children had their immunizations in the 2013-2014 school year. But even
with these high vaccination rates, each child who needlessly goes
unvaccinated puts other children at risk.
There are children, who
for certain medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated. Babies under 1
year, like those in the Palatine measles cluster, rely on the rest of us
to be properly vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases. We must
make sure all those who can get vaccinated do, to protect their
health and the health of the most vulnerable.
If your child has
not been vaccinated for measles, I encourage you to vaccinate your child
today.
Under Obamacare, almost all private health plans must
provide the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine for free.
Medicaid
also provides coverage for this service.
If you have additional
questions about vaccines and how to get them in your area, please call
the Illinois Department of Public Health Immunization Program at
217-785-1455 or 800-526-4372.
Please join me for the below Orientation on
Immigration Executive Actions
Feb. 15 is the Deadline.
