Blaine's Bulletin
With the end of the year nearing, I was recently reflecting over the past two years in Congress. While there were many battles placed in front of Congress, there were also several highlights that come to mind over the past couple of years.
One particular occasion was the Night of Superstars Event that was held in Festus at the beginning of this year. The charity event recognized extraordinary children who are affected by varying types of disabling conditions but reach far beyond their adversities by exceling in activities such as academics, athletics, and community service. I was incredibly humbled to accompany Sarah Weston down the red carpet and into the awards ceremony for the evening. That evening was such a unique experience and I often think of Sarah and the 19 other superstars I met that night.
In addition, I have met several of the most inspiring young adults as a member of the Military Academy for the 3 rd
District. Each year, I look forward to meeting with the members of the nominating board that helps to decide which young people should earn nominations for our four armed service academies. Just this month the board convened and we had another crop of extremely bright young people and since Ive been doing this the level of candidates grows even more impressive. Each year, I always look forward to meeting these young people face-to-face and seeing what great things they will accomplish.
Meeting folks in the 3 rd
District and attending events for truly wonderful people is one of my favorite aspects of being in Congress. However, legislation that I introduce and my work on the House Financial Services and Small Business Committees are also incredibly important to me, just in a different capacity.
This past year, I have been championing an effort in Congress to end a program called Operation Choke Point. Briefly, the name refers to an organized attempt by the Department of Justice and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), to bully and intimidate financial institutions from offering financial services to certain licensed, legally-operating industries the government doesnt like in an attempt to choke off those industries from our countrys banking system. I have introduced multiple pieces of legislation to end this program and, most recently, the FDIC Chairman was in my office and I have demanded progress by the agency in ending this unprecedented program. I will continue to remain vigilant in putting an end to this issue in 2015.
Lastly, I am very excited and humbled to announce my new role as the Chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance. I look forward to working on housing and insurance issues that face our nation in the 114 th
Congress.
So, while we are starting to look to the new year, I wanted to take the opportunity to touch on a few highlights from 2014. Serving the more than 750,000 folks in the 3 rd
District is an honor and I look forward to hearing from you as we work together to improve the lives of all Americans.
