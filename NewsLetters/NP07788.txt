Dear Neighbor,
Sometimes its difficult to understand how to approach many of the federal issues you may be experiencing. That is why I'd like to personally invite you to an Open House we are hosting at my Kendall office next Monday, July 21st from 4:00 - 6:00 PM.
We are located at 12851 SW 42nd Street, Suite 131, Miami, Florida 33175.
Stop by and say hello or come have your questions answered by representatives from various federal agencies including -
- U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)
- Social Security
- Veteran's Administration
- IRS.
Please join us for an informative afternoon and come learn more about the services our offices provide.
I hope to see you there and please don't hesitate to invite your friends and family.
Sincerely,
Joe Garcia, U.S. House Representative (FL-26)
