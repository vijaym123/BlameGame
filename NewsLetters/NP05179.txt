Friend -- I ALMOST didn&rsquo;t send this email. This is NOT easy to say:
There are 11 days until Election Day -- and 11 Senate races that are too close to call. But we&rsquo;re falling behind in fundraising, and that means we could lose.
Our senior leadership is asking:
Can we fund all 11 of these tied races? Will we have to cut states loose?
It&rsquo;s especially terrifying because the GOP needs to win just six races to take the Senate.
As the DSCC&rsquo;s Political Director, I can guarantee: the Senate is absolutely winnable. We&rsquo;re tied in McConnell&rsquo;s race and even across the South! But we NEED 2,132 contributions by midnight to fill our funding hole.
Will you pitch in to protect our Democratic Senate majority? All gifts will be matched until midnight, doubling your impact.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
The
Washington Post
spelled out our problem: &ldquo;Money is finite, and that means making decisions about how it should be spent is of critical importance in the waning days.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m not exaggerating: If you
help us raise the cash we need , Mitch McConnell will be gone and the Senate will be ours in 11 days. Let&rsquo;s get this done.
Thanks,
Anne
