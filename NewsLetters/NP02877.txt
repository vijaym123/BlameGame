Sending the Keystone Pipeline to
President Obama's Desk
2/11/15
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn cast a vote in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline, finally
sending the bill to President Obama's desk for his
signature.
"The President has wasted six
long years and lost a golden opportunity to create economic growth
and to provide greater energy security by delaying the approval of the
Keystone XL Pipeline. It is time for President Obama to finally work
with the bipartisan majorities in Congress who have supported this
project. The Keystone XL Pipeline will support long-term energy security
and will support more than 42,000 jobs across the country. This equals
$2 billion in earnings for workers and contributes approximately $3.4
billion to the U.S. gross domestic product. The Keystone pipeline has
met all the requirements this administration has demanded and more.
There is simply no fact-based reason for the President to oppose this
project. I hope that he stands with a majority of Americans who believe
that it is well past time to build the Keystone XL
Pipeline.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
