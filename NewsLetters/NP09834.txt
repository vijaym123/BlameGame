Tax Freedom Day
Finally Arrives in New Jersey
The people of New Jersey
are taxed too much.
Nothing proves that more convincingly than
the arrival of Tax Freedom Day on May 9 th
the day average
New Jerseyans have finally earned enough to pay their entire tax
bill.
Starting today, people can put the money they earn in their own
pockets to support themselves and their families instead of
supporting government.
This year, New Jersey is the last state in
the country to reach Tax Freedom Day, which means the people of our
state work longer than anyone else in America to cover the money
government takes from their paychecks.
According to the Tax
Foundation, Americans will pay more in taxes this year than on food,
clothing, and housing combined.
It is outrageous that our people
have to work harder to support the government than they do to provide
the basic necessities for their families.
This is
unacceptable.
That is why I am a strong supporter of lowering taxes at the
federal level and support similar efforts at the state, county, and
local levels.
We must lift the burden of high taxes from the backs
of the people of New Jersey.
High Unemployment
Among Young People Denies Them The American
Dream
With commencement season upon us, graduates are having a very hard time
finding jobs.
Eighteen to 29 years olds are more than twice as
likely as the general working population to be
unemployed .
Our economy continues to be mired in the worst recovery
since World War II.
Until we stop piling more taxes and
regulations onto the nations job creators, we are unlikely to see
opportunities open up.
Another Unintended Consequence:
Obamacares Killer Burden on Nurses
A California nurse
writes
in
Time
about the burden Obamacare is already taking on nurses and other
health care professionals.
This is yet another example of the law of
unintended consequences that seem to be the hallmark of the deeply
flawed Affordable Care Act.
The nurse writes: While I
hope the ACA will get care to millions of other Americans, I worry
that it may make it harder for people to get comprehensive, timely care
from trained and compassionate health care practitioners, including
nurses like me.
Thats the last thing we need: making it
harder for some of the hardest working people I know
nurses
to do
their jobs.
Advisor: White House Brought Benghazi Probe
on Itself
The House this week voted to formally
establish a select committee to investigate Benghazi.
Although
the vote was mostly along party lines, a handful of Democrats did join
with the Majority in strong support of this measure.
The
White House and the Presidents supporters are trying to paint this
investigation as a partisan exercise, but longtime Democratic advisor
Kirsten Powers isnt buying that argument.
In this powerful
op-ed , she explains why she believes the White Houses
efforts to divert attention from this scandal have, in fact, succeeded
in keeping it alive.
A Presidential Speech We Will
Never Hear, But Should
William Galston
drafts
the speech he wishes that the President would deliver
on Ukraine.
Unfortunately, it doesnt look as if the President
understands the nature of the threat to peace and freedom across
Eastern Europe posed by Russian adventurism in Ukraine, so I dont expect
to hear anything such as this coming from the Oval Office anytime
soon.
Learning from Our Foreign Policy
Mistakes
Speaker John Boehner
spells
out
exactly why we need a bilateral security agreement with the Afghan
government (and why failing to arrive at one with Iraq has eroded the gains
we made there).
The progress that Afghanistan and the United
States and our other allies have made in this strategically important
country must be preserved for both our own security and for the people of
Afghanistan.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) Arrives In U.S.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) has recently reached the United States for the
first time .
This disease is primarily found in the Middle
East (as the name suggests), but with our highly mobile society, its
possible for it to be carried around the world, much as SARS was
several years ago.
The Centers for Disease Control has
some valuable
information
on its web site about
the virus and how its spread.
