Dear Friend,
On January 30th, I made the decision to retire at the end of my term
after 40 years in Congress. It has been a great honor to serve the
people of Los Angeles in the House of Representatives for all these
years. It was a difficult decision, but I leave proud of my record of
service and with the conviction that, even in this polarized
environment, Congress can be a force for good.
I hope you'll take a moment to read more about my years of work on
behalf of the people of Southern California.
