Witnesses from four federal agencies testified on H.R. 4296 , which would extend the current immigration transition through 2019. During the transition there is a special CW category of foreign worker for the Northern Mariana Islands and an annual employer fee, $1.3 million last year, that goes to training U.S. workers. Each year of the transition the number of CWs allowed would have to be reduced until reaching zero in 2019. Testifying on the bill and H.R. 4402 were Megan Uzzell, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Labor Department; David Gulick, District Director for Hawai'i, Guam, and the Northern Marianas at the Department of Homeland Security; Tom Bussanich, Director of Budget for the Office of Insular Affairs at the Interior Department; James Kurth, Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System at Interior; Joe Ludovici, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy; and Major General Fred Padilla, U.S. Marines.
Subcommittee takes testimony on 5-year transition extension - Chairman John Fleming (R-Louisiana) started this week's hearing on H.R. 4296 , my bill to extend the current immigration transition period, by explaining "... it is unlikely to go from 10,000 [foreign workers] to zero this year without it adversely affecting its economy." Governor Eloy Inos submitted testimony making the same point: "The unavoidable truth is that the Northern Mariana Islands needs more time to train and prepare its local citizenry to phase out its dependency on foreign workers..." The number of foreign workers has already gone from about 22,000 in the last year the Commonwealth ran the immigration system to 10,071 under federal control. And even if the transition period is extended the number of workers allowed still has to go down every year. Another important reason to keep the transition period is the training fees it generates. $1.3 million went to the Public School System, Northern Marianas College, and the Northern Marianas Training Institute last year alone to train local workers for jobs in our economy. If the transition ends this year, those training funds disappear. Video of the entire hearing wmedia resources/113/2014_04_29_fwoia.wvx> is available at the Natural Resources Committee website .

I had the opportunity to thank the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, (above) for the hard work of his staff serving the Northern Mariana Islands at this week's meeting of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. USCIS, CBP, TSA, ICE, FEMA, and the U.S. Coast Guard are all present in our islands. The Caucus was also able to put forth our recommendations on humane enforcement of our nation's immigrations laws , Johnson's primary responsibility. "Family unity is our top immigration priority," Caucus Chair Judy Chu (D-California) told the Secretary.
Rota and Tinian begin food stamp increase - Food stamp recipients on Rota and Tinian began receiving higher benefits on May 1. For a family of four on Rota the maximum monthly allotment went from $444 to $719, a 62 percent jump. The same family on Tinian now gets a maximum of $568, a 28 percent increase. Residents of the Northern Islands also got a 62 percent increase. I have been working to lift benefits throughout my time in Congress, but the local government has resisted the change, even returning over $4 million in unused benefit monies at one point. But over the last year the Commonwealth has worked cooperatively with the Agriculture Department, providing data on prices and other information that allowed for a decision in March to raise benefits. Families on Saipan are also in need of more assistance and Agriculture is in the process of calculating how much that can be. The Department decided it would be unfair to people on Rota and Tinian to delay their increase, however, while waiting for the Saipan data to be evaluated. For the complete schedule of new benefits go to sablan.house.gov .
CNMI food stamp technology upgrade will complement SNAP study - The Northern Marianas government has issued a request for proposals to upgrade computer systems and software used for managing its food stamp program . The CNMI is using funds carried over from the food stamps grant of $12.148 million that Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2013. Upgrading the system will help bring the Northern Marianas food stamp program into line with SNAP, the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and add the ability to issue benefits using plastic debit cards. The recently enacted Agricultural Act of 2014 requires the Department of Agriculture to study the capability of the Northern Marianas to operate SNAP and provides $30.5 million to raise benefits beginning in October 2015. The CNMI's proposed system upgrade and moving away from paper food stamps should make SNAP for the Marianas that much more doable. Agriculture is working on drafting the request for proposals for its SNAP study. That request is expected to be issued this summer.
Report goal: Better benefits for island vets - Language I requested, requiring a review and report on how we are getting benefits to veterans living in the Northern Mariana Islands and other rural areas of our country, cleared the House this week. There is a general understanding that vets outside urban areas have a harder time getting the benefits they are entitled to. The FY 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, H.R. 4486
passed 416-1 and its accompanying report includes my language. The Veterans Benefits Administration will have to send Congress an assessment of the agency's current effectiveness in reaching rural veterans and detail the costs and resources needed to ensure that rural veterans have full access to all services. With that information we will be better able to increase funding or make other changes that get rural veterans everything they deserve.

Dora B. Miura and Beth S. Miura visited the congressional office this week. They were accompanying 2014 Teacher of the Year, Paul Miura, Dora's husband and Beth's son, who joined other teachers of the year from around the nation being honored in Washington. Mr. Miura teaches at Saipan Southern High School. Congratulations, Paul, for a remarkable achievement. And thank you, Dora and Beth, for stopping by.
2012 economic data released, NMI adjusting to loss of garment industry - 1,339 business establishments employed 14,215 people, paid $208.4 million in annual payroll, and generated $1.3 billion in sales. These are some of the results announced this week in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 Economic Census for the Northern Mariana Islands . The economic census is required by law every five years and is the U.S. Government's official measure of American business in every state and territory. Looking at the change from 2007 the census shows significant declines - sales off by 7.3 percent, employees down 39.5 percent, payroll reduced 21.5 percent - largely due to the closure of the garment industry. There were still a dozen companies manufacturing garments in 2007, all now gone. Employment increases were seen, however, in the health care and social assistance sector. The economic census data is available at the Census Bureau's American FactFinder .

Who fought the Hittite King Muwatallis in what was, perhaps, the greatest chariot battle of all time? Grace Christian Academy sophomore Josiah Trinidad has the answer; and that knowledge of history is what brought him to represent the Northern Mariana Islands at this week's National History Bee and Bowl in Washington. This is the first year the NMI is competing in the international event. But Josiah placed 35th in a field of 83 teams, which is especially remarkable since most teams have four to six members and Josiah was a team of one. Josiah was accompanied by GCA teacher Alvin Owens. Congratulations and thanks for stopping by your congressional office. [For the answer see bottom of e-kilili.]
U.S. Pacific Islands deep-sea coral research is set to begin in 2015 - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be conducting deep-sea coral research in the U.S. Pacific Islands including the Northern Mariana Islands in 2015-2017. Although specific research locations and overall research plans for the Pacific Islands are still being developed, NOAA is consulting the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, other federal agencies, and stakeholders to identify research priorities. Little is known about deep-sea corals in the Mariana Islands, which represents one of the knowledge gaps in the region. In 2009, NOAA launched the Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program , called for in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Program is the nation's only federal research program dedicated to increasing scientific understanding of deep-sea coral ecosystems and is designed to provide ocean resource managers with scientific studies needed to inform conservation actions. NOAA released its 2014 Report to Congress , which highlights the discovery of deep-sea coral habitats as well as progress made in their regional research.
