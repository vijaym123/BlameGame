David -- We have a MAJOR problem. And only a few hours left to find a solution. Take 30 seconds to read this:
The final federal fundraising deadline of the election was last night. We were able to hit our initial goal -- but then the Koch Brothers ambushed us with $1.8 million worth of attacks in races Democrats must win.
We repeat: these are seats we HAVE to win.
And now we don&rsquo;t have the cash to compete with the Kochs.
So we don&rsquo;t have any other option: we&rsquo;re making an
emergency extension
of the triple-match
TODAY ONLY .
This is our last chance to salvage our hopes in this election. Please. Please, David. Can you chip in right now?
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION** TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
David -- we can&rsquo;t leave our Democratic candidates out in the cold. So -- TODAY ONLY -- we are making an
emergency extension
of the triple-match. If you&rsquo;re planning to chip in to fight the Republican attacks, please chip in right now.
