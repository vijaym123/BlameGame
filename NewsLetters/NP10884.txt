Eastern North Carolina Update with Congressman Walter B. Jones
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Over the past month, I have been working hard on the
issues that are of great importance to the Third District.
I want to
provide you with information on just a few of the ways I am working to
assist my fellow Eastern North Carolinians.
On Thursday, March 27th, I spoke at a press conference in support of
the Help Hire Our Heroes Act
(H.R.
4149), legislation I've cosponsored to provide vocational training for
veterans in need. The men and women who serve in our armed forces are
hard-working, capable individuals with bright futures, and this
legislation will assist them in finding a job in which they will excel.
Defending Eastern North Carolina Values
*	On April 3rd, I was honored to be recognized by the American
Conservative Union as an "ACU Conservative
" for my
work to defend constitutionally limited government, individual liberty,
free markets, and a strong national defense.
*	My leadership in protecting the Judeo-Christian values
upon which our nation was founded is drawing
fire from a leading national atheist organization.
Protecting Taxpayer Money
*	Over the past few weeks, I voted multiple times
against bills that sent hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars
to foreign aid for Ukraine.
We must put a stop to this reckless cycle
of borrowing and spending money we do not have.
*	Last month, I called on House leaders
to prohibit members of
Congress from using taxpayer money to buy first class airline tickets
for themselves.
This is unacceptable, especially when our national
debt is over $17 trillion.
Fighting Obamacare
*	As a result of Obamacare, many Eastern North Carolina families
are seeing their premiums skyrocket and their insurance plans canceled.
I will continue to do everything I can to fight this unconstitutional
takeover
of
our healthcare system.
*	On March 25th, the Supreme Court heard a case challenging the
Obamacare mandate requiring businesses to provide health insurance that
covers things like abortion-inducing drugs and devices - even if those
things violate the business owner's religious beliefs.
I filed a brief
calling on the Court to rule that this
violates the Constitution and subsequent statutes which protect our
religious freedom.
Reining in Executive Overreach
*	A new document
revealed
that, because of an Obama administration policy, last year 68,000
illegal immigrants with criminal convictions were released instead of
deported. That is an outrage! The president must defend the safety and
economic security of the American people - and that means enforcing our
immigration laws.
*	On March 12th, I voted for a bill
to
require the president to enforce all laws, not just the ones that fit
his political agenda.
President Obama - and all future presidents -
should not be allowed to cherry-pick which laws they want to enforce.
Working for North Carolina's Coast
*	I am leading the effort
to block the Obama administration's proposal to close the NOAA marine
lab in Beaufort, North Carolina. The lab is a key provider of
scientific research on fisheries and marine issues affecting the entire
East Coast, and it is a critical part of the local economy.
*	I am proud to have helped secure the relocation
of the original Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
foundation stones, which will be moved inland to prevent them from
being damaged or lost. These stones are an important piece of Eastern
North Carolina's heritage and should be preserved for future
generations.

WASHINGTON,

-
Over
