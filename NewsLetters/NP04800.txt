Friend -
I share in the frustration of many Americans who are concerned about the direction the country is headed. They are tired of scandals, tired of excuses, and tired of seeing their country slipping through their fingers.
For me, I will continue to get up every day and fight for the principles upon which this nation was founded.
I will continue working to cut spending and reduce the debt, create an environment with reduced regulations and lower taxes where businesses can grow and create jobs, protect our national security, protect religious freedom for all Americans, ensure oversight of the executive branch, uphold the rule of law, and protect and preserve the rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
I believe we have a nation worth fighting for, and I will continue to work to ensure that we are putting forward policies that are in the best interest of the American people and our nation.
Yours in service,
Randy
