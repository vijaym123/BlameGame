Dear Friends,
Over the past couple of weeks I've had the wonderful pleasure of catching up with so many
constituents throughout Western Pennsylvania! I consider each of you
my neighbor
and, most importantly,
my boss , and appreciate nothing more than driving to different parts of our district to hear what's on your mind. Being home truly reminds me how very privileged and
honored I am to represent you in our nation's capital.
Within this newsletter you'll find some terrific snapshots from several of my visits around the Third District, and there will be plenty more to come in the weeks that follow. Remember: No matter what time of year it may be, I wholeheartedly encourage you to share with me your thoughts, concerns, and questions about the issues facing our district and our country whenever you wish. That includes receiving help with any federal agency. There are numerous ways to do this, including e-mail, regular mail, Facebook, Twitter, and direct calls to my offices in both Pennsylvania and Washington. More information about each of these resources can be found on the left-side panel and at
Kelly.house.gov .
I hope to see you on the road!
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Discusses
President Obama's War on Coal on Fox's
Huckabee
WATCH HERE
Two weekends ago, Rep. Kelly appeared on
Huckabee
on Fox News Channel to discuss his
Coal Country Protection Act
in response to the Obama administration's harmful anti-coal agenda with host Governor Mike Huckabee. Rep. Kelly also talked about his
invitation to President Obama
to visit a Western Pennsylvania coal mine in order to see firsthand some of the hundreds of thousands of jobs that could be lost if the EPA's new rule proposal is enacted.
Guest Op-Ed by Rep. Kelly
on EPA's Threat to US Economy Appears in
Wall Street Journal
On Monday, August 4th,
The Wall Street Journal
published
a guest op-ed
written by Rep. Kelly on the economic danger of the EPA's coal regulations under President Obama. Excerpts from " Pushing Back Against Obama's War on Coal " by Rep. Kelly:
"It was good to see coal finally get
a public hearing [last week]. The bad news is that President Obama and
the EPA have already issued their guilty verdict and handed down the
sentence."
"Coal generates 40% of America's electricity-more
than any other energy source. Its stable price and abundance insulates
the U.S. economy from spikes in energy demand. Yet the EPA is proposing
to destroy coal's benefits by imposing onerous emissions standards on
all existing power plants, under the threat of crippling fines, which is
certain to lead to plant closures."
"The EPA's war on coal has
troubling economic implications for every American and U.S. business.
As the new regulations take effect, Americans could see their electric
bills increase annually by more than 10%-$150 for the average
consumer-by the end of the decade, according to the American Action
Forum."
"By keeping energy rates reliably low, coal helps give
U.S. manufacturing its global edge against foreign competitors. On June 2
the National Association of Manufacturers warned that the EPA rule
'could single-handedly eliminate this competitive advantage by removing
reliable and abundant sources of energy from our nation's energy mix.'"
"Coal also provides, directly and indirectly, hundreds of thousands of
jobs across the country. In my state of Pennsylvania, more than 40,000
jobs are tied to coal production, including thousands of manufacturing
jobs in factories powered by coal. Federal regulations have already
forced two plants in my district to close over the past two years. The
National Mining Association estimates that more than 300 plants will
retire nationwide due to EPA rules over the next six years. When mines
and plants shut down, manufacturing costs rise and employment plummets."
"What is the point of all this pain? China and India, not the United
States, are the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide from coal. China
alone has increased coal production by more than 24% since 2005,
according to the Energy Information Administration, while the U.S. power
sector's carbon emissions have declined by 15%. According to the
National Mining Association, a coal plant built today emits 90% fewer
emissions than a plant built in the 1970s. That's not clean enough for
the EPA."
"The New Republic puts it this way: 'The goal of
these regulations is not to stop global warming, but to prove to the
international community that the U.S. is ready to pay additional costs
to combat climate change.' In other words, the Obama administration
expects the American people to sacrifice for the sake of mere
symbolism."
"I recently introduced the Coal Country Protection
Act (H.R. 4808) in the House of Representatives, a companion to Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell's legislation in the Senate. This bipartisan
bill-co-sponsored by West Virginia Democrat Nick Rahall, among
others-would halt new EPA regulation on power plants until there is a
guarantee that there will be no loss of American jobs, no drop in gross
domestic product, no higher electricity rates and no interruption in
energy delivery."
"In January 2008 as a presidential candidate,
Mr. Obama promised that 'electricity rates would necessarily
sky-rocket' under his policies and boasted that 'if somebody wants to
build a coal plant, they can-it's just that [it] will bankrupt them.' He
has shown as president that he intends to make good on that promise by
eradicating coal from American life."
"He used his first-year
political capital to try to pass a cap-and-trade plan, but that
legislation failed even in the Democratic Senate. Now he is leading the
charge again through regulatory fiat. The Clean Power Plan must be
stopped-not just for coal country, but the whole country."
Rep. Kelly Co-Authors
Bipartisan Letter to US Commerce & Agriculture Secretaries to Protect American Manufacturing Jobs
Last week, Rep. Kelly co-authored and submitted
a bipartisan letter
-- co-signed by 62 other representatives -- to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in opposition to a possible suspension agreement with Mexico in the antidumping and countervailing duty cases on Mexican sugar imports filed by U.S. sugar producers. The letter explains, as summarized by the Coalition for Sugar Reform, that " [a]ny managed trade agreement between the United States and Mexico that restricts access to sugar from Mexico, such as a suspension agreement, would hurt American consumers and businesses while putting the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship -- one that is important to a broad range of industries -- at risk ."
The full letter can be read
