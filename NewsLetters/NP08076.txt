Helping Constituents in the 7th District: 2014 Mid-Year Report
Each and every day we help the hardworking individuals and families of Colorado's 7th Congressional District cut through red tape and work with federal agencies. In the first six months of 2014, my team helped constituents receive more than $2,640,058 in savings and unpaid compensation from federal agencies. Together, they completed 281 cases for the hardworking folks in our district.
I'm proud of the work we do and the many constituents we assist.
For example, my team helped a
WWII veteran receive a POW medal
nearly 70 years after he was freed from Nazi forces. They helped track down lost tax returns, find missing retirement pay, and helped nominate the next generation of officers to our armed forces.
Do you need help with a federal agency?
My staff and I are here to help you . Whether you lost important documents, have not received a timely response from the federal government, or need help with benefits, grants or resources, we will do our best to help you navigate the system. Below is additional information from agencies about common issues:
Social Security and Medicare Resources
Small Business Resources
Student Financial Aid
Military Service Academy Nominations
Veterans Affairs and Military Issues
