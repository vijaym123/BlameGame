Its Your
Money
Tax Day this week is a good reminder of who Congress works for
hard-working families across America. According to data from 2013,
Americans spend more than 6 billion hours and as much as $378 billion
filing their taxes each year - they deserve a fairer, simpler tax code
that fits their lives. Instead, they have an IRS that unfairly targets
conservatives for their political beliefs and taxes them for
dying.
This week, the House passed a series of bills to restore
accountability at the IRS, including the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act and
to repeal the burdensome death tax. West Virginia families should have
peace of mind that the money they earn can serve their children and
grandchildren, not be taken by Uncle Sam.
State
Powers, not Federal Mandates
In the Energy and
Commerce Committee we approved one bill and held a hearing on another
that would return decisions to the states, and away from Washington
bureaucrats.
Legislation I sponsored to protect 316,000 jobs
reliant on the coal ash industry was approved by the Committee and
awaits a vote before the whole House. This bipartisan bill would empower
state governments to make common-sense decisions about managing coal
ash.
At a hearing on Tuesday, an EPA Assistant Administrator
claimed that the new regulations to close coal power plants would
actually reduce Americans energy bills. Seriously.

Strengthening
Medicare
The President signed a bipartisan bill passed
by the House a couple weeks ago to end harmful cuts to Medicare
doctors. By putting in real reforms while protecting those seniors least able
to pay, this compromise law permanently removes the threat to seniors
and their doctors.
But there is still more work to be done
to ensure the Medicare system will last for all Americans into the
future. That is why the Health Subcommittee held a hearing on my
legislation to strengthen Medicares finances while improving care. In
Washington, it is assumed more money is the only way to fix things. Instead,
my bill would help seniors recover faster after a hospital visit and
save money by spending smarter.
Watch my introduction of
the bill:
Dear
President Obama: Lets Use Our Resources
This
President has claims that he is a fighter on energy
except he is always
fighting against using American energy resources. His latest plan to
allow for development of safe oil drilling in the Atlantic Ocean lists
only one permit. And that permit would not allow for drilling until
2021. A plan like this weakens our economy, kills job growth, and ensures
we remain dependent on foreign sources of oil.
Along with
more than a hundred of my colleagues, I signed a letter this week
demanding the President re-think this plan and engage in a common-sense
plan with Congress to put Americans to work by safely using our natural
resources.
Have a great week,
David
