Dear
Friend,
I am deeply saddened by the news of Tommy Boggs
passing. Tommys ambition and business acumen were only matched by his
kindness and generosity. The contributions of the Boggs family to
Louisiana cannot be overstated, and Tommy was no exception. The legacy he
has built will live on for generations to come. My heartfelt sympathies
and prayers are with his family.
Sincerely,
Congressman
