Dear
Friend,
Happy New Year!
January got off to a quick start in Washington.
I was sworn in for my third term as the Representative for SC-05
on January 6, and I was fortunate enough to have most of my family
join me in Washington.
That was a very special day.
Many
of you have participated in my Facebook town hall meetings recently,
and one of the most asked questions was "What is the first thing you
want to do when the new Congress convenes?"
My response, "Restore
the 40-hour work week and pass the Keystone XL Pipeline."
I'm
happy to report we took care of both a couple of weeks ago.
Another thing we tackled was defunding the President's executive
amnesty.
I, along with Reps. Barletta and Aderholt, offered an
amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill
that would defund the President's executive amnesty.
We were joined
by a majority of our colleagues in the House as we passed that
measure.
We can all agree that the federal government is
just too big, inefficient, and unaccountable.
Last week, Rep.
Cynthia Lummis and I filed our
Federal Workforce Reduction Through
Attrition
bill.
The bill limits new federal hires to one
employee for every three that retire or leave service, saving a previously
estimated $35 billion over five years.
I'm hoping to
send more of these updates this year, and I look forward to hearing your
feedback.
Sincerely,
Congressman Mick
Mulvaney
