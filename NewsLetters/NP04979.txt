URGENT: 24 HOUR DEADLINE Hillary Clinton is asking for your help to rescue Democrats in deadlocked races. Donate $5 before our final end of month deadline.
We have some INCREDIBLE news! Check out the NEW Fox News poll numbers:
Democrat 45%
Republicans 44%
This is HUGE: Democratic enthusiasm has surged by 11 points in 2 weeks! If we can keep this going, we can deliver stunning upsets all across the map!!! Now, we HAVE to get-out-the-vote.
The Koch brothers are spending over $60 million to get anti-Obama voters to the polls. We don't have to match them -- but if we want to win, we have to reach out to 1,OOO,OOO Democratic voters in the final 5 days of this campaign.
