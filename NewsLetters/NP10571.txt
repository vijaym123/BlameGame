The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of April 14 - 18, 2014
This week, I enjoyed spending time in the 32nd Congressional District
during the District Work period.
Throughout the week I met with
constituents to give an update on the work I'm doing in Washington to
hold the Obama Administration accountable, get government out of the
way, and put our nation on a sustainable path for the future.
As
always, I appreciate the chance to answer questions and sit down with
individuals in our community to hear their ideas and discuss their
concerns.
Congressman Sessions talking to the
East Dallas Rotary Club
Throughout my meetings this week with the East Dallas Rotary Club, the
Noon Exchange Club of Garland, and the Sachse Chamber of Commerce, the
main topic of conversation was the recent budget proposal passed by the
House.
While the House Republican budget would balance in 10 years, it
was reported this week by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) that President Obama's budget would add $6.6 trillion to the
deficit in the same time frame.

This new report about the president's budget plan confirms that his
plan would take our nation in the wrong direction and would take more
from North Texas families to spend more in Washington.
As I shared
with the groups I met with this week, the House Republican budget
offers a better choice for the future of our nation and sets us on a
path to prosperity instead of bankruptcy.
I will continue to fight for
smarter policies in Congress that will help create a better environment
for job creation and will give relief to families and businesses that
are struggling due to the Administration's current policies.
Congressman Sessions with members of the Sachse Chamber of Commerce
including Chamber President Molly Hall, Chairman John Cooper, Director
Jeff Bickerstaff, Director Nancy Runge, and Ian Halperin.
Tax Day
Tax Day was Tuesday, which means that hardworking North Texas families
were reminded of the massive burdens that the IRS and the current tax
code place on their families.

know your thoughts on our nation's tax code.
