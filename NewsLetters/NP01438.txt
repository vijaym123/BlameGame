It was a busy week as I and my colleagues
worked to stop IRS abuse and modify portions of the tax code, including a
repeal of the estate tax, also known as the death tax.
I
have long-supported getting rid of the death tax to relieve taxation on
a lifetime of hard work.
Americans that have carefully planned
to leave the family farm, small business or life savings with their
children and grandchildren should not have to worry about the federal
government robbing up to 40 percent of what is handed down.
Doing
well for our future generations is a classic American idea the
government should have never trampled on in the first place.
I gladly
voted to lay the death tax to rest and hope the Senate will follow
suit.
Recently, the IRS has further degraded trust from the
American people.
The House passed bills this week to address the
agencys scandal surrounding political targeting of non-profits and the
lack of agency accountability.
The legislation would give IRS
authority to fire employees engaging in political targeting, prevent IRS
from using personal email for official business, grant groups denied
non-profit status a chance to appeal and request status of
investigations involving personal information.
We also passed a Taxpayer
Bill of Rights to ensure taxpayers fair treatment and high quality IRS
service.
On another successful note, the Senate passed the
House bill to end Medicares flawed Sustainable Growth Rate, known as
the doc fix, and the president signed it into law.
No longer
will Medicare doctors face uncertainty with automatic Medicare
reimbursement reductions.
This will improve quality of health care and
service for seniors.
I am optimistic this paves the way for more
serious conversations on reforming Medicare and similar programs in
the future.
