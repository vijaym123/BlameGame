Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
MLK Day in the 10th
This past Monday, I joined with the Cleveland County Branch of the NAACP and other local leaders to commemorate Martin Luther King Day. It was an honor to attend this celebration of his life and pay tribute to his legacy. I would like to thank the Cleveland County NAACP and their President Dante' Murphy for inviting me to attend. Below are some photos taken at the event.
Later Monday, I visited the Laboratory Mill in Lincolnton. The Laboratory Mill is a special event venue that was previously a laboratory during the Civil War and then later a cotton mill in the 20th Century. It has recently been renovated and is a beautiful facility on the banks of the South Fork River.

March for Life in Washington
On Wednesday, Americans from across the country braved freezing temperatures to support the sanctity of life during this year's March for Life. This year was the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade and it was inspirational to see thousands marching in defense of life. Many residents of the 10th District made the trip up for the march including over 100 students from Belmont Abbey College and Hickory's Saint Aloysius Life Teen Group who stopped by my office for a picture.
Crowdfunding Thought Leader
This week I was named one of
Venture Beat's
Top 30 Crowdfunding Thought Leaders. It is an honor to be included in this list with so many other influential leaders in the crowdfunding area. I am glad that our work on crowdfunding legislation in Congress has made a difference to the numerous entrepreneurs around the country who desperately need access to capital. I look forward to continuing to work with these thought leaders, regulators in Washington, and my colleagues in Congress to improve the crowdfunding regulations and help many other businesses get off the ground.

Many of these athletes make very little money and crowdfunding helps them pursue their dreams of winning gold. The article above is about the famous Jamaican bobsled team and this
