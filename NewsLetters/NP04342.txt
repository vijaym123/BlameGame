State-of-the-art VA Health Center Will Meet Growing Needs of West MI
Vets
President Obama Signs the 2014 Farm Bill at Michigan State University
Veterans now have a new, state-of-the-art facility in West Michigan.
Senator Stabenow participated in the grand opening and ribbon cutting
ceremony for the Wyoming Health Care Center in West Michigan. The new
97,000-square-foot center replaces a smaller clinic in the area. "With
so many service members returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the
need to expand our VA clinics has never been greater," Stabenow said.
"The new Wyoming Health Care Center will help ensure that our veterans
have access to the critical health benefits and services they have
earned."

Two Michigan Lakes Get Clean Bills of Health
Two lakes in Michigan - White Lake in West Michigan and Grass Lake in
the Upper Peninsula - got clean bills of health after being on a list
of "toxic hotspots" for decades. In Montague, Senator Stabenow joined
local residents last month for a celebration of the cleanup efforts.
White Lake had long been used as a toxic waste dump before cleanup
efforts began in earnest in the late 1980s. Today, thanks in part to
critical funding from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a
multi-year plan Stabenow championed in Congress, the lake is clean,
wildlife habitats are healthy, and the lake is officially off the list
of "areas of concern."

Increasing Awareness and Resources for Treating Heart Disease in Women
Senator Stabenow led a group of 11 women Senators in an effort to urge
the Obama Administration to prioritize heart disease research and
treatment. In a series of letters to Health and Human Services
Secretary Sylvia Burwell, NIH Director Francis Collins, and CDC
Director Tom Frieden, the bipartisan group of women Senators explained
that women's heart disease continues to be under-researched, frequently
misdiagnosed, and often left untreated. "Unfortunately, a majority of
women and even some doctors are unfamiliar with the symptoms,
diagnoses, and dangers of heart disease in women," said Stabenow. "When
we help educate women and their doctors, create more opportunities for
women to get screenings, and get more money for research, we can fight
this disease and save lives."
