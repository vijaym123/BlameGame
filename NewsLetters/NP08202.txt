Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Happy Independence Day!
Today we celebrate the birth of America and reflect upon the
many blessings of liberty we enjoy as Americans. This nation is a product of our Founding Fathers&rsquo; vision for freedom outlined in the
Declaration of Independence , which was
adopted on July 4, 1776 . We gather as
Americans on this day to honor this vision and spirit.
While we face many challenges as a nation, we meet them head on with the confidence instilled
by the generations of Americans who came before us.
May God bless
all those who have served to protect our freedoms and those who continue to serve the cause of freedom today. May He continue to bless the United
States of America. From my family to yours, I wish you a happy and safe Fourth of July!
Key Facts from Rio Grande Valley Visit
This week, I led a bipartisan group of House
Judiciary Committee Members to the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border to seek information about the sudden surge of children,
teenagers, and families &ndash; largely from Central America &ndash; attempting to enter the U.S. illegally. We had the opportunity to meet with
federal officials from various agencies, tour federal facilities, and witness firsthand the challenges the Border Patrol faces.

trip.
This trip
has confirmed that the current crisis at the border is a disaster of the Administration's own making. If President Obama wants to stop this problem,
he should enforce our immigration laws and quit using his pen and phone to create administrative legalization programs - he has the power to stop this
crisis now. Children&rsquo;s lives are at stake, and so is the integrity of our immigration system.
Saying &quot;YES&quot; to Energy and
Jobs
It does
not make sense for the U.S. to continue building our own roadblocks to energy production. Instead, let&rsquo;s cut through the red tape and get the
projects that have been sitting idle moving as part of a real all-of-the-above energy policy. The Senate has stalled long enough. Saying yes to
unlocking American energy is saying yes to American jobs. As part of the energy solution, the House of Representatives recently passed three bills
that would help America realize its full energy potential. Click
