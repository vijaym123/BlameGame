Dear Friend,
Constituent
Services Are a Top Priority
While people often associate the work of
Congress with debates on legislation, our
office provides a variety of additional
services of which you should be aware. We
have a dedicated staff that is at your
service to assist you with any federal
matter.
Listening to the views and priorities of
Fifth District Virginians on legislative
and policy matters is a critical part of my
job as your representative, and I cannot be
a voice for the best interests of the
district without hearing from you. We
receive hundreds of calls, letters, emails,
and other communications from constituents
each week, and we respond to every single
message as quickly as we can. We encourage
you to remain in touch with us to inform
the debates that take place in
Congress.
Working with federal agencies and
programs can be challenging at times, but
our office can help you cut through federal
red tape. Whether it is helping secure your
Social Security, Medicare, or
Veterans benefits or helping get a
passport or visa, staff in our
Charlottesville and Danville offices can
answer questions you may have and work with
you to resolve the problems you encounter.
Our staff members also hold local office
hours in every single locality throughout
the district once each quarter. A schedule
of upcoming local office hours can be found
on
our
website .
We also love to see folks from the
district who visit our office in
Washington. Our office is happy to help
coordinate your visit to our nations
capital, whether you are interested in
touring the Capitol building, the White
House, the monuments, or other points of
interest. The museums, memorials, and
buildings in Washington belong to you, and
we are here to help you make the most out
of your trip as you explore the history
these places have to offer.
We also have the honor of nominating
candidates for admission to the United
States Military Service Academies each
year. It is a great privilege to work with
such outstanding young people who aspire to
commit themselves to serving in our
military. We also take part in the
Congressional Art Competition each year,
which recognizes the artistic talents of
high school students and the winners
artwork is displayed in the Capitol for the
following year for visitors from around the
country to enjoy.
To learn more about any of the services
listed above and other matters with which
we can be of assistance, please visit our
website,
hurt.house.gov ,
which contains more information on these
topics. You may also call any of our
offices to speak with someone who can
assist you with these matters whether in
Charlottesville (434-973-9631), Danville
(434-791-2596), Farmville (434-395-0120),
or Washington (202-225-4711). We take our
responsibility to serve all Fifth District
Virginians very seriously, and we encourage
you to be in touch with us if we can help
in any way.
