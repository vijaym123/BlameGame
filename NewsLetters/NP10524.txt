News from Congressman Scott Peters
April 15, 2014
Dear Friend,
In addition to meeting with San Diegans visiting D.C., and working on
legislation, there were a few items I wanted to highlight from my last
few weeks in Washington. This week, I am back in San Diego and looking
forward to spending some upcoming time engaging with constituents like
you and visiting local businesses and military installations.
Equal Pay Day
Last Tuesday was Equal Pay Day, the date when women's wages finally
catch up to what men were paid in the previous year. In the 52nd
District women still earn just 75 cents for every dollar earned by
their male counterparts. Closing this wage gap is not only the right
thing to do - it would help women and families across the country. As a
supporter of legislation to end gender based discrimination, it seems
only common sense to me that women should earn equal pay for equal work.
The women on my staff joined me in marking Equal Pay day last week.
Leader in Healthcare Innovation
I have been a vocal advocate for innovation and technology in
healthcare as a way to bend the cost curve and support our local
economy. In the last year, I have introduced two bills in Congress to
promote the use of existing wireless technology in federal healthcare
programs. It was an honor to
receive the Visionary Award
from the California
Healthcare Institute in recognition of my work in this field.
Fighting for our Seniors
Over the last year I've worked with a bipartisan group to stop the
proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage, a program that more than 189,000
San Diegans rely on for their health and well-being. In the last few
weeks, I spoke on the House floor, met with senior White House
officials, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen
Sebelius to argue against these cuts. I was pleased that last Monday it
was announced that the cuts would not come into effect.

Recent Opinion Pieces
As we lead up to Earth Day later this month, I've written two opinion
pieces about the need for more sustainable energy and addressing a
changing climate through community planning and preparedness. The first
highlights how California and San Diego are leading the way in the
solar industry, which is creating jobs across the state and increasing
our use of renewable energy. You can read it here
.
The second is a call for the country to begin addressing the root
causes of climate change, while we simultaneously prepare ourselves for
the extreme weather events that are becoming more common including
wildfires, drought, and rising oceans. You can read that piece here
Stay Connected
I hope you'll stay connected with what I am working on. Like my
Facebook page, follow me on Twitter, add my Google + page
to
your circles, or visit my website for more information.
One of the most important jobs I have in Congress is providing a number
of constituent services. As always if you have any questions, are
having trouble with a federal agency, or want to weigh in on a
particular issue, feel free to email me
or call either of my offices at

Dear
Friend,
In
addition
to
meeting
with
San
Diegans
visiting
D.C.,
and
working
on
legislation,
there
were
a
few
items
I
wanted
to
highlight
from
my
last
few
weeks
in
Washington.
This
week,
I
am
back
in
San
Diego
and
looking
forward
to
spending
some
upcoming
time
engaging
with
constituents
like
you
and
visiting
local
businesses
and
military
installations.
Equal
Pay
Day
Last
Tuesday
was
Equal
Pay
Day,
the
date
when
women's
wages
finally
catch
up
to
what
men
were
paid
in
the
previous
year.
In
the
52nd
District
women
still
earn
just
75
cents
for
every
dollar
earned
by
their
male
counterparts.
Closing
this
wage
gap
is
not
only
the
right
thing
to
do
-
it
would
help
women
and
families
across
the
country.
As
a
supporter
of
legislation
to
end
gender
based
discrimination,
it
seems
only
common
sense
to
me
that
women
should
earn
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
The
women
on
my
staff
joined
me
in
marking
Equal
Pay
day
last
week.

the

I
have
introduced
two

in
Congress
to
promote
the

of

It
was

of

I've

a

that
more
than
189,000

Recent
Opinion
Pieces
As
we
lead
up
to
Earth
Day
later
this
month,
I've
written
two
opinion
pieces
about
the
need
for
more
sustainable
energy
and
addressing
a
changing
climate
through
community
planning
and
preparedness.
The
first
highlights
how
California
and
San
Diego
are
leading
the
way
in
the
solar
industry,
which
is
creating
jobs
across
the
state
and
increasing
our
use
of
renewable
energy.

The
second
is
a
call
for
the
country
to
begin
addressing
the
root
causes
of
climate
change,
while
we
simultaneously
prepare
ourselves
for
the
extreme
weather
events
that
are
becoming
more

including
wildfires,
drought,
and
rising
