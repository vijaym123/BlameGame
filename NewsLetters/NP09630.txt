Fox News: Honoring George Washington with a plan to reclaim America's
spiritual roots
Dear Friend,
It's been one year since the news broke of IRS targeting conservative,
tea party, and faith-based groups for additional scrutiny. As chair of
the Tea Party Caucus, I joined Members of Congress and tea party
activists at the Capitol
to condemn this unacceptable abuse of power.
One year later, there is no accountability-an outcome the American
people have come to expect from the Obama administration. In a new op-ed
on Fox News
, I look back on the last year since the scandal broke
and highlight how the President's inability to hold those under his
command accountable leaves citizens across the country to suffer the
consequences.
Honoring George Washington's Legacy
This year marks the 225th anniversary of George Washington's first
inauguration. Last week, I hosted a prayer event with former Gov. Mike
Huckabee to honor our first President's legacy.
For a third year in a row, Members of Congress and their guests gathered
to pray for the nation and its leaders. President Washington dedicated
our great nation to the glory of God, and this was an opportunity to
recognize what he did and follow his example.

New Flights Connect St. Cloud and Chicago
Last week I was excited to depart Chicago on the inaugural United
Airlines flight to the St. Cloud Regional Airport and also be on the
return flight from St. Cloud to Chicago.
Connecting St. Cloud to Chicago opens up the prospect of bringing new
jobs, investments, and visitors to the region. I joined business owners,
families, elected officials and community leaders on these two flights
who share in this excitement.
I have long been a supporter of the St. Cloud Regional Airport, and I
look forward to their continued growth and success.
