The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of February 3 - 7, 2014
Today's weak jobs report reinforces the fact that the Administration's
policies aren't working for the American people. While the president
boasted in his State of the Union address that we have the lowest
unemployment rate in over five years, he failed to mention that this is
primarily because so many people have stopped looking for work, not
because more Americans have jobs.

Just this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
released a report detailing the negative effects of ObamaCare on our
economy and confirmed what we have known all along - ObamaCare is
America's number one job killer and it must be fully repealed.
Specifically, CBO projects that the law will push 2.5 million people
out of the workforce while reducing hours and wages for those who still
have jobs.
Below are some of the key findings from the CBO report courtesy of the
House Budget Committee:
The deficit will again top $1 trillion by 2022.
Interest on the national debt will quadruple over the next decade.
By 2021, ObamaCare will cause a "reduction in full-time-equivalent
employment of about 2.3 million."
ObamaCare "will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by
about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024."
The largest decline will occur among "lower-wage workers."
ObamaCare "will cause a reduction of roughly 1 percent in aggregate
labor compensation over the 2017-2024 period."
I believe that the people of North Texas deserve better than an
onerous, damaging law that inhibits economic growth. It is time for
President Obama and Senate Democrats to work with House Republicans to
put an end to ObamaCare and focus on real solutions to spur job growth
and increase opportunities for all Americans.
Sportsmen's Package
This week, the House approved H.R. 3590, the Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act of 2013. The SHARE Act is a
bipartisan and bicameral initiative that protects our public lands and
preserves access to traditional hunting, fishing, and recreational
shooting for sportsmen. This important bill also preserves Americans'
constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
American sportsmen contribute roughly $90 billion in economic activity
every year, which helps to sustain thousands of jobs and conserve our
nation's rich outdoors. Unfortunately, the federal government often
imposes unnecessary barriers that prevent Americans from participating
in the many activities available on federal lands. I'm pleased that the
House approved the SHARE Act in order to streamline government
regulations and allow for greater access to our nation's public lands.

Texas Water Day
On Wednesday, I was honored to serve as the keynote speaker for the
10th annual Texas Water Day on Capitol Hill. The event was comprised of
individuals from the Texas Water Conservation Association and I
addressed the important water issues facing the state of Texas.
Congressman Sessions delivering the key note address at Texas Water Day
During my remarks, I discussed the need to reduce federal regulations
and to give more control to local authorities to preserve Texas' water.
Water impacts key elements of the quality of life in Texas - from human
health and economic growth to our natural environment. That is why I am
committed to preserving our water supply, reducing federal regulations,
and giving local government more control over our water.
IBAT
On Thursday, I met with members of the Independent Bankers Association
of Texas (IBAT). IBAT represents Texas community banks and serves as a
resourceful platform for small businesses and consumers.
Congressman Sessions with members of the
Independent Bankers Association of Texas
During our meeting, we discussed ways to halt the constant onslaught of
new burdensome regulatory requirements that are hurting Texas
businesses and increasing costs for consumers across our state. I
enjoyed the opportunity to tell them about my ongoing efforts to fight
to get Washington out of the way and protect North Texas businesses.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

2014
Today&#8217;s
weak
jobs
report
reinforces
the
fact
that
the
Administration's
policies
aren&#8217;t
working
for
the
American
people.
While
the
president
boasted
in
his
State

the
Union
address
that
we
have
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
in
over
five
years,
he
failed
to
mention
that
this
is
primarily
because
so
many
people
have
stopped
looking
for
work,
not
because
more

Just

the
nonpartisan
Congressional

(CBO)
released
a

detailing
the
negative
effects
of
ObamaCare
on
our
economy
and
confirmed
what
we
have

all

&#8211;
ObamaCare
is
America&#8217;s
number

it

CBO

that
the

2.5

Below
are
some
of
the
key

from
the

of
the
House

&#8226;
The

will

top
$1

by
2022.
&#8226;
Interest
on
the
national

&#8226;
By

by
about
1.5

from

The

will

among

&#8226;
ObamaCare
&#8220;will

a
reduction
of
roughly
1
percent
in
aggregate
labor
compensation
over
the
2017&#8211;2024
period.&#8221;
I
believe
that
the
people
of
North
Texas
deserve
better
than
an
onerous,
damaging
law
that
inhibits
economic
growth.
It
is
time
for
President
Obama
and
Senate
Democrats
to
work
with
House
Republicans
to
put
an
end
to
ObamaCare
and
focus
on
real
solutions
to
spur
job
growth
and
increase
opportunities
for
all
Americans.

Texas
Water
Day
On
Wednesday,
I
was
honored
to
serve
as
the
keynote
speaker
for
the
10th

of
Texas.
Congressman

discussed
the
need
to
reduce
federal
regulations
and
to
give
more
control
to
local
authorities
to
preserve
Texas&#8217;
water.
Water
impacts
key
elements
of
the
quality
of
life
in
Texas
&#8211;
from
human
health
and
economic
growth
to
our

That
is
why
I

preserving
our
water
supply,
reducing
federal
regulations,
and
giving
local

more
control
over
our
water.
