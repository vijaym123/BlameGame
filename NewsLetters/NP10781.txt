Should the House extend emergency unemployment insurance for the
long-term unemployed through the end of May?
YES - Millions of long-term out-of-work Americans are counting on
Congress to extend emergency unemployment insurance
MAYBE - The House should consider a different piece of legislation that
helps long-term out-of-work Americans
NO - Congress should not extend emergency unemployment insurance for
the millions of long-term out-of-work Americans

This Monday was the 51st anniversary of the Equal Pay Act being signed
into law by President John F. Kennedy. This historic act prohibited pay
discrimination against women.
Sadly, women still earn on average 77 cents for every dollar a man
earns. Congress must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will ensure
equal pay for equal work for all women in the workplace, because when
women succeed, America succeeds.
Nationally recognized as "Equal Pay Day," President Obama on Monday
announced two new executive actions to help women achieve equal pay for
equal work - starting with our federal contractors.

Cambodian Culture Festival
Last Sunday, I was proud to participate in Long Beach's Cambodian
Culture Festival. This annual festival in Cambodia Town - the mile-long
business corridor along Anaheim Street between Atlantic and Junipero
Avenues - celebrates the many contributions our Cambodian community,
nearly 20,000 strong, has made to the city.
Community Coffee at the Los Alamitos-Rossmoor Library
Please join me on Saturday, April 26th at 10:00 a.m. for another one of
my community coffees. I'll be giving a Congressional update and, as
always, taking your questions. Come enjoy a cup of coffee and join the
discussion about the important issues impacting our community.
Please RSVP to my Long Beach office at (562) 436-3828.
SAVE THE DATE: Service Academy Night
Every year, my office nominates outstanding high school students to
attend one of four service academies - the Air Force Academy, the
Merchant Marine Academy, the Military Academy at West Point, and the
Naval Academy.
The fifth service academy, the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy, does not require a Congressional nomination, but my office
still helps students apply.
On Wednesday, May 14th, my office will be hosting a Service Academy
Night at the Oxford Academy in Cypress. I encourage you to save the
date and pass this invitation along to your friends and family.
The Essential Nature of Discretionary Spending
For the past few days, Congress has been debating various budget
proposals, including Congressman Paul Ryan's budget. His budget takes
more of a "cut and slash" approach than I would like to see in a
budget. Unfortunately, the non-defense discretionary side of the budget
- meaning more flexible, non-mandatory spending - has taken a beating
over the years with extreme cuts.
Non-defense discretionary spending includes money for education, public
safety, clean drinking water, food safety, roads, bridges, and medical
research. In my opinion, there is nothing "discretionary" about these
programs.
We need to stop using the word 'discretionary,' and instead replace it
with "essential." The programs mentioned above, including many more,
are all essential programs that keep our country strong, healthy, and
safe.
On Wednesday, I spoke out against Rep. Ryan's budget and in support of
the Congressional Progressive Caucus' alternative proposed budget,
which recognizes non-defense essential spending as an investment in the
future of our country.

STEM Education For Our Nation's Youth
This week, I testified in front of the House Armed Services Committee
and requested that they reinstate the Department of Defense's STARBASE
program and authorize it at $30 million.
Click here
or the picture above to watch my testimony.
Providing Science, Technology, Education and Math (STEM) education to
America's youth is critical to the global competitiveness of our
nation. The Department of Defense's STARBASE program is one of the most
cost-effective STEM education programs across all of the federal
government, costing an average of only $343 per student. Last year,
3,062 classes were conducted with students from 413 school districts
across the country. In fact, we have a STARBASE program right here in
the 47th District at the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base.

Action on Unemployment Insurance
On Monday, the Senate passed the Emergency Unemployment Compensation
Extension Act by a vote of 59 to 38, which retroactively extends
emergency unemployment insurance through the end of May.
Bipartisan action in the Senate on unemployment insurance is a crucial
step for economic security for 2.8 million Americans, of which 514,300
are Californians
, and now is the time for long
overdue action in the House. The 2.8 million unemployed were cut off
from unemployment insurance on December 28, 2013, and have suffered
without resources for three months. The loss of funds for the long-term
unemployed has cost our state's economy more than $830 million
.
The bipartisan Senate agreement, as well as the House companion bill,
would:
Retroactively restore emergency unemployment insurance for five
months;
Exclude millionaires from receiving emergency unemployment insurance;
Strengthen efforts to help get job seekers back into the workforce;
Be fully paid for with pension smoothing and extending fees on U.S.
customs users through 2024.
It is time for Speaker Boehner and House Republicans to listen to the
American people and restore this vital economic lifeline that helps
people support their families and pay their bills while they look for a
new job. To force action, not only have I cosponsored Congressman
Kildee's companion bill to the Senate bill, but I have joined with 193
of my Democratic colleagues in signing a petition to hold an immediate
vote on extending unemployment insurance.
"House & Senate Gallery"
Each chamber of Congress has a public seating area called a "gallery"
that overlooks each chamber. Both galleries have separate seating
sections for the public, members of the press and media, staff, and
family members. When Congress is in session, people in the gallery must
remain silent as members of Congress vote or debate the day's
legislative business.
The House gallery reserved for members of the press is located behind
the Speaker's rostrum and just in front of the voting board.
When you come to Washington, D.C., my staff can help you and your
friends and family get gallery passes so you can experience a little
piece of the legislative process. Learn more about visiting Washington,
D.C. by going to my website:

How do you think Congress should consider the two separate budget
proposals?
44.7%
Congress should work together to find a compromise between the
two proposals
26.7%
Congress should pass the President's proposed budget
25.2%
Congress should pass Chairman Ryan's proposed budget
3.4 %

The

Spending
For
the

Congress
has
been
debating
various
budget
proposals,
including
Congressman
Paul
Ryan&#8217;s
budget.
His
budget
takes
more
of
a
&#8220;cut
and
slash&#8221;
approach
than
I
would
like
to
see
in
a

Unfortunately,
the
non-defense
discretionary
side
of
the
budget
&#8211;
meaning
more
flexible,
non-mandatory
spending
&#8211;
has
taken
a
beating
over
the

with
extreme
cuts.
Non-defense
discretionary
spending
includes
money
for
education,
public
safety,
clean
drinking
water,
food
safety,
roads,
bridges,
and
medical
research.
In
my
opinion,
there
is
nothing
&#8220;discretionary&#8221;
about
these
programs.
We
need
to
stop
using
the
word
&#8216;discretionary,&#8217;
and
instead
replace
it
with
&#8220;essential.&#8221;
The
programs
mentioned
above,
including
many
more,
are
all
essential
programs
that
keep
our
country
strong,
healthy,
and
safe.
On
Wednesday,
I
spoke
out
against
Rep.
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
and
in
support
of
the
Congressional
Progressive
Caucus&#8217;
alternative
proposed
budget,
which
recognizes
non-defense
essential
spending
as

Action
on
Unemployment
Insurance
On
Monday,
the
Senate
passed
the
Emergency
Unemployment
Compensation
Extension
Act
by
a
vote
of
59
to
38,
which
retroactively
extends
emergency
unemployment
insurance
through
the
end
of
May.
Bipartisan
action
in
the
Senate
on
unemployment
insurance
is
a
crucial
step
for
economic
security
for
2.8
million
Americans,
of
which
514,300
are
Californians ,
and
now
is
the
time
for
long
overdue
action
in
the
House.
The
2.8
million
unemployed
were
cut
off
from
unemployment
insurance
on
December
28,
2013,
and
have
suffered
without
resources
for
three
months.
The
loss
of
funds
for
the
long-term
unemployed
has
cost
our
state&#8217;s
economy
more
than
$830
million .
The
bipartisan
Senate
agreement,
as
well
as
the
House
companion
bill,
would:
&#8226; Retroactively
restore
emergency
unemployment
insurance
for
five
months; &#8226; Exclude
millionaires
from
receiving
emergency
unemployment
insurance; &#8226; Strengthen
efforts
to
help
get
job
seekers
back
into
the
workforce; &#8226; Be
fully
paid
for
with
pension
smoothing
and
extending
fees
on
U.S.
customs
users
through
2024.
It
is
time
for
Speaker
Boehner
and
House
Republicans
to
listen
to
the
American
people
and
restore
this
vital
economic
lifeline
that
helps
people
support
their
families
and
pay
their
bills
while
they
look
for
a
new
job.
To

not
only
