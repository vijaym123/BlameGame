Rubio Releases Constituent Service
Report As His Office Marks 500
th
Mobile Office Hours
Event
On Thursday, Marcos office
released
a report
highlighting various stories that
exemplify the work his constituent service
team has done to assist Floridians with
federal services over the first three and a
half years of his term. The reports
publication comes as Marcos office
holds its 500
th
Mobile Office Hour event with
an identity theft and scam prevention
seminar in Winter Park, Florida.
A PDF of the report is available
here
.
Marco also issued
a video
statement
to mark the milestone.
Below is a transcript of his video
message:
Today, my office and I are
proud to celebrate our 500
th
Mobile Office Hours event,
with an identity theft and scam
prevention seminar thats being
held in Winter Park, Florida.
Since my election in 2010, my
biggest priority has been making sure
that my staff and I are available to help
constituents with whatever federal
assistance they may need.
Case after case, we have been
reminded of how the federal government
impacts
and sometimes stands in
the way of
peoples ability
to achieve the American Dream.
Whether its the case of
a constituent whose tax refund is
delayed, or by helping one of our
veterans who is having a problem
receiving their benefits. Or a matter of
expediting a visa or a passport, or by
putting together seminars that aim to
protect Floridians from scams or identity
theft
my office and I always
stand ready and willing to help.
More than halfway through my
Senate term, I am most proud of knowing
that we have made a real difference in
the lives of real people. Our service to
our constituents has come to be the
single, most rewarding part of my
job.
Today, as we mark this occasion
of our 500
th
Mobile Office Hours event,
my office and I renew our commitment to
serve the people of Florida to the very
best of our abilities.
Rubio Urges Administration To Advocate
For The Return Of U.S. Marine Jailed In
Mexico
On Thursday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding a Mexican judges
ruling to send Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, a
U.S. Marine from South Florida, back to
prison:
I am very dismayed by the
judicial order to continue detaining Sgt.
Andrew Tahmooressi in Mexico. Sgt.
Tahmooressi has been languishing in a
Mexican prison long enough.
My office met with Sgt.
Tahmooressis mother in Florida
last week and has been in contact with
the family from the start of this ordeal.
We remain committed to doing whatever we
can to assist them during this difficult
time.
Its time for the Obama
Administration to wake up and advocate
for his return home. The Obama
Administrations virtual silence
and inaction on Sgt. Tahmooressis
case has been beyond troubling.
Its sheer indifference. The Obama
Administration needs to step up our
diplomatic efforts to bring this Marine
home.
Rubio To Obama: Punish Human Rights
Violators In Venezuela
On Wednesday, Marco urged President
Obama to take immediate action to impose
visa bans and asset freezes on Venezuelan
officials and their families involved in
the brutal crackdown of peaceful protestors
by the Maduro regime.
In
a letter to
Obama
, Marco requested that Obama punish
individuals involved in brutal human rights
abuses and corruption by preventing them
from traveling to and investing in the
United States, and stated his intention to
seek Senate passage of his bipartisan bill
imposing targeted sanctions on these
individuals.
Three months ago, the Senate
unanimously passed a resolution urging
you to impose targeted sanctions,
including visa bans and asset freezes,
against officials involved in this
ongoing repression. I have been working
with Senators Menendez and Nelson on
legislation that would impose such
sanctions immediately,
wrote Rubio . I intend to
seek Senate passage of this bill in the
coming weeks, a version of which the
House of Representatives has already
passed, to ensure that Congress continues
to send a strong message to the Maduro
regime.
I urge you to heed these
bipartisan calls from Congress and take
action immediately. You already have the
ability to begin to make life more
difficult for those involved in brutal
human rights abuses and
corruption,
added Rubio . By preventing
these individuals and their families from
traveling to and investing in the United
States, you can make clear that those who
violate the Venezuelan people's
fundamental freedoms will pay a
significant price.
Rubio Discusses Human Trafficking During
Subcommittee Hearing
Marco, the ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, stressed the
importance of stigmatizing the
international sex tourism industry as a key
part of combatting human trafficking
abroad. Rubio made his comments during
a subcommittee
hearing
entitled, Combating Forced
Labor and Modern-Day Slavery in East Asia
and The Pacific.
Marco also questioned the U.S.
Department of State witnesses regarding
allegations that its Trafficking in Persons
Report has been unduly politicized in
designating problem countries, in addition
to the problem of trafficking in child
soldiers.
A video of the full exchange is
available
here
.
Rubio:
Just here, domestically, I think
one of the most important things we need to
continue to do
and this is more of
an editorial statement
is we need
to make it very clear there is nothing
culturally acceptable about going to these
other countries, as Americans, and
participating in these sorts of
things.
I mean, theres this
attitude, that Ive run into now
and then, where things we would never do
in this country is ok if we do it
somewhere else because in those countries
its culturally acceptable in some
way.
I think youve seen this
reflected, sometimes, in popular culture,
but even anecdotally among people. And I
think one of the things -- we have to be
very clear in that there is nothing
acceptable about us, or Americans, going
abroad to one of these countries and
going into brothels at all, not to
mention those that have people underage
working there.
And I think thats
important to point out because we do find
the presence of Westerners and Americans
frequenting some of these places that
weve talked about in the sex
trafficking industry, and we should truly
try to stigmatize that in our
society.

Agency Updates
IRS Warns of Pervasive Telephone
Scam
The Internal Revenue Service warned
consumers about a sophisticated phone scam
targeting taxpayers, throughout the
country. Victims are told they owe money to
the IRS and it must be paid promptly
through a pre-loaded debit card or wire
transfer. If the victim refuses to
cooperate, they are then threatened with
arrest, deportation or suspension of a
business or drivers license. In many
cases, the caller becomes hostile and
insulting.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS, heres
what you should do:
If you know you owe taxes or you
think you might owe taxes, call the IRS
at
1.800.829.1040
. The IRS employees at that
line can help you with a payment issue
if there really is such an
issue.
If you know you dont owe taxes
or have no reason to think that you owe
any taxes (for example, youve
never received a bill or the caller made
some bogus threats as described above),
then call and report the incident to the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration at
1.800.366.4484
.
If youve been targeted by this
scam, you should also contact the Federal
Trade Commission and use their FTC
Complaint Assistant at
FTC.gov
. Please add "IRS Telephone
Scam" to the comments of your
complaint.
