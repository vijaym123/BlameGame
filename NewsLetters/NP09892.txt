Update from Senator Bob Corker
May 11,
2014
Reaffirming Support for Congressional Earmark
Ban
Last week, Senator Corker joined a bipartisan group of members of
Congress in calling on the Senate and House of Representatives leadership to
continue the moratorium on congressional earmarking.
I
fully support the continued moratorium on congressional earmarks, and
believe members of Congress are more than able to represent the
priorities of their state through the federal budget process and without
earmarks, said Corker.
The senator has voted on several
occasions to impose a full Congress-wide moratorium on
earmarking.

Bring Back Our
Girls
Senator
Corker joined his Senate colleagues last week in condemning the
abduction of more than 200 Nigerian school girls by the terrorist group Boko
Haram on April 14. The resolution called for the safe, immediate return
of the girls.
My prayers are with the families of the
more than 200 abducted Nigerian school girls. Im proud the Senate came
together on Tuesday to pass a resolution condemning this horrific act,
said Corker.
Partnering with Google to Help Tennessee Small
Businesses
Senator Corker is partnering with Google to help Tennessee
small businesses. Representatives from Google will host a
Tennessee Get Your Business Online
event in Chattanooga on
Monday, May 19.
At the Tennessee Get Your Business Online
event, Google experts will help small business owners create a free
website, and those in attendance will receive a customized domain name, free
web hosting for one year, a local business listing on Google Maps, and
additional tools, training and resources. The Google experts will
also help train business owners on how to reach more customers
online.
As a former mayor and businessman, I appreciate the role
small businesses play in communities across Tennessee, said Corker. I
am proud to partner with Google to host this event and hope local
businesses will take advantage of this outstanding opportunity to kickstart
and build their online presence.
The event, which is free
and open to all Tennesseans, is designed to provide an easy and fast
way for businesses to create a website and become more visible online.
While 97 percent of Internet users look online for local products and
services, 59 percent of Tennessee small businesses do not have a
website or online presence.
The perception that getting online
is complex, costly and time-consuming has prevented many Tennessee
small businesses from taking the first step, said Soo Young Kim,
Director of Google's Get Your Business Online program. This program makes
it fast, easy and free for businesses to get online."
