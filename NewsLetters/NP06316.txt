20 years ago&hellip; The Violence Against Women Act was signed into law.
On this 20th anniversary of VAWA, sign your name and add your voice to join the fight to end violence against women: The law created critical protections that held violent offenders accountable and extended services to domestic violence survivors. BUT&hellip; Republicans in Congress are against the bill and blocked its funding for more than 500 days. Don&rsquo;t let them get away with it. Help us reach 1OO,OOO today demanding Republicans stop blocking protections for domestic violence survivors: SIGN ON &rarr; http://action.dccc.org/Vawa-2014
