The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering allowing
cell phone calls in airplanes. Should cell phone calls be allowed
during flights?
Yes - you should be able to make cell phone calls
Yes - you should be able to use your cell phone for navigating the
internet, but not for making calls
Maybe
No - this a security risk and could be a nuisance to other passengers

Last week, the world witnessed the passing of South African civil
rights leader, Nelson Mandela. He has been called a hero, a
revolutionary, and an icon. But these words are too small to encompass
a spirit and life that were larger than words. He changed the course of
an entire nation and an entire people. For a man who gave so much, who
survived and triumphed over crushing adversity and in the processes
helped free his nation from the shackles of apartheid, now it is his
turn to rest. The South African people have lost a great leader and the
world has lost a great man.
One of Nelson Mandela's most famous quotes is: "After climbing a great
hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb." This
could not be any more fitting for the hill we are faced with as we end
the first session of this Congress. Today is the last day of first
session of the 113th Congress, and, thankfully, critical deals were
finally agreed upon.
THE BUDGET DEAL, THE AUTHORIZATION OF DEFENSE FUNDING
Yesterday, the House finally voted on and passed a long-awaited budget
package.
Labeled the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, the deal sets overall
discretionary spending for the current fiscal year at $1.012 trillion-
about halfway between the Senate budget level of $1.058 trillion and
the House budget level of $967 billion. The agreement also provides $63
billion in sequester relief over two years, split evenly between
defense and non-defense programs.
The budget agreement is a good first step toward bringing our budget
process back to some state of normalcy. It is a positive sign that the
agreement was crafted in a bipartisan manner. Is it the perfect
solution? Of course not. But that is the nature of compromise - both
sides giving and getting. Collaboration and compromise is the way
Congress is supposed to work, and I'm glad to see that it is still
possible.
The authorization to fund the Department of Defense, referred to as the
FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act, is a bipartisan, bicameral
agreement that specifies the budget and expenditures of the United
States Department of Defense and establishes funding levels and sets
the policies under which money will be spent.
On Thursday, this bill
was also voted on and passed. I voted "yes."
Despite the partisan and political battles, I believe the passage of
these two votes
marks an historic accomplishment for the 113th
Congress. Yes - we finally have a budget compromise, but there still
remains so much more to accomplish.
HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BASIC RIGHTS
The rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
uphold the same basic principles of liberty
and freedom enshrined within the United State Constitution and Bill of
Rights. A Resolution that I introduced
on Tuesday, supported
by dozens of my colleagues, honors the 65th Anniversary of Human Rights
Day and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). My hope is
that it will shed much needed light on the importance and protection of
human rights in our global society.
Whether it is negotiating trade agreements between countries, promoting
democracy at home and abroad, or combating discrimination based on
race, gender, or sexual orientation and gender identity, human rights
play a critical role in our everyday lives and the lives of people
around the world. The Congress, and the world, must recognize that
those who are denied basic human rights, such as the freedoms of speech
and religious or political expression, are therefore denied an
opportunity to be treated with respect and with dignity.

DISCRETIONARY vs. NON-DISCRETIONARY SPENDING
As mentioned earlier, the House passed the Bipartisan Budget Act, which
sets overall discretionary spending for the current fiscal year at
$1.012 trillion. Discretionary spending refers to the portion of
federal government spending that is decided upon by Congress each
fiscal year through appropriations bills and they are usually divided
into two categories: defense and non-defense. Discretionary spending is
used to fund departments, agencies, and programs such as the Department
of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency, and our nation's
nutritional assistance programs. A good way to remember this fact is to
know that "discretionary" spending requires Congress' "discretion" or
action.
Discretionary spending is different from mandatory spending, which is
also called "non-discretionary spending." Non-discretionary spending
goes toward programs such as Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid
(in California, Medicaid is called "Medi-Cal"). The funding for these
programs is, unlike discretionary programs, required by law.

Last

the
world
witnessed
the
passing
of
South
African
civil
rights
leader,
Nelson
Mandela.
He
has
been
called
a

a

and
an

But
these
words
are
too
small
to
encompass
a
spirit
and
life
that
were
larger
than
words.
He
changed
the
course
of
an
entire
nation
and
an
entire
people.
For
a
man
who
gave
so
much,
who
survived
and

over
crushing
adversity
and
in
the

helped
free
his

now
it

The
South
African
people
have
lost
a
great
leader
and
the
world
has
lost
a
great
man.
One
of
Nelson
Mandela&#8217;s
most
famous
quotes
is:
&#8220;After
climbing
a
great
hill,
one
only
finds
that
there
are
many
more
hills
to

This
could
not
be
any
more
fitting
for
the
hill
we
are
faced
with
as
we
end
the
first
session
of
this
Congress.
Today
is
the
last
day
of
first
session
of
the
113th
Congress,
and,
thankfully,
critical
deals
were
finally
agreed
upon.
THE
BUDGET
DEAL,
THE
AUTHORIZATION
OF
DEFENSE
FUNDING
Yesterday,
the
House
finally
voted
on
and
passed
a
long-awaited
budget
package.
Labeled
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013,
the
deal
sets
overall
discretionary
spending
for
the
current
fiscal
year
at
$1.012
trillion&#8212;about
halfway
between
the
Senate
budget
level
of
$1.058
trillion
and
the
House
budget
level
of
$967
billion.
The
agreement
also
provides
$63
billion
in
sequester
relief
over
two
years,
split
evenly
between
defense
and
non-defense
programs.
The
budget
agreement
is
a
good
first
step
toward
bringing
our
budget
process
back
to
some
state
of
normalcy.
It
is
a
positive
sign
that
the
agreement
was
crafted
in
a
bipartisan
manner.
Is
it
the
perfect
solution?
Of
course
not.
But
that
is
the
nature
of
compromise
&#8211;
both
sides
giving
and
getting.
Collaboration
and
compromise
is
the
way
Congress
is
supposed
to
work,
and
I'm
glad
to
see
that
it
is
still
possible.
The
authorization
to
fund
the
Department
of
Defense,
referred
to
as
the
FY2014
National
Defense
Authorization
Act,
is
a
bipartisan,
bicameral
agreement
that
specifies
the
budget
and
expenditures
of
the
United
States
Department
of
Defense
and
establishes
funding
levels
and
sets
the
policies
under
which
money
will
be
spent.
On
Thursday,
this
bill
was
also
voted
on
and
passed.
I
voted
&#8220;yes.&#8221;
Despite
the
partisan
and
political
battles,
I
believe
the
passage
of
these
two
votes
marks
an
historic
accomplishment
for
the
113th
Congress.
Yes
-
we
finally
have
a
budget
compromise,
but
there
still
remains
so
much
more
to
accomplish.
HUMAN
RIGHTS
ARE
BASIC
RIGHTS
The
rights
enshrined
in
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
uphold
the
same
basic
principles
of
liberty
and
freedom
enshrined
within
the
United
State
Constitution
and
Bill
of
Rights.
A
Resolution
that
I
introduced
on
Tuesday,
supported
by
dozens
of
my
colleagues,
honors
the
65th
Anniversary
of
Human
Rights
Day
and
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
(UDHR).
My
hope
is
that
it
will
shed
much
needed
light
on
the
importance
and
protection
of
human
rights
in
our
global
society.
Whether
it
is
negotiating
trade
agreements
between
countries,
promoting
democracy
at
home
and
abroad,
or
combating
discrimination
based
on
race,
gender,
or
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity,
human
rights
play
a
critical
role
in
our
everyday
lives
and
the
lives
of
people
around
the
world.
The
Congress,
and
the
world,
must
recognize
that
those
who
are
denied
basic
human
rights,
such
as
the
freedoms
of
speech
and
religious
or
political
expression,
are
therefore
denied
an
opportunity
to
be
treated
with
respect
and
with
dignity.

DISCRETIONARY
vs.
NON-DISCRETIONARY
SPENDING
As
mentioned
earlier,
the
House
passed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act,
which
sets
overall
discretionary
spending
for
the
current
fiscal
year
at
$1.012
trillion.
Discretionary
spending
refers
to
the
portion
of
federal
government
spending
that
is
decided
upon
by
Congress
each
fiscal
year
through
appropriations
bills
and
they
are
usually
divided
into
two
categories:
defense
and
non-defense.
Discretionary
spending
is
used
to
fund
departments,
agencies,
and
programs
such
as
the
Department
of
Education,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
and
our
nation&#8217;s
nutritional
assistance
programs.
A
good
way
to
remember
this
fact
is
to
know
that
&#8220;discretionary&#8221;
spending
requires
Congress&#8217;
&#8220;discretion&#8221;
or
action.
Discretionary
spending
is
different
from
mandatory
spending,
which
is
also
called
&#8220;non-discretionary
spending.&#8221;
Non-discretionary
spending
goes
toward
programs
such
as
Medicare,
Social
Security,
and
Medicaid
(in
California,
Medicaid
is
called
&#8220;Medi-Cal&#8221;).
The
funding
for
these
programs
is,
unlike
discretionary
programs,
required
by
law.
