Memorial Day Message
May 25, 2015
A Solemn
Day of
Remembrance
Since the birth of our Nation, our sons and daughters have been willing to fight for what this country stands for. They stood tall against the strongest military in the world and won our freedom. They defeated fascism in Europe and imperialism in the Pacific. They countered communism in Korea and Vietnam. And today, they fight Islamic extremism. They have made America a beacon of hope for countless people around the world and a place we are proud to call home.
It is the dedication of these brave men and women that has kept our country free and grown it into the greatest Nation on earth. This greatness is rivaled only by the selflessness of those who have worn our uniform.
Memorial Day is a time to reflect on the enormous sacrifices of countless heroes past, who gave their lives so we could live ours in peace. But our fallen warriors have earned much more than just a holiday. They have earned our eternal respect and gratitude. Today and throughout the year, please keep Americas fallen veterans in your thoughts and prayers. Strive to honor their memory, while we as a Nation care for the loved ones they left behind.
