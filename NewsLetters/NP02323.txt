Dear
Friend,
Each month,
I record a video address that recaps what
we've been working on the previous month.
Video and text of February's Monthly
Video Address are available below. You

Hi,
Im Robert Hurt. Thank you for
tuning into our Monthly Video
Address.Over the last four years, I
have heard more and more from the people
I represent about the devastating
consequences of the Presidents
healthcare law. My constituents
relate devastating experiences ranging
from not being able to keep the
healthcare plans they have always counted
on, to being hit with spikes in insurance
premiums, co-pays, and deductibles, and
having their working hours cut.
This very flawed law must be
repealed
and replaced
with real patient-centered and
market-oriented healthcare that does not
destroy jobs or reduce wages and puts the
power in the hands of individuals and
families, not the federal government. One
of the first actions we took in February
was a vote to repeal the
Presidents healthcare law.
Building on
the work that we did in January,
we
passed this month the
Senate
amendments to the Keystone XL
Pipeline
. The Keystone XL Pipeline is a
crucial piece of our energy strategy
aimed at giving Americans more affordable
energy choices. Representatives and
Senators from both sides of the aisle
were able to come together to pass this
important legislation, and it is high
time that President Obama also comes to
the table to work together.
I will
continue to work with my colleagues to
implement a robust domestic energy
strategy that will lower gas prices,
create new American jobs, strengthen our
national security, and make life easier
for our families, Main Street businesses,
and small farms.
While more
than six months overdue, I was pleased
that also this month
the
President finally began the process
of seeking the
appropriate
congressional authorization to combat
ISIL in Iraq and Syria
. The Constitution requires the
President to obtain authorization from
Congress to wage war, and the American
people and their representatives in
Congress must be afforded the opportunity
to engage in an honest and candid debate
on the scope of any military action
before sending our brave men and women
into harms way. It is my hope that
the President and his Administration
provide greater detail about strategy for
engagement, troop levels, and end goals
of the conflict.
Finally,
this month, we lost two American heroes:
D-Day veterans
Glenwood
Hankins of Martinsville
and
Bob
Sales of Madison Heights
. They were among the first
soldiers who landed on Normandy on D-Day,
and they represent the best our country
has to offer. We mourn the loss of
Mr. Hankins and Mr. Sales, and we remain
forever grateful for the selfless
sacrifices that they made in the name of
liberty and freedom.
