David, I need your urgent support:
There&rsquo;s only one House race in the entire country that remains too-close-to-call.
It&rsquo;s the same Southern Arizona district I represented when I was in Congress.
Ron Barber is a good friend and a good Congressman. Right now his race is within 0.07% -- or a 161 vote margin.
Ron can absolutely win this race once all the votes are counted, but his opponents are working to make sure that doesn&rsquo;t happen. Hundreds of voters are being silenced. Their ballots remain uncounted.
Ron's opponents will find any way they can to win, which means Ron&rsquo;s campaign needs the resources to fight back and challenge every trick they try to pull.
Can I count on you to contribute $5 to Ron Barber so he has the resources to make sure every vote is counted? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Ron has always put Southern Arizona first, and he needs our support now more than ever.
