Wisdom of the District: The Crisis on Our Border
The broad nature of our southern border poses many challenges when it comes to enforcing our nations immigration laws.
Recently, the number of unaccompanied Central American children smuggled
into the United States through Mexico has increased dramatically.
Through June, Customs and Border Protection agents have apprehended 52,000 unaccompanied minors, more than twice the number apprehended last year.
Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson recently said up to 90,000 minors could illegally cross the border by the end of the summer.

How should the federal government respond to this growing crisis?
( )
These children are illegally brought here by smugglers and they need to be humanely and promptly returned to their home countries. We are a nation of laws and our failure to secure our border will provide an incentive for more illegal migration.
( )
These children are victims of poverty and crime, and our country needs to increase humanitarian efforts in their home countries and allow the children to remain in the United States.
