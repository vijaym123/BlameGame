Happy Birthday
America!
I love the Fourth of July because it brings
together friends and foes, strangers and
neighbors, men and women from every political
persuasion and cause in a collective moment of
celebration of America.
With these timeless words
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
all men are created equal, that they are endowed
by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of Happiness
a nation
was born. This Declaration of Independence
was much more than a birth announcement, it was a
bold affirmation of the rights and freedoms for
which men and women were willing to sacrifice
everything, even their very lives, to
preserve.
While celebrating this document, much
discussion has always centered on the right to
life and liberty. I often like to
ponder the foresight our Founding Fathers had
when they included the unalienable right to
pursue happiness. Few other political
documents throughout the world discuss the right
of citizens to be happy. What a simple, yet
profound inclusion.
Freedom enables happiness. Freedom
resonates deep in our souls, creating
opportunities to pursue happiness unavailable in
the absence of basic liberty.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower once
said:
Freedom has its life in the hearts, the
actions, the spirit of men and so it must be
daily earned and refreshed
else like a
flower cut from its life-giving roots, it will
wither and die.
I have the treasured opportunity as a United
States Senator to observe freedom flourishing in
the hearts of Utahns from corner to corner of our
beautiful state. Our freedom and liberty is
the heart of our nation.
Freedom is expressed in the service performed
every day by brave men and women at home and
abroad who wear our nations uniform.
It can be found at neighborhood celebrations, in
our schools, our churches, and our grocery
stores. Freedom is evident in the smiles of
young children attending parades today, and in
the tears of proud veterans who salute our
flag.
As we celebrate this historic day, I hope we
all take a moment to ponder the blessing of
freedom and enjoy the happiness it can
bring.
Perhaps Daniel Webstersaid it best,
May the sun in his course visit no land
more free, more happy, more lovely, than this our
own country!
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you and
our nation.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
