LEGISLATION
May 03, 2015
Dear David,
Earlier this month, the
Veterans Affairs committee held a hearing to further investigate the Oakland
Regional VA's systemic dysfunction that was made public thanks to
whistleblowers who contacted my office. An investigation by the Office of
the Inspector General (OIG) corroborated these troubling reports of
unprocessed claims being left in a file cabinet for decades.
Mrs. RustyAnn Brown , a veteran of the U.S.
Navy and former employee at the Oakland VA Regional Office, flew to DC
to bravely testify about her experiences working on a special team
that was assigned to process these claims.
Mrs. Brown discussed
how
Oakland VA managers intentionally neglected 13,184 informal
benefits claims, some for over a decade, and then attempted to cover up
their failures. I questioned the Oakland VA Director on these
mishandled claims and how we can make sure each and every veteran receives the
benefits and service they deserve. To view the full hearing,

This past
week, Congress passed
H.R. 2029, the
Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act . In addition to providing critical funding to the
Department of Veterans Affairs, this measure contains important reforms
to speed up VA claims processing, including 770 new staff members to
tackle claims issues. It also funds an electronic health record
system and requires disclosure of the VAs progress toward reducing the
171,000 disability claims that have been pending for more than 125
days. In order to prevent problems like those we found in Oakland,
I offered an amendment
requiring the
VA to report all informal claims to Congress. My amendment was adopted
unanimously, and I appreciate the support it received from my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
Please continue to share
your thoughts with me via email, survey response, or by calling my
office. I value your perspective. To follow me throughout the week and hear

Sincerely,
