Dear Friend,
As 2013 comes to a close, now is time to look toward 2014 and the challenges ahead. Some people make resolutions at the start of the New Year, some set goals. For my part, I see five key goals for the upcoming year&#58;
1.
During my time as your voice in the halls of Congress, I have been shocked by the extraordinary power federal agencies like the IRS and EPA have to create rules and regulations. Many of President Obama&#39;s policies are too extreme to be supported by Congress and the President has used federal agencies to implement policy on everything from coal&#45;fired power plants to our healthcare system. In 2014 I plan to look at new ways to curb the power federal agencies have to regulate the lives of Missouri families.
2.
For too long, Congress has spent money that we simply do not have. Our nation's crushing national debt is the biggest threat to our national security. We cannot continue spending money that we simply do not have. Congress needs to pass a budget and we need to move appropriations bills through committee and onto the House floor for a vote. For too long Congress has given up the power of the purse strings by passing continuing resolutions that allow Washington bureaucrats to prioritize spending. I am hopeful that 2014 can be the year when Congress regains control of the purse strings and actually passes a budget.
3.
2014 could be the year for real, bipartisan agreements in Congress. Call me nave but I still believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together for the greater good. Our democracy was built on people coming together for the common good. Overly partisan politicians with an all or nothing attitude most often get nothing. Let's hope that 2014 can be the year to stop drawing lines in the sand and members of both political parties can work together.
4.
Finally, I hope 2014 can be another winning season for our Mizzou Tigers Football team and we can bring home a win from the Cotton Bowl on January 3rd!
5.
One of biggest differences between Members of Congress is not always the Democrat verses Republican divide. Some of the biggest differences are between rural and urban interests. In 2014 I want to work with other rural representatives to protect our rural way of life. Last year we had some success fighting the EPA and Department of the Interior. In 2014 I hope to build on the past successes to ensure rural Missourians have a seat at the table.
Let&#39;s hope these 5 milestones can be met in 2014. I wish you and your family a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year&#33;
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
