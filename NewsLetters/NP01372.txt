Friend --
Over the last few weeks, we have heard story after story about Chinas provocative actions in the disputed waters of the East and South China Seas.
Many of these actions are being taken by Chinas Coast Guard, which now outnumbers the coast guards of all of Chinas neighbors combined.
At a House Armed Services Committee hearing recently, I asked Admiral Samuel Locklear, Commander of U.S. Pacific Command, what strategies, concepts, forces, and capabilities we need to counter aggression by Chinas paramilitary forces.
While I am fully committed to maintaining U.S. superiority at the high end of the conflict spectrum, I believe it is critically important that we be able to counter and deter this sort of gray zone aggression as well.
You can watch my question and ADM Locklears response
here , or by clicking the image below.
Yours in service,
Randy
