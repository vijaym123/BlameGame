Ukraine
The Ukrainian people-like all people across the globe-deserve to choose
their own government, and determine their own future.
Russia's
escalating intervention in Ukraine is an insult to Ukraine's
sovereignty and to the principles of democracy.
Ukraine and Russia have a complex history
and
tensions have deepened since this past November.
Ukrainian President
Viktor Yanukovych rejected a deal to further ally Ukraine with the
European Union. Since then, Yanukovych's regime has collapsed and
Russian forces have invaded the Ukrainian region of Crimea.
This
threatens the interim government's security and stability.
For an
overview of the Ukrainian crisis, click here
.
President Obama has repeatedly condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine,
and today he authorized expanded sanctions
against Russian officials responsible for the current conflict.
I find
it disturbing that when the United States President speaks out against
Russian action in a sovereign nation, he is largely ignored by Russian
President Vladimir Putin. In fact, the latest news is that despite
President Obama's recent actions, Putin has declared Crimea
to be a separate nation from Ukraine.
The House has passed a series
of
bills
supporting the people of Ukraine and
providing for enhanced economic support.
One challenge for Ukraine is
that they rely almost entirely on Russia for oil and natural gas.
Furthermore, Russia exports $160 billion
in fossil fuels to the EU and U.S., making it difficult
for our allies in Europe to impose the strictest possible sanctions.
One way we can address that is by speeding up the approval of U.S.
exports of liquefied natural gas.
The Administration's slow approval
process essentially prohibits American natural gas exports to Europe
and Ukraine.
I hope we can rectify that quickly, because it's imperative that we do
everything in our power to return democratic control to the people of
Ukraine.
Academy Forums
This Saturday, March 16, marked the 212th anniversary of the founding
of the U.S Military Academy at West Point
.
In the two centuries since West Point was
founded, U.S. military academies have expanded to include the Naval
Academy
, the Air Force Academy
, the Merchant Marine Academy
, and the Coast Guard Academy
.
Students chosen to attend these universities not only receive an
exceptional education, but also the physical, military, and leadership
skills necessary to serve as an officer in the armed forces.
The
application process is competitive, and generally requires a nomination
from a Member of Congress.
Nominating students from the 19th District
to attend a military academy is one of my greatest honors as a
Congressman.
If you or someone you know is interested in a receiving a
great education and serving our country, I encourage you to learn how
you can be nominated to attend one of our country's prestigious
military academies.
I'll be holding an information session in Abilene
on Wednesday, March 19th,
at 6:00 pm at Cisco College, Room 152.
If you can't attend that
session, there will be a second session in Lubbock
on Monday, March 31st at
the Science Spectrum
at 7:00 pm.
I hope to see you there!
District Events
In addition to hosting an Academy Forum this week, I'll also be touring
the Texas Oncology Center
in Abilene.
Later in the week I'll be in Lubbock for the
Southwest Council of Agribusiness Luncheon where I'm looking forward to
discussing the Farm Bill implementation with local farmers.
I'll also
meet with the West Texas Home Builders Association to talk about
housing and insurance reform.
Congressional Art Competition
I'd like to invite all high school artists to participate in this year's
Congressional Art Competition
.
The competition is open to
all high school students in Texas' 19th District, and the lucky winner
will have your original artwork on display in the Capitol Building for
a full year.
I walk through the hallway that displays each district's
winners almost every day that I'm in Washington on my way to vote.
Visitors from across the country who come to tour the Capitol will see
your work too.
It's a beautiful display of America's young artists.
You can learn more about how to submit your work here
, and you can contact Lisa Brooks at
lisa.brooks@mail.house.gov or at (432) 264-0722 with any questions.
Remember, the deadline to submit your work is April 25th.

Ukrainian

Since
then,
Yanukovych&#8217;s

This

I
find
it

in
a
sovereign
nation,
he
is
largely

the
latest
news
is
that
despite
President

declared
Crimea

a
separate

from
Ukraine.
The
