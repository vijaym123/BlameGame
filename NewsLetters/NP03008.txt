Dear Friend,
This week, the Senate began
confirmation hearings for
Loretta Lynch , whom I am proud to
support as our next U.S. Attorney General. She has had a stellar track
record of fighting for justice as a U.S. Attorney in New York. amd I
know she will be an excellent successor to Attorney General Eric
Holder.
I urge the Senate to confirm her as soon as
possible.
This week marked the 6th anniversary of the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, an important step towards achieving equal pay for
women. Though they increasingly serve as the primary breadwinners in
their households,
women still make 77
cents for every dollar a man makes.
Black and Hispanic
women earn only 64 and 55 cents, respectively.
It is clear we
still have some way to go. I will continue to fight to pass the Paycheck
Fairness Act and remain committed to the idea that
when women
succeed, America succeeds.
Retweet if you agree!
Your opinion is valuable to me. So please
visit my website at

information, and to engage with me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's always a great
honor serving you.
Best
regards,
Charles B. Rangel
