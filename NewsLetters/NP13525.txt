Friends,
Can you believe we are only three days away from Christmas?
Wrenzie and I wish you and your loved ones a very Merry and Blessed
Christmas.
I enjoyed being back in the district last week and meeting
with many of you.
Here is a recap of the past
week:
Highlights from Recent Town Hall
Meetings
Thank you to everyone who came to my Aynor and Loris
Town Hall Meetings, both had a great turnout.
At each meeting we
re-capped this legislative year and discussed legislative priorities
for 2014.
ObamaCare, jobs, and economic certainty
were the issues of importance to many of the constituents that
attended.

Loris Town Hall
Meeting)
Guaranteeing the Government Keeps Its Promise to
Retirees
Last week, I cosponsored legislation
( H.R. 3788 ) that would
replace the budget plans reductions to military retiree
benefits
by closing a commonly-abused loophole in the tax code. Our
military retirees and their families have sacrificed so much for our
country; the government should not sacrifice their promised benefit for the
sake of savings.

Unemployment Rate Drops, Closest to National Rate in Years
Good news! South Carolinas unemployment rate is now
7.1 percent, dropping .4 percent from October to November .
While this is a step in the right direction, three counties in our
district still have some of the highest
unemployment
rates in the Palmetto State . As your Representative, I will
continue my efforts to bring new jobs to our area and put more people back
to work.
Recent Partisanship Poll
Results
Each week I send out an instPoll to get
feedback about a current federal issue, upcoming bill, or recent
legislative vote.
Below are the results from one of my recent
instaPoll questions: Has the lack of bipartisanship in Washington hurt
our economy?
Merry Christmas to you
and your loved ones,
