In 2015, women in America still earn less than men for the same work. In our district, it&rsquo;s a SHOCKING 73 cents to the dollar. Sign your name if you agree we&rsquo;ve got to close the pay gap: Supporter:

David --
Six years ago this week, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law.
It was a big step forward, but women STILL earn less than men for the same work. In fact, women in our district earn a shocking 73 cents to every dollar men earn.
That&rsquo;s outrageous. Women should be paid the same for equal work -- period.
1O,OOO STRONG: Sign your name if you believe women deserve equal pay for equal work:

Without equal pay, middle class families have less money to put food on the table, gas in their cars, and even just pay the bills.
It&rsquo;s just not right.
