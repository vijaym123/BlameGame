The Scalise Capitol Report
Monday, July 14,
2014
Defending the
Constitution
President Obama has repeatedly shown his disregard for the
Constitution by failing to faithfully and impartially execute the laws which
he swore to uphold. Even the United States Supreme Court rejected the
president's attempt to write his own laws with last week's Hobby Lobby
ruling.
Rather than attempting to rewrite our nations laws
from the Oval Office, President Obama should put down his pen, and
pick up the Constitution which is crystal clear regarding who writes the
laws. In order to preserve the checks and balances that are integral
to our rich democracy, the House will soon take up
this resolution
authorizing the House to file suit against
President Obama for his failure to faithfully execute the law in violation of
his Constitutional duties. President Obama took an oath to faithfully
execute all the laws of our nation equally, and so did we. This
legislation is an important step in restoring the system of checks and
balances that make our nation
strong.
Reforming our job training programs
Despite
another reduction in the unemployment rate, the share of working-age
Americans holding jobs or looking for work has stalled at a 40-year low. In
the month of June alone, the economy lost 523,000 full-time jobs,
only to be replaced with 700,000 part-time jobs. House Republicans are on
the front lines fighting to counter these staggering statistics by
passing bills that will create jobs and grow our economy. Just last
week, the House passed the Workforce Innovation &amp; Opportunity Act,
legislation that updates the guidelines that give American workers the
training they need when they need it. It would also eliminate
ineffective federal programs and increase transparency in taxpayer spending.
This is one of over 50 House-passed jobs bills that will get America back
to work.
I recently had the opportunity to meet with Frank
Blake, the CEO of Home Depot. As someone who worked at Home Depot to
help pay my way through LSU, Im especially thankful for the nearly
1,200 people they employ in Louisianas First Congressional District and
the more than 4,300 jobs the company has created across
Louisiana.
Conservative
womens roundtable
Last week, I had the opportunity to
host and participate in a panel discussion on the priorities of
American women. The panel featured some of my RSC colleagues and other
leading conservative women. Conservative women have a winning vision for
our country, and the panel demonstrated how effective we can be at
communicating that vision and inspiring all Americans to our values and
principles.
It is an honor to
represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
