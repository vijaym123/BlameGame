Dear Friend,
This week, instead of adopting a bill proposed by Democrats to avoid a
shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and fund it
fully through September30th, Republicans once again played dangerous
political games that would jeopardize our national security.
Meanwhile our country and the brave men and women who keep it safe are held
in limbo as the House GOP plays political games. America cannot
afford more Republican gimmicks
it needs the necessary funding to keep
the American people safe.
With every House Democrat cosponsoring a clean, long-term DHS
funding bill, it is clear this crisis only exists because Republicans
prioritize anti-immigrant extremists over the wellbeing of the American
people.

As the
primary sponsor of the Affordable Care Act, I will, for the next 30 days,
adopt the Rangel Resolution, a 30-day health iniatitive.
The
Rangel Resolution consists of making three easy, healthy, and sustainable
dietary changes. Through this initiative, I also aim to highlight the
need to make healthy food accessible, affordable, and available to
everyone.
Will you join me and adopt
the following healthy habits :
Those interested in
participating in the Rangel Resolution can sign up at
http://rangel.house.gov/rangelres . They will receive a daily
newsletter with updates on my progress and featuring healthy tips
provided by The American Heart Association and The American Diabetes
Association. Everyone who completes the Rangel Resolution and submits a
testimonial about their experience will receive a signed note of
congratulations from me.
The person who submits the best testimonial will
receive a personal phone call. Participants are also encouraged to
submit their healthy recipes; everyone who submits a smoothie or
breakfast recipe will receive the Rangel Resolution Recipe eBook, and the
creator of the best recipe (determined by popular vote) will also receive
personal recognition from me.
On Wednesday, I joined Chris Matthews
on Hardball to talk about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
speech before Congress next month.
Israel
is one of our nation's closest friends
and most important partners . However, the Speaker's gesture is
without precedent and disrespects the authority of the President of
the United States.
You can watch me
here .
Your opinion is valuable to me. So please
visit my website at Rangel.house.gov
for more
information, and to engage with me on
Facebook
and

you.
Best regards,
Charles B.
