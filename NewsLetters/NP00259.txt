Dear Friends,
Two-thirds of retired Americans rely on Social Security for the majority of their income, but so many proposals to shore up its long-term solvency rely on cutting benefits or raising the retirement age. I have a different idea: the
Social Security 2100 Act . This legislation would cut taxes, strengthen benefits, and ensure Social Security remains solvent through the end of the century.
Congressman Larson speaks with seniors in Bloomfield.
Recently,
I shared with
The Hill
my commonsense proposal to protect seniors in the midst of our growing retirement crisis. No one should have to retire into poverty or see their benefits cut when they&rsquo;ve paid into Social Security their whole lives.
Please join me and share your thoughts on this vital program. Refreshments will be provided!
