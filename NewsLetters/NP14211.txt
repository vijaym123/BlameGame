Hardworking Americans shouldnt be forced to foot the bill for free government cell phones. Yet that is exactly what the $9.3 billion Universal Service Fund, one of the governments most bloated and abuse-riddled programs which doubled in size under President Obama, is doing through the FCCs Lifeline program. By saddling your telephone bills with a myriad of taxes and fees,
the government is raising cash to buy these phones at your expense .
That is why I cosponsored
H.R. 176 , the Stop Taxpayer Funded Cell Phones Act, to return the Lifeline program back to its original structure and end federal subsidies for free cell phone services.
The government does not have a duty to provide free cell phones. But it does have an obligation to the American people to use their hard-earned tax dollars in the most efficient, effective way possible.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I will continue to aggressively scrutinize the way taxpayer dollars are spent, and work to cut back waste in duplicative, underutilized, and unnessecary government programs. Read about my specific efforts,
