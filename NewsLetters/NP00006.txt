More than 150 years ago, U.S. Major General Gordon Granger and
his unit of 2,000 Union soldiers embarked on a mission to deliver news
of the Civil Wars end and a reunited nation.
They arrived at
their destination in Galveston, Texas on June 19 th , 1865 and
Maj. Gen. Granger announced the good news to the town: The United
States of America was united once again, and the men, women, and children
who had been enslaved in the South were now free.
This
anniversary has come to be known as Juneteenth, and every year it serves as
a reminder of our mission to build a freer and more equal
society. It is also a fitting opportunity to celebrate the heritage,
identity, and rich contributions African-Americans make to our communities,
our state and our melting pot of a country.
In the 150 years
since this historic announcement and the emancipation of slaves, our
nation has continued to make great strides toward fulfilling the core
principles of the Declaration of Independence
that we are all created
equal and born with the same inherent rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.
Recognition of Juneteenth has steadily
grown over the years. Since Texas became the first state to
recognize Juneteenth as an official holiday in 1980, 43 other states and
Washington, D.C. have followed suit.
This year, I was again
honored to introduce and pass a resolution formally declaring June 19th,
2015, as Juneteenth Independence Day. I also had the privilege
of inviting Friendswood artist Ted Ellis to display his
Juneteenth-inspired artwork in the halls of the U.S. Senate and was able to
participate in this years ceremony at the Ashton Villa in
Galveston.
As we take time today to remember an essential piece of our state and
nations history, I pledge to continue working each and every day to
ensure all Texans can live freer lives for generations to
come.
