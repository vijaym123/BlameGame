Dear friends,
Last week, The Daily Show invited me on the
program to discuss an issue I have worked for years to address:
preventing rapists from pursuing custody and
visitation rights of the children they conceived through
rape.
You may not have known this was even a problem, as Samantha
Bee discovered with what I think is the right amount of outrage, wit
and humor for such a sensitive and serious topic. But each year, by
one studys estimate, up to 32,000 pregnancies result from rape and
about 1/3 of women choose to deliver and raise the child.

Thousands of women
are re-victimized every year when they have to go through this
nightmare, like you just heard in the video from Shauna Prewitt. By changing
the law in every state we can make a difference. My legislation, the
Rape Survivor Child Custody Act, would incentivize states that have not
yet changed their laws to do so.
Outlets around the
country are expressing the disbelief I know you are likely feeling right
now. I hope youll be inspired to take action and contact your state and
Federal lawmakers to help me stop rapists from accessing rights
theyre not entitled to have. Most states need to change their law, though I
am proud that Florida has a strong law on this issue. Please call my
Washington, DC office at 202.225.7931 to check your states status. My
bill encourages states to do the right thing
but they need to hear
from you, their constituents
in order to push them to protect rape
victims.
