Friends,
Last week, millions of Americans tuned in to
hear President Obama deliver his sixth state of the union address and
outline his vision for the country.
For the first time, the
President was addressing a Republican-Controlled Congress and many of us
were hoping he use this opportunity to unify Congress, not divide
it.
Our country is facing serious threats throughout the
world; families have seen their budgets squeezed; college tuition rates
have ballooned.
We need
bold, new solutions for a
21 st
century America .
Solutions that create
opportunities for everyonemore jobs, better wages, viable energy options,
affordable health care, and access to education.
We all
learned at a young age that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
The President took the podium last week and presented some grandiose
solutions like free college.
While that may sound great, we
all know that
nothing is ever free from the federal
government .
Our tax dollars fund ALL government programs and
operations.
The President also made the case for equal pay
for equal work.
I found this ironic because one of
the
key barriers to equal work for equal pay is the seniority
system .
Which employers base their pay scales off of the seniority
system?
The federal government and labor unions.
This
outdated employment model is one reason why I do not support labor unions
and want to reduce bureaucrats salaries.
If the President wants
to double down on equal pay for equal work, he can start in his own
back yard and with his fundraising list.
Lastly, we all
know that you should
never insult an alligator before
crossing the creek .
That is just common sense.
Last
week, the President was boastful throughout his speech.
At one
point, he even insulted Congress saying, I have no more campaigns to
run.
I know because I won both of them.
This is
true.
He does not have any more campaigns to run, but he has a
country to run and quite a few creeks to cross.
Comments like these
only muddy the waters.
Friends, I want to work with
the President to make our tax code fairer and simpler for every
American regardless of his or her income class.
We are not a land of
winners and losers, haves and have nots.
We are the land of the
free, a beacon of opportunity, and home of the brave.
I hope the
President can change his approach to Congress and work
with us
to improve the lives of all Americans , without driving up
dates and dividing the country.

the State of the Union, and me finding our seats for the speech and on

Reviewing Federal Regulators
&amp; Regulations
The Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, of which I am a member, held a hearing last week to
examine the Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) aircraft flight
standards and regulations.
I fully support FAA regulations that
keep passengers and cargo safe.
Our nation has been a leader
in aeronautics and we will only continue to be the best if we
maintain our high safety standards.
The purpose of this hearing was to
ensure that these regulations have not grown
frivolous
and the certification process is streamlined.
All too
often, these processes are a bureaucratic maze.
During the
hearing,
a witness from Boeing
pointed out that
the FAA is involved in decisions like aircraft seats, lavatories, and
galleys.
I found this to be alarming.
My colleagues
and I will continue to pressure the FAA to streamline their
certification process so our American aviation companies, like Boeing, can
remain world-wide industry leaders.
Recently Cosponsored
Legislation
This week I cosponsored quite
a few bills that you may find interesting.
These bills would
make our country more secure and scale back the size of our federal
government.
Illegal Entry Accountability Act of 2015-
stops U.S. foreign aid for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico
until they have taken sufficient measures to stop unaccompanied
children from illegally crossing our southern border.
Email
Privacy Act- updates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
and requires the government to get a warrant based on probable cause
to access emails regardless of their age or
status.
Default Prevention Act- prioritizes our country spending obligations so we
do not default on our debt.
Should you hear of
legislation you would like for me to cosponsor or have a legislative idea
you want me to introduce, please contact my Washington DC office at
202-225-9895.
I am here to act as your voice in Congress; help me
be your voice!
It is an honor and privilege to
serve you and your family.
Have a good
week,
