Dear
Friend,
U.S. REP MEEKS HOUSE FLOOR REMARKS DEMANDING
ANSWERS ON FAILURE TO PREVENT INCREASING FLOOD INSURANCE
PREMIUMS
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Today, Congressman Gregory W. Meeks
(NY-05) spoke on the House floor about the real economic impact that
failing to pass comprehensive flood insurance reforms is having on families
in the Jamaica Bay, Rockaway Peninsula, and across the
nation.
Last weeks passage of S. 1926 by the Senate adds new
momentum for the House to take action that would delay increases to flood
insurance premiums.
Pressure from homeowners and members on both
sides of aisles in the House has increased since last weeks vote in
the Senate.
Rather than addressing this matter, House Republicans
are bringing partisan bills with no chance of actually becoming law
to the floor for a vote.
In response,
Congressman Meeks took to the House floor and demanded answers from his
Republican colleagues:
Why is
the House delaying legislation that provides such essential
relief?
When will the House leadership put politics aside? And when will
they do the right thing for struggling American families who truly need
this bipartisan bill that provides meaningful relief and hope to
thousands of struggling homeowners in flood affected zones?
It
is time we hear the voices of hundreds of thousands of our fellow
citizens who have been devastated by the botched implementation of the
Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act that led to dramatic increases in the
cost of flood insurance.
It is time that we on this side of
the capitol take up this legislation and address this problem before
one more family suffers from increased premiums, depressed home
prices, or the inability to sell their home.
It is time for the
most extreme wing of the Republican Party to stop blocking real relief
for our nations homeowners and pass this important reform today.
