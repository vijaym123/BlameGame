Happy Mother's Day!
On Mother's Day, we honor those selfless, indomitable women who have
helped make us into the people we are today. My mother, Sabra, has
always been an inspiration for me. She taught me and my siblings the
importance of determination and hard work. She instilled values of
equality and justice in me early in my life -values that I still carry
with me in my work today. She was the first person to teach me to
always stand up for what I believe in and to fight for the things that
matter. Most of all, she taught me about my responsibility to make the
world a better place.
And she did all of this while providing
unconditional love and support. Thanks, Mom.
On this Mother's Day, we should also particularly honor all the brave
mothers serving across the world as members of the United States Armed
Forces. Their sacrifices and those of their families must never be
forgotten.
Finally, I hope you will also keep the 276 Nigerian students abducted
by the terrorist group, Boko Haram, in Nigeria in your prayers. These
courageous girls dared to dream of a better life for themselves by
pursuing an education. This will be a very difficult Mother's Day for
them and their families and I hope you will keep them in your thoughts.
Let's be sure these girls know we have not forgotten them and that we
will do all we can to be sure they are safely returned home.
Enjoy this day with your family and friends.
Warm regards,
David Cicilline

Happy
Mother's
Day!
On
Mother's
Day,
we
honor
those
selfless,
indomitable
women
who
have
helped
make
us
into
the
people
we
are
today. My
mother,
Sabra,
has
always
been
an
inspiration
for
me.
She
taught
me
and
my
siblings
the
importance
of determination and
hard
work. She
instilled
values
of
equality
and
justice
in
me
early
in
my
life
&#8212;values
that
I
still
carry
with
me
in
my
work
today.
She
was
the
first
person
to
teach
me
to
always
stand
up
for
what
I
believe
in
and
to
fight
for
the
things
that
matter. Most
of
all,
she
taught
me
about
my responsibility
to
make
the
world
a
better
place.
And
she
did
all
of
this
while
providing unconditional
love
and
support.
Thanks,
Mom.
On
this
Mother's
Day,
we
should
also
particularly
honor
all
the
brave
mothers
serving
across
the
world
as
members
of
the
United
States
Armed
Forces. Their
sacrifices
and
those
of
their

must
never
be

Finally,
I
hope
you
will
also
keep
the
276
Nigerian
students
abducted
by
the
terrorist
group,
Boko
Haram,
in
Nigeria
in
your
prayers. These
courageous
girls
dared
to
dream
of
a
better
life
for
themselves
by
pursuing
an
education.
This
will
be
a
very
difficult
Mother's
Day
for
them
and
their
families
and
I
hope
you
will
keep
them
in
your
thoughts. Let's
be
sure
these
girls
know
we
have
not forgotten them
and
that
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
be
sure they are
safely
returned
home.
Enjoy
this
day
with
your
family
and
friends.
