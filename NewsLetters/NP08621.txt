For many students in Florida's 25th congressional district, the months
of May and June are the start to the beginning of summer and a few
weeks off from their academic studies. But for others, it is beginning
of a new chapter in their lives, marked by their graduation.
This year, I was honored to be the keynote speaker at the graduation
ceremonies of Mater Lakes Academy High School and City of Hialeah
Educational Academy. I celebrated their achievements, the sacrifices
made by them and their families, and spoke about the meaning of
success. We use the word success often in our day-to-day lives, but do
we understand what the true meaning of success is? This poem, written
by Ralph Waldo Emerson, was quite fitting for the occasion:
To laugh often and much;
To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children.
To earn the appreciation of honest critics and to endure the betrayal
of false friends.
To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others.
To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch, or a redeemed social condition.
To know even one life has breathed easier, because you have lived.
That is to have succeeded.
I wish the students all over Florida's 25th congressional district the
best as they close one chapter in their lives and begin another. They,
along with their families, friends, and teachers, have worked hard to
get them to where they are today. Now, it is up to the students to do
their part. It is up to them to continue to succeed.

For
many
students
in
Florida&#8217;s
25th
congressional
district,
the
months
of
May
and
June
are
the
start
to
the
beginning
of
summer
and
a
few
weeks
off
from
their
academic
studies.
But
for
others,
it
is
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
in
their
lives,
marked
by
their
graduation.
This
year,
I
was
honored
to
be
the
keynote
speaker
at
the
graduation
ceremonies
of
Mater
Lakes
Academy
High
School
and
City
of
Hialeah
Educational
Academy.
I
celebrated
their
achievements,
the
sacrifices
made
by
them
and
their
families,
and
spoke
about
the
meaning
of
success.
We
use
the
word
success
often
in
our
day-to-day
lives,
but
do
we
understand
what
the
true
meaning
of
success
is?
This
poem,
written
by
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson,
was
quite
fitting
for
the
occasion:
To
laugh
often
and
much;
To
win
the
respect
of
intelligent
people
and
the
affection
of
children.
To
earn
the
appreciation
of
honest
critics
and
to
endure
the
betrayal
of
false
friends.
To
appreciate
beauty,
to
find
the
best
in
others.
To
leave
the
world
a
bit
better,
whether
by
a
healthy
child,
a
garden
patch,
or
a
redeemed
social
condition. To
know
even
one
life
has
breathed
easier,
because
you
have
lived.
That
is
to
have
succeeded.
I
wish
the
students
all
over
Florida&#8217;s
25th
congressional
district
the
best
as
they
close
one
chapter
in
their
lives
and
begin
another.
They,
along
with
their
families,
friends,
and
teachers,
have
worked
hard
to
get
them
to
where
they
are
today.
Now,
it
is
up
to
the
students
to
do
their
part.
It
is
up
to
them
to
continue
to
succeed.
