Dear
Friends:
President Ronald Reagan said, Perhaps no custom
reveals our character as a Nation so clearly as our celebration of
Thanksgiving Day. Thanksgiving is a time to be spent with our friends,
family members and loved ones. We all have hardships and misfortunes in our
lives, but Thanksgiving is a time to recount all of our blessings,
remember all that we have, and to recognize and give back to those less
fortunate. We are all very blessed to live in a free and democratic
country whose values represent the very meaning of the Thanksgiving
holiday.
In 1789, the first presidential proclamation
was issued by George Washington when he designated November 26th as a
day of national prayer and thanksgiving to God. The chief aim was to
give thanks to God for affording them an opportunity peaceably to
establish a form of government for their safety and happiness. As a
Cuban-American, I know firsthand what it means to live under a regime that
oppresses its people and denies their choices and freedoms. The United
States was founded on the belief that each person is granted certain
unalienable rights: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. The freedom of different viewpoints, faiths and opinions is
seen as evidence of the strength of our
democracy.
Regardless of how you celebrate this holiday, remember that our country
was made great by men and women of humble origins and modest means,
many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedoms we enjoy today.
Let us remember those brave men and women who cannot be with their
families while serving our country away from home. As the wife of a
Vietnam combat veteran and stepmother to two Marine aviators, I am aware
of the sacrifices that military families make. Let us remember those
less fortunate and think of ways we can donate, volunteer and give back
to our South Florida community.
As a wife, mother,
grandmother and Member of Congress, I take on many roles. As I look
back on a busy year, I find myself most thankful and honored to continue
to serve my family and our community. All too often, we get caught up
in our busy schedules and forget what is truly important to us.
During this holiday season, I encourage everyone to take the time to
appreciate those you love and share your stories of thanks. I wish you and
your family good health, happiness and all the best.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
