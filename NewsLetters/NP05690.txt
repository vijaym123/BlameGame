Rep. Miller on 2014 Nobel Peace Prize Recipients
Harrison Township, MI &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement on the announcement that Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan and Kailash Satyarthi of India are this year&#8217;s recipients of the Nobel Peace
Prize:
&#8220; In this dangerous world, where there are far too many examples of inhumanity, it is appropriate today that the Nobel Peace Prize Committee gave this annual award to two individuals who represent the best of
humanity.
&#8220;Malala Yousafzai is a 17-year-old Pakistani young woman who, two years ago, was shot in the head by the Taliban for simply stating that girls have the right to an education.
Most would have not had the courage and strength to fight
back against such atrocities, but Malala did fight back and has become a positive leading voice in the world for the rights of young women.
It is totally appropriate that, today, Malala was informed of this great honor while attending school in Birmingham,
England.
&#8220;Kailash Satyarthi, who shares this prize with Malala, was a businessman and electrical engineer in India who gave up his career to become an activist leader in the effort to end child slavery and the exploitation of children.
Because
of his efforts, tens of thousands of children have been rescued from slavery and given a chance to live their lives.
&#8220;I applaud the Nobel Committee for choosing a young woman and a 60-year-old man who are both tireless and undaunted advocates for dignity, humanity and the value of every child.
These two individuals have truly been examples that should
be highlighted, and their message must be heard.&#8221;
