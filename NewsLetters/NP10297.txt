Statement on Secretary Kerry's
Recent Comments on Israel
4/29/14
Recently,
Secretary of State John Kerry caused consternation in Israel by stating that
Israel could become an "apartheid state" if the latest round of
Israel-Palestine peace talks fail.
"To imply in any way that the Israelis are the ones blocking our
progress to peace in the Middle East is to have a profoundly wrong and
one-sided view of affairs. It is imperative that American diplomats
evaluate these negotiations from a position of honesty. In order to
achieve a lasting peace, Palestinian officials must not condone, side with,
or encourage the activities of terrorist organizations like Hamas."
"Secretary of State
John Kerry can't resist putting his foot in his mouth as he practices
his particular brand of diplomacy. After his many years in the Senate
and as Secretary of State, Kerry should know that his odious
suggestion that Israel risks becoming an apartheid state is both historically
unjust and deeply offensive. His retraction last night was the very
least he could do."
