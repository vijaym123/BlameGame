Making the commitment to our veterans
With Veterans Day approaching, its vital that Congress affirms its commitment to improving support for those who have served in our military. That includes
cleaning up the inefficiencies
within the VA and
bringing health care access closer to our rural veterans.
Earlier this year, I had the privilege of joining my colleagues from the Congressional Caucus on Womens Issues at the Marine Corps Sunset Parade in Washington, DC.
