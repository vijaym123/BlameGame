Dear Friend,
I am excited to report that a bipartisan delegation letter that I led
has resulted in Arizona receiving additional resources at our border.
While this is a step in the right direction, I will continue to fight
for more resources at our Arizona-Mexico border so we protect our
state, grow our economy and increase Arizona jobs.
The Arizona Republic recently highlighted our success in the article
below.
Sincerely,
Our View: House delegation works together, gets start on needed ports
staffing increase
Arizona can celebrate a big win along the border. The credit goes to
the state's U.S. House delegation. Last month, eight members signed a
letter seeking additional Customs' officers at the ports of entry.
They asked for 500 new officers, which is what Arizona needs.
They got 170. Well, it's a start. It will help.
Federal improvements to the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales produced
a vastly expanded facility that has to be properly staffed to be
useful. Closed lanes and limited operating hours don't cut it.
What's at stake is national security (smugglers increasingly use ports)
as well as Arizona's ability to grow its trade relationship with
Mexico. Texas is actively competing to divert the Mexican produce that
has long come through Arizona borders. Arizona has to be competitive.
Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the
Americas, says the Mariposa port alone needs 250 additional Customs
officers. Yet the federal commitment to boost staffing in our state is
a "great step in the right direction," he says.
What's also impressive is that our House delegation worked across party
lines to make this happen. Republican Rep. Matt Salmon took the lead on
the letter to the Department of Homeland Security. It was signed by
fellow Republicans Trent Franks, David Schweikert and Paul Gosar.
Democrats signing were Kyrsten Sinema, Ron Barber, Raul Grijalva and
Anne Kirkpatrick.
But this was just a start. The delegation needs to continue working
together to help Arizona build trade infrastructure so it can reap the
commercial potential of its international border.

Dear
Friend,
I
am
excited
to
report
that
a
bipartisan
delegation
letter
that
I
led
has
resulted
in
Arizona
receiving
additional
resources
at
our

While
this
is
a
step
in
the
right

I
will
continue
to
fight
for
more
resources
at
our
Arizona-Mexico
border
so
we
protect
our
state,
grow
our
economy
and
increase
Arizona
jobs.
The
Arizona
Republic
recently
highlighted
our
success
in
the
article
below.
Sincerely,
Our
View:
House
delegation
works
together,
gets
start
on
needed
ports
staffing
increase
Arizona
can
celebrate
a
big
win
along
the
border.
The
credit
goes
to
the
state's
U.S.
House
delegation.
Last
month,
eight
members
signed
a
letter
seeking
additional
Customs'

at
the
ports
of
entry.
They
asked
for
500
new
officers,
which
is
what
Arizona
needs.
They
got
170.
Well,
it's
a
start.
It
will
help.
Federal
improvements
to
the
Mariposa
Port
of
Entry
in
Nogales
produced
a
vastly
expanded
facility
that
has
to
be

Closed

and
limited

What's

is
national
security
(smugglers

as

as
Arizona's

Texas

Arizona

Lance

says
the
Mariposa

alone
needs
250
additional
Customs
officers.
Yet
the
federal
commitment
to
boost
staffing
in
our
state
is
a
"great
step
in
the
right
direction,"
he
says.
What's
also
impressive
is
that
our
House
delegation
worked
across
party
lines
to
make
this
happen.
Republican
Rep.
Matt
Salmon
took
the
lead
on
the
letter
to
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security.
It
was
signed
by
fellow
Republicans
Trent
Franks,
David
Schweikert
and
Paul
Gosar.
Democrats
signing
were
Kyrsten
Sinema,
Ron
Barber,
Raul
Grijalva
and
Anne
Kirkpatrick.
But
this
was
just
a
start.
The
delegation
needs
to
continue
working
together
to
help
Arizona
build
trade
infrastructure
so
it
can
reap
the
commercial
potential
of
its
international
border.
