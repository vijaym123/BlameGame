Doug Lamborn has joined dozens of his colleagues in the U.S. House
calling on the House Appropriations Committee to, "include language in all
relevant appropriations legislation for FY 2015 to prohibit the use of
funds by the administration for the implementation of current or
future executive actons that would create additional work permits and
green cards outside the scope prescribed by
Congress."
