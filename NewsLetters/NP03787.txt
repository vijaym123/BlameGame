Dear Neighbor,
I always look forward to spending the holiday season with my lovely wife, sons and our family. Merry Christmas, from my family to yours. I hope you welcome the new year with health and happiness.
Please click here, or the photo below, for a video message.
During this holiday season, I wish to take a moment and recognize some of the blessings for which I am very thankful. Id like to thank our Armed Forces serving throughout the world. They are sacrificing their time which could be spent with their loved ones while instead, they are defending freedom for all Americans. May the Lord guide and guard our troops on their many important missions. I also remain grateful for our nations veterans who have served with valor and distinction protecting the greatest nation on earth.
As 2014 comes to an end, I am incredibly honored to serve you in the United States Congress. My goals for the next Congress are to provide positive solutions that empower Florida families to realize their greatest God given potential. I will continue to work to create a vibrant business community and encourage strong economic growth that will create long-term high paying jobs.
It is a privilege to represent you. Please, continue to write and call my office so I can best represent your voice in Washington.
Have a Merry Christmas, a happy holiday season and a blessed 2015 and beyond.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
