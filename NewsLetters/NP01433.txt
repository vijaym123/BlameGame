Senator Stabenow Talks Craft Brew Economy at Inaugural Great Lakes
Hops and Barley Conference
Senator Stabenow, Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, delivered opening remarks during
the Inaugural Great Lakes Hop & Barley Conference held in Grand Rapids
on April 10. The conference, which was hosted by the Michigan Brewers
Guild, MSU Extension and MSU AgBio Research, featured sessions designed
to help growers, processors and brewers learn how to better grow and
market their products in Michigan. The craft brewing industry supports
thousands of jobs and contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to
Michigan's economy each year. Stabenow's 2014 Farm Bill strengthens
support for local food systems and the production of crops like hops
and barley. The farm bill also supports access to resources for
research, marketing and pest and disease prevention.

Stabenow Introduces Resolution Stating Opposition To Storage of Nuclear
Waste in Great Lakes Basin
Senator Stabenow introduced a Senate resolution, along with Senator
Peters, urging the administration to oppose a Canadian proposal to
build a permanent nuclear waste repository in the Great Lakes Basin.
Ontario Power Generation has proposed to build a permanent repository
for nuclear waste less than a mile from Lake Huron in Kincardine,
Ontario. This close proximity to the lake could be disastrous if an
accidental spill were ever to occur. Over 40 million people in Canada
and the United States get their drinking water from the Great Lakes and
the highly toxic waste could take tens of thousands of years to
decompose to safe levels.
"Canada's proposed nuclear waste dump on the
shores of Lake Huron puts our Great Lakes at risk of radioactive
contamination that could have devastating consequences for future
generations," said
Stabenow. "I have expressed my strong objections to
the Canadian government directly, and today's resolution puts
additional pressure on the Canadians to stop this plan," she added.
