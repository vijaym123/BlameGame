Congressman Lamborn Receives Award for Conservative
Excellence
5/14/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn has been presented with the
Award for Conservative Excellence by the American Conservative Union. He
is the only member of the Colorado Congressional delegation to be
recognized by the ACU. Congressman Lamborn's 96% rating (98% Lifetime
Rating) is well above the average nationwide Republican average of 76%
and places him in the Top 14 of all members of the
House.
"I am humbled and appreciative to
receive this prestigious award from the American Conservative Union. They
are a strong force advocating for conservative principles all over the
country. This recognition is yet another concrete example of my
rock-solid dedication to the conservative values we hold dear. People have
tried to convince me to compromise on my bedrock beliefs, but I will
never sacrifice my principles for political
expediency."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
