Dear Friend,
In this edition of my video mailbox, I will update you on two important issues
our nation's security and government regulations.
Last week the House Armed Services Committee approved the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4435) to allocate funding for our troops and other national security priorities.
Specifically, the bill would authorize $521.3 billion for the Department of Defense and the nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy, plus $79.4 billion for the war in Afghanistan and other overseas operations.
When any of us turn on the news, we can see that the threats to our security are growing and getting more complex all around the world.
This strong, bipartisan bill tries to meet these threats within a constrained budget and helps lay the groundwork for our efforts to get more defense for our dollars in the years to come.
The brave men and women who fight for our freedom deserve to have the resources they need to keep our people safe and our nation strong.
Locally, the defense policy bill authorizes funding for programs at Sheppard Air Force Base, Bell Helicopter, and Pantex.
Here are some of the highlights:
Bell Helicopter projects funded at $1.845 billion for the V-22 Osprey program, including 19 new aircraft, and $904 million for the Huey and Cobra (UH-1Y/AH-1Z) helicopters, including 26 new H-1 series helicopters.
Bill increases funding for nuclear weapons activitiesmuch of which is performed at Pantexby $143.7 million.
Increases funding for recapitalizing deferred maintenance programs by $39 million to help address the backlog of deferred maintenance on physical infrastructure in the nuclear weapons facilities, including Pantex.
The defense policy bill is expected to be considered by the full House before Memorial Day.

Much of our country's potential for economic growth and progress is hindered by overbearing federal regulations.
More regulations do not produce a better quality of life for Americans, but actually the reverse.
Federal regulations make it harder for business to keep their doors open, stunting the growth our economy needs.
In addition, our farmers and ranchers should never have to worry about the federal government infringing upon their personal property or harming industries vital to their livelihoods, like the oil and gas industry and coal industry for example.
Tune in to my video mailbox to hear more about our efforts to combat overbearing regulations and build a better, safer, and stronger America.
