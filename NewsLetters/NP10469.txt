On the Road in the Granite State
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a fantastic weekend. I spent last week visiting
businesses and schools throughout the Second District. In Nashua, I
unveiled my Women's Economic Agenda to help level the playing field for
New Hampshire women. My new Economic Agenda includes initiatives to
address the wage gap between genders, the importance of a fair minimum
wage, tax relief for working families, efforts to better support women
entrepreneurs, the urgent need to invest in the education of our
children from early-childhood through college, the need for women's
comprehensive reproductive health care, and the importance of job
training and workforce development, among other issues. I am committed
to continuing to work on behalf of Granite State women!
Unveiling my Women's Economic Agenda
On Tuesday, I was joined by a diverse group of female business owners
and other women to unveil my Women's Economic Agenda in Nashua. These
women shared their personal stories with me, and underscored the need
for leadership in Congress on issues that affect their ability to
succeed in this economy. Tuesday's event kicked off a series of
roundtable discussions I will hold to hear from women throughout the
Second District in April.
It is astonishing that even in the 21st Century, women continue to make
only 77 cents for every dollar made by their male counterparts. We must
prioritize initiatives that will help eliminate the wage gap between
genders and encourage women to pursue successful careers during these
challenging economic times.
At W.S. Badger in Gilsum
Touring a Socially Responsible Small Business in Gilsum
On Thursday, I toured W.S. Badger in Gilsum and heard from employees
about the company's family-friendly work philosophy. I applaud W.S.
Badger for embracing a worker friendly and family friendly philosophy,
which is essential to the success, health, and happiness of New
Hampshire workers. I was particularly impressed by the company's 'Babies
at Work' program, which allows working mothers and fathers to spend
valuable time with their children during the work hours. Every company
should strive to embrace programs that help our families succeed, and
I'm proud to support initiatives like this one in my recently announced
Women's Economic Agenda.
Exciting Work at New England Wire
On Friday, as part of my "Congress at Your Company" tour, I toured New
England Wire in Lisbon and heard from owners and employees about what
Congress can do to help small businesses like theirs succeed. During
the tour, I also highlighted my Jobs and Opportunity Agenda, a
common-sense guide to help grow the New Hampshire economy.
It was a pleasure meeting with the owners and employees of New England
Wire, an employee-owned New Hampshire company that is clearly going big
places. This is a company that has truly embraced the New Hampshire
spirit of innovation, and I was very impressed by what I saw on my tour
of the facilities. We must continue to support the growth of businesses
like this one, which is why I will continue to push to make the
Research and Development Tax Credit permanent, and continue to advocate
for other measures in Congress that foster innovation here at home.
A Step Forward for Vets Health in the North Country
I was absolutely thrilled at last week's announcement that the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to open new health clinics in
Colebrook and Berlin to better serve North Country veterans. In the
113th Congress, I have urged the VA to open these sites and improve
accessibility for North Country veterans, most recently by sending a
letter to VA Secretary Eric Shinseki
outlining the need for these
facilities.
The new clinics, which have been approved by the VA as
part of an expansion plan for the White River Junction VA Medical
Center, will offer a number of crucial health services for North
Country veterans, including preventive and primary care, labs, and
telehealth services. Our veterans have made extreme sacrifices to serve
and protect this great nation, and we must ensure they have access to
the health care services they need and deserve when they return home.
With students at Shaker Road School
Discussing Financial Literacy with the Next Generation of Leaders
I also visited Shaker Road school to take questions from students
participating in the Stock Market Game: 2014 Capitol Hill Challenge.
During the visit, I heard from the students about their projects, and
discussed the importance of encouraging financial literacy among our
younger generation. I was so impressed by the Shaker Road students,
whose thoughtful, intelligent questions demonstrated their thorough
understanding of the stock market and finance in general. Children like
these are our nation's future leaders, and promoting financial literacy
among this age group will help protect our nation's economic security
down the road. I was honored to get a chance to hear from these
inspiring students, and I wish the competing teams all the best of
luck!
Touring the I-93 expansion project
Promoting Infrastructure Funding
During a tour of the I-93 expansion project in New Hampshire's southern
tier, I called for increased federal investment in our roads and
bridges. I was joined by New Hampshire Department of Transportation
Commissioner Chris Clement, along with State Senator Jim Rausch and
State Representative Candace Bouchard, the chairs of the New Hampshire
State Senate and House Transportation Committees. On the tour, I
stressed the importance of continued funding for infrastructure
projects like this one.
Last month, I wrote a letter
to House Leadership urging that
funding for the Highway Trust Fund, which funds projects like the I-93
expansion, not be allowed to run out. As it stands today, the Highway
Trust Fund is scheduled to drop below a critical funding threshold by
June of this year, which could delay payments to states for vital
infrastructure repair projects.
We must make repairing our roads and
bridges a top priority. Projects like the I-93 expansion not only help
protect the safety of Granite State residents, they also provide better
transportation options for our state's workers, spur the economy, and
create jobs.
Have a terrific week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

On
the
Road
in
the
Granite
State
Hi
Everyone!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
fantastic
weekend. I
spent
last
week
visiting
businesses
and
schools
throughout
the
Second
District. In
Nashua,
I
unveiled
my
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda
to
help
level
the
playing
field
for
New
Hampshire
women.
My
new
Economic
Agenda
includes
initiatives
to
address
the
wage
gap
between
genders,
the
importance
of
a
fair
minimum
wage,
tax
relief
for
working
families,
efforts
to
better
support
women
entrepreneurs,
the
urgent
need
to
invest
in
the
education
of
our
children
from
early-childhood
through
college,
the
need
for
women&#8217;s
comprehensive
reproductive
health
care,
and
the
importance
of
job
training
and
workforce
development,
among
other
issues . I
am
committed
to
continuing
to
work
on
behalf
of
Granite
State
women!
Unveiling
my
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda
On
Tuesday,
I
was
joined
by
a
diverse
group
of
female
business
owners
and
other
women
to
unveil
my
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda
in
Nashua.
These
women
shared
their
personal
stories
with
me,
and
underscored
the
need
for
leadership
in
Congress
on
issues
that
affect
their
ability
to
succeed
in
this
economy.
Tuesday&#8217;s
event
kicked
off
a
series
of
roundtable
discussions
I
will
hold
to
hear
from
women
throughout
the
Second
District
in
April.
It
is
astonishing
that
even
in
the
21 st
Century,
women
continue
to
make
only
77
cents
for
every
dollar
made
by
their
male
counterparts.
We
must
prioritize
initiatives
that
will
help
eliminate
the
wage
gap
between
genders
and
encourage
women
to
pursue
successful
careers
during
these
challenging
economic
times .
At
W.S.
Badger
in
Gilsum Touring
a
Socially
Responsible
Small
Business
in
Gilsum
On
Thursday,
I
toured
W.S.
Badger
in
Gilsum
and
heard
from
employees
about
the
company&#8217;s
family-friendly
work
philosophy. I
applaud
W.S.
Badger
for
embracing
a
worker
friendly
and
family
friendly
philosophy,
which
is
essential
to
the
success,
health,
and
happiness
of
New
Hampshire
workers. I
was particularly
impressed
by
the
company&#8217;s
&#8216;Babies
at
Work&#8217;
program,
which
allows
working
mothers
and
fathers
to
spend
valuable
time
with
their
children
during
the
work
hours.
Every
company
should
strive
to
embrace
programs
that
help
our
families
succeed,
and
I&#8217;m
proud
to
support
initiatives
like
this
one
in
my
recently
announced
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda.
Exciting
Work
at
New
England
Wire
On
Friday,
as
part
of
my
&#8220;Congress
at
Your
Company&#8221;
tour,
I
toured
New
England
Wire
in
Lisbon
and
heard
from
owners
and
employees
about
what
Congress
can
do
to
help
small
businesses
like
theirs
succeed.
During
the
tour,
I
also
highlighted
my
Jobs

a

of
New

an

This
is
a
company
that
has
truly
embraced
the
New
Hampshire
spirit
of
innovation,
and
I
was
very
impressed
by
what
I
saw
on
my
tour
of
the
facilities.
We
must
continue
to
support
the
growth
of
businesses
like
this
one,
which
is
why
I
will
continue
to
push
to
make
the
Research
and
Development
Tax
Credit
permanent,
and
continue
to
advocate
for
other
measures
in
Congress
that
foster

here

A
Step

for
Vets
Health
in

I
was
absolutely
thrilled
at
last

announcement
that the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
plans to
open
new
health

In

I
have

for
North

veterans,
most
recently
by
sending
a

The

veterans
have
made
extreme

protect
this

and
we
must
ensure
they
have
access
to
the
health

services
they
need
and
deserve
when
they
return
home.
With
students
at
Shaker
Road
School
Discussing
Financial
Literacy
with
the
Next
Generation
of
Leaders
I
also
visited
Shaker
Road
school
to
take
questions
from
students
participating
in
the
Stock
Market
Game:
2014
Capitol
Hill
Challenge.
During
the
visit,
I
heard
from
the
students
about
their
projects,
and
discussed
the
importance
of
encouraging
financial
literacy
among
our
younger
generation. I
was
so
impressed
by
the
Shaker
Road
students,
whose
thoughtful,
intelligent
questions
demonstrated
their
thorough
understanding
of
the
stock
market
and
finance
in
general. Children
like
these
are
our
nation&#8217;s
future
leaders,
and
promoting
financial
literacy
among
this
age
group
will
help
protect
our
nation&#8217;s
economic
security
down
the
road.
I
was
honored
to
get
a
chance
to
hear
from
these
inspiring
students,
and
I
wish
the
competing
teams
all
the
best
of
luck!
Touring
the
I-93
expansion
project Promoting
Infrastructure
Funding
During
a
tour
of
the
I-93
expansion
project
in
New
Hampshire&#8217;s
southern
tier,
I
called
for
increased
federal
investment
in
our
roads
and
bridges.
I
was
joined
by
New
Hampshire
Department
of
Transportation
Commissioner
Chris
Clement,
along
with
State
Senator
Jim
Rausch
and
State
Representative
Candace
Bouchard,
the
chairs
of
the
New
Hampshire
State
Senate
and
House
Transportation
Committees.
On
the
tour,
I
stressed
the
importance
of
continued
funding
for
infrastructure
projects
like
this
one.
Last
month,
I
wrote
a
letter
to
House
Leadership
urging
that
funding
for
the
Highway
Trust
Fund,
which
funds
projects
like
the
I-93
expansion,
not
be
allowed
to
run
out.
As
it
stands
today,
the
Highway
Trust
Fund
is
scheduled
to
drop
below
a
critical
funding
threshold
by
June
of
this
year,
which
could
delay
payments
to
states
for
vital
infrastructure
repair
projects.
We
must
make
repairing
our
roads
and
bridges
a
top
priority.
Projects
like
the
I-93
expansion
not
only
help
protect
the
safety
of
Granite
State
residents,
they
also
provide
better
transportation
options
for
our
state&#8217;s
workers,
spur
the
economy,
and
create
jobs.
Have
a
terrific
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you
do
to
make
New
Hampshire
such
a
great
place
to
live!
