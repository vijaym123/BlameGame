Dear
Friend,
I hope this finds you
well. I wanted to give you a quick update on some of the issues I have
been working on over the past month.
The Wisconsin
Idea
Last week, along with Reps. Pocan and Moore, I
introduced a resolution to protect and commemorate the Wisconsin Idea as a
fundamental part of the University of Wisconsin System, which has been
part of the fabric of our state for over 100 years. Over the years the
Wisconsin Idea has been the foundation for hundreds of thousands of
Wisconsinites' education. Wisconsins universities have been guided by the
idea that their mission is to help foster students growth both
inside and outside the classroom. My resolution encourages the protection
of the Wisconsin Idea for generations to
come.
Tomah
VA
Recently I spoke with VA Under Secretary for Health Dr.
Carolyn Clancy and Tomah VA Acting Director John Rohrer to get an update
on the 30-day Plan at the Tomah VA. You can find more information
about the plan
here.
I was encouraged by my
conversation with Dr. Clancy and Acting Director Rohrer. The progress on the
30-day plan and the beginning of training for pain management are
promising steps in the right direction, but the VA still has a ways to go.
Check out the video below.
Working Together
I was
proud to recently be ranked as the most bipartisan member of the
Wisconsin delegation and 18th overall when compared to all 435 Member of
Congress. A recent editorial in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
highlighted The Lugar Center's Bipartisan Index, which measures how often each
Member of Congress works accross party
lines.
As always, please do not hesitate to be in touch with
comments or questions. I also encourage you to visit my website,
www.kind.house.gov , where you can find updated
information, sign up to receive my electronic newsletter, and send me
e-mail.
Sincerely,
I want to hear from you! Do you support the Wisconsin
Idea? Yes No *By answering this
