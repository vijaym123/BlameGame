Dear
Friend,
In September, House Republicans
continued to waste time and taxpayer dollars by voting for the
53rd time to undermine or repeal the consumer protections, financial
assistance, and expanded coverage options provided by the Affordable Care Act.
With the open enrollment season for 2015 having started last weekend,
heres a look at how the Affordable Care Act provides important
patient protections and health care benefits to American families, a
majority of whom would like to see the law improved, not
repealed:
129 million Americans, including 17.6 million children with
pre-existing conditions, cannot be discriminated against by insurers,
and being a woman can no longer be considered a pre-existing
condition.[HHS,
7/16/14 ]
Over 10 million
previously uninsured adults have found coverage, cutting the uninsured
rate by 26%. [HHS,
10/7/14 ]
Approximately 6 million young adults, many of whom would otherwise be
uninsured, have been allowed to stay on their parents private insurance
plans until age 26. [Ways and Means,
11/12/14 ]
100 million Americans with private insurance no longer
need to worry about hitting a lifetime limit on coverage. [HHS,
7/16/14 ]
For the 2014 coverage year,
88% of Louisiana residents who signed up for private health insurance
received financial assistance, and their average monthly premium
after subsidies was $83 with 45% paying $50 or less. [HHS,
6/18/14 ]
76 million Americans with private
insurance have received free preventive care services, including 30 million
women and 18 million children. [HHS,
10/7/14 ]
American consumers have saved $9 billion since 2011,
because the law says that insurance companies have to spend at least 80
cents of every premium dollar they receive on providing health care.
[HHS,
10/7/14 ]
Medicare Part B
premiums will not go up for the second year in a row in 2015
compared to
premiums that skyrocketed by 112 percent between 2000 and 2008. The
life of the Medicare Trust Fund has been extended by 13 years. [CMS,
7/28/14 ]
Instead of wasting
time and money on efforts to repeal a law that is helping millions of
American families, House Republicans should work with Democrats to focus
on the issues that matter most, including creating jobs, fixing our
nations broken immigration system, and securing equal pay for equal
work.
To learn more about coverage and eligibility for
tax credits to make coverage more affordable, visit
www.HealthCare.gov . Americans without access to the internet or who
prefer not to enroll online can get information and sign up through
the Call Center at
1-800-318-2596 (TTY
1-855-889-4325) . After identifying the best option, those seeking coverage have until
February 15, 2015 , to enroll.
However, they
must sign up by December 15 in order for coverage to begin on January 1,
2015.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric
Richmond
2nd Congressional District of Louisiana
