Friend,
Thanks so much for taking the time to make your voice heard.
By signing our climate change petition, you join thousands of others across the country in defense of our planet.
That&#39;s a big deal.
If you haven&#39;t signed yet, it&#39;s not too late -- click here to add your name.
Congress must take action to combat the growing threat of climate change. My opponent disagrees -- so it&#39;s important that we stop him from joining the chorus of denial in Congress.
Help us keep the conversation on climate change moving in the right direction -- support our reelection efforts with $3 today.
Thanks again -- this stuff matters.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS -- Even $3 will go a long way in our reelection efforts. This race is going to be down to the wire. Click here to give what you can.
