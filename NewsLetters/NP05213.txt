Update from Senator Bob Corker

2014
Robust, Comprehensive Response to Ebola Outbreak
Needed
Senator Corker released the following statement last
Wednesday regarding the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and
the need for a robust, comprehensive response that includes
restricting tourism and non-essential travel to the United
States:
We have an obligation to protect American citizens first as we
continue to work with other countries to prevent the spread of this
deadly disease. Until the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is under control,
the United States should, as part of a robust, comprehensive response,
restrict tourism and non-essential travel from the affected region to
the United States.

Wall Street
Journal Urges Administration to Embrace Corker Iran
Legislation
An
editorial
in last weeks
Wall Street Journal urged the Obama administration to embrace
legislation sponsored by Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, that gives U.S. stronger leverage in nuclear
negotiations with Iran. The editorial states the
Iran
Nuclear Negotiations Act of 2014
sends a message to Iran that
Congress wont sign off on a bad agreement that puts Americas interests at
risk and is ready to double down on sanctions.
The
Administration is currently leaning on Democrats in the Senate to block
an attempt by Republicans to give Congress a say on any Iran accord. In
late July, Bob Corker, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and John McCain
the GOPs strongest voices on foreign policyintroduced the Iran
Nuclear Negotiations Act of 2014. The bill compels the Administration to
submit any agreement for Senate review within three days of completion.
If Iran walks away from the table without a deal, the sanctions
waived last November would be immediately reimposed. The bill also puts in
place a quick mechanism to reimpose sanctions in case Iran cheats on a
deal. Both provisions are sensible safeguards, the editorial
states.
