Denver Post Op-Ed: Hold the VA
Accountable

Denver Post
Op-Ed: Hold the VA Accountable
By Senators Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner, Congressmen Mike
Coffman, Ed Perlmutter, Scott Tipton, and Doug Lamborn, and Congresswoman
Diana DeGette
For
more than two decades, Rocky Mountain veterans have waited for a new
facility to replace Denver's aging Veterans Affairs hospital, which is
overcrowded and cannot fully serve the health care needs of our
veterans. The goal of the new VA hospital in Aurora is to serve the hundreds
of thousands of veterans in Colorado and across the Rocky Mountain
region with services to meet service-specific needs such as a spinal cord
injury unit, a PTSD clinic, and research
capabilities.
Through the years,
the Department of Veterans Affairs has started, stopped, delayed and
changed the replacement project more times than we can count. Then,
finally, in August 2009, the VA broke ground at the Fitzsimons medical
campus on a state-of-the-art medical center for our
veterans.
Since then,
the VA has grossly mismanaged this project to the point where we were
recently informed that the project is now almost $1 billion over budget
and years away from completion. Suffice it to say, we are shocked and
appalled at the incompetence and mismanagement by the VA on this
project.
We need an independent investigation to determine what exactly went
wrong and who at the VA needs to be held
accountable.
For far too long, the
VA has brushed its problems under the rug and refused to make serious
changes. We won't let that happen with this project. We are committed
to real accountability and structural changes within the VA to ensure
it does not recklessly spend taxpayer dollars on this or any other
project and that it provides the highest quality of care and service for
those who served
us.
To meet all these objectives requires Congress to
act, and to act swiftly before the construction effort hits the maximum
cost currently allowed by
law.
We can accomplish this through the VA
Construction, Accountability, and Reform Act. This bill raises the
authorization cap to allow construction to continue and strips construction
management authority away from the VA for all future hospitals and gives
it to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is much better suited to
manage large construction projects. It also prohibits the VA from
awarding $360 million per year in bonuses until the hospital is complete,
funding which could be redirected to the
project.
We stand together in
our resolve to hold the VA accountable and to complete our hospital.
Even though the VA has taken some steps to right this wrong, words cannot
describe our outrage and anger at the new price tag or the negligence
and
incompetence.
But we cannot forget who this project will benefit and
why we remain adamant that it gets built. Building this facility is
critically needed to care for our growing veteran population. This is
the ultimate goal, and we are committed to continuing to work together
to do what is necessary to complete this hospital and hold the VA
accountable.
