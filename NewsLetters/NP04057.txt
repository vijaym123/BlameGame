Rep. Bob Goodlatte
House Advances the Achieving a Better Life Experience
Act
Opportunity, security, and empowerment &ndash; as a parent, these are three things you pray your children
will experience in life. Families of individuals with disabilities are no different. Recently, the House of Representatives acted on legislation that
would have a significant impact on the lives of millions of individuals with disabilities.
People with disabilities face many challenges, including financial struggles. Programs like Medicaid or Social Security Disability
Insurance can provide for medical care and certain expenses, but for individuals with disabilities who want to seek post-secondary education, those
programs may not be enough to cover their costs. Currently, parents of these children cannot save much for their child with disabilities for fear of
their losing eligibility for programs that assist the disabled.
This is not the right message to send to these individuals or their families. We want
to empower those with disabilities to be as independent as possible and go as far in life as any other child, and we don&rsquo;t want to discourage
families from saving for their child&rsquo;s future.
The
Achieving a
Better Life Experience Act , or
ABLE Act , would amend the federal tax code to allow individuals with disabilities to set up tax-free
savings accounts for qualified expenses. These accounts would be much like the 529 savings accounts many families already maintain to save for college
tuition. Under the
ABLE Act , individuals with disabilities and their families would have the option to contribute funds to these savings
accounts that could be used to cover future health care, education, career development, transportation, retirement, and housing costs.
Many of us have a loved one or know someone living with Down syndrome or
another serious disability. I have been fortunate enough to meet one family from Roanoke, Bill and Tammy Lawfield and their young daughter, Madison,
to discuss this issue on several occasions. Madison has Down syndrome, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she shouldn&rsquo;t have the same opportunities as
other children. Legislation like the
ABLE Act
would allow Madison&rsquo;s family to invest in her future and help ensure greater financial
security for Madison&rsquo;s life.
What may seem like a simple concept would make a positive difference in the lives of people with disabilities in our communities. Our laws
should empower Americans to succeed, not get in the way of this success. The
ABLE Act
strives to give individuals with disabilities every
opportunity to save for the future, just like you and I.
I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will agree and approve this legislation so that we
can send it to the President before the end of the year.
President's
Immigration Power Grab is a Danger to America
Earlier this week, the House Judiciary Committee
held a hearing to examine the unconstitutionality of President Obama's recent executive actions on immigration. Congress also began its fight against
this unprecedented power grab
by passing
the
Preventing
Executive Overreach on Immigration Act . The Constitution is clear: it is the role of Congress to make all laws, the Judiciary to interpret the
laws, and the President to enforce the laws. The House will continue to fight President Obama&rsquo;s unconstitutional actions and will shine light on
and correct the Obama administration&rsquo;s anti-enforcement policies.
