Two Days to Go!
Friday, February 13, 2015
Dear Friend,
Are you one of the thousands of Central Coast residents who have signed up for healthcare coverage through Covered California, our state health insurance marketplace? If you aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not too late to get insured, and you should consider signing up before the February 15th deadline at
CoveredCA.com
or by calling (800) 300-1506.
I also wanted to share with you an op-ed I wrote yesterday about how - regardless of one&rsquo;s political views - we can all agree that everyone should have access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage. We cannot allow politics to get in the way of public health.
For more about how Covered California is impacting the lives of thousands of people in our state and how it might work for you, check out my op-ed in either the
Santa Barbara Independent
or the
San Luis Obispo Tribune .
Finally, I&rsquo;d also love to hear about your experiences with Covered California so feel free to
send me an email . You can also keep in touch by
liking my Facebook page
or
following me on Twitter .
Please feel free to forward this information along to your friends and family and don&rsquo;t forget, it&rsquo;s not too late to sign up for health coverage but you only have two days left.
Sincerely,
Lois Capps
