Rep. Curbelo Rises In Support of Magnuson-Stevens
Reauthorization
Washington, DC
- Rep. Curbelo (FL-26) issued the following statement in support of
H.R. 1335, The Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility Act:
"I am pleased the House reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which is critical to the fisheries in Floridas 26th Congressional District. The communities I am honored to represent in the South Florida, including Islamorada, the Sports Fishing Capitol of the World, are dependent on healthy fish stocks for both commercial and recreational fishermen.
The important reforms in H.R. 1335 improve existing law by allowing scientifically-based management flexibility for our Regional Fishery Management Councils, promoting responsible fishing and preventing over-fishing. I thank the House Committee on Natural Resources for their hard work on this legislation for the fishermen in Florida and the thousands of anglers from around the world that visit our state each year."
The House passed H.R. 1335 on June 1 by a vote of 225-152. Due to severe weather in Washington, D.C., Rep. Curbelo and 54 Members were unable to make votes, as travel was significantly delayed. Had Rep. Curbelo been present, he would proudly have voted YEA on H.R. 1335.
