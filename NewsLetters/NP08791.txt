Dear Friend:
Happy Father's Day to all the North Florida dads who have done so much
to strengthen families and build a better future for our children.
For
me, there's no man who has had a bigger influence on my life than my
own dad and the man I'm named after, Steve Southerland.
I am truly
blessed to have an amazing father who instilled a clear commitment in
me to faith, family, and community.
To all the dads out there, I hope
you enjoy your day surrounded by the ones you love.
Sgt. Bergdahl Poll Results
In our most recent constituent survey, I asked if you support the
President's decision to bypass Congress and exchange five hardened
terrorists for Sgt. Bergdahl's freedom.
With over 4,000 people
participating, a clear majority - 70% in all - concluded the President
made the wrong decision.
Like most Americans, I found the President's
decision deeply troubling and believe it sets a dangerous precedent
with serious implications on our national security.
In response, I have cosponsored a House resolution condemning the
President's failure to comply with national security law and the
ramifications that may follow from breaking the long-standing policy of
not negotiating with terrorists.
Also, this past week Congress began a
full and thorough investigation into the President's actions and the
impact it will have on our service members currently in harm's way.
Expanding Veterans' Access to Health Care
With more than 57,000 veterans waiting 90 days or more to receive their
initial VA appointment, immediate action was needed to address this
mistreatment of our veterans.
I was proud to vote for the House-passed
Veterans Access to Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 4810), legislation that
provides veterans facing lengthy wait times at VA hospitals with
immediate access to private-sector health care.
While further action
is needed to hold the VA accountable, I am hopeful the Senate will join
us in passing this legislation to provide our veterans with the timely,
quality health care they deserve.
Fighting Rural Poverty in North Florida
Nobody knows our poverty challenges better than the people who fight
for families in need on a daily basis.
For that reason I recently
hosted an anti-poverty roundtable discussion in Marianna to highlight
the work local community leaders from across North Florida's rural
counties are doing to combat poverty. This event provided a unique
opportunity to get everyone together, listen to their hearts, and
better understand how we in Washington can best help them in fighting
rural poverty.
Focusing on Local Job Creation
I recently had the opportunity to sit down with the Bay County Chamber
of Commerce Board of Directors to discuss local job growth.
As a
former chair of the Bay County Chamber and member of the Economic
Development Alliance, I understand the opportunities facing our local
economy and have been focused on promoting economic development and
creating good-paying jobs for North Florida residents.
Reducing the Tax Burden on Small Businesses
As a third generation small business owner, I understand that every
dollar Washington takes away from our job creators is money that could
go towards growing a business and hiring new employees.
That's why I
am proud to have recently supported House passage of the America's
Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014, which will permanently allow
small businesses to deduct the cost of new equipment and property, and
the S Corporation Permanent Tax Relief Act of 2014, which will
permanently give small businesses organized as S Corporations the
ability to access capital without tax penalties.
Staff Mobile Office Hours
Residents of Franklin, Gulf, and Washington counties are invited to
join our staff for mobile office hours to provide us input on
legislation, ask questions, or request assistance with a federal agency
on issues including: Social Security, Medicare, Housing and Urban
Development, IRS, Veterans Affairs, and Immigration.

Dear
Friend:
Happy
Father&#8217;s
Day
to
all
the
North
Florida
dads
who
have
done
so
much
to
strengthen
families
and
build
a
better
future
for
our
children.
For
me,
there&#8217;s
no
man
who
has
had
a
bigger
influence
on
my
life
than
my
own
dad
and
the
man
I&#8217;m
named
after,
Steve
Southerland.
I
am
truly
blessed
to
have
an
amazing
father
who
instilled
a
clear
commitment
in
me
to
faith,
family,
and
community.
To
all
the
dads
out
there,
I
hope
you
enjoy
your
day
surrounded
by
the
ones
you
love.
Sgt.
Bergdahl
Poll
Results
In
our
most
recent
constituent
survey,
I
asked
if
you
support
the
President's
decision
to
bypass
Congress
and
exchange
five
hardened
terrorists
for
Sgt.
Bergdahl's
freedom.
With
over
4,000
people
participating,
a
clear
majority
&#8211;
70%
in
all
&#8211;
concluded
the
President
made
the
wrong
decision.
Like
most
Americans,
I
found
the
President&#8217;s
decision
deeply
troubling
and
believe
it
sets
a
dangerous
precedent
with
serious
implications
on
our
national
security.
In
response,
I
have
cosponsored
a
House
resolution
condemning
the
President&#8217;s
failure
to
comply
with
national
security
law
and
the
ramifications
that
may
follow
from
breaking
the
long-standing
policy
of
not
negotiating
with
terrorists.
Also,
this
past
week
Congress
began
a
full
and
thorough
investigation
into
the
President&#8217;s
actions
and
the
impact
it
will
have
on
our
service
members
currently
in
harm&#8217;s
way.
Expanding
Veterans&#8217;
Access
to
Health
Care
With
more
than
57,000
veterans
waiting
90
days
or
more
to
receive
their
initial
VA
appointment,
immediate
action
was
needed
to
address
this
mistreatment
of
our
veterans.
I
was
proud
to

for
the
House-passed
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
of

(H.R.
4810),
legislation
that
provides
veterans
facing
lengthy
wait

at
VA
hospitals
with
immediate
access
to
private-sector
health
care.
While
further
action
is
needed
to
hold
the
VA
accountable,
I
am
hopeful
the
Senate
will
join
us
in
passing
this
legislation
to
provide
our
veterans
with
the
timely,
quality
health
care
they
deserve.
Fighting
Rural
Poverty
in
North
Florida
Nobody
knows
our
poverty
challenges
better
than
the
people
who
fight
for
families
in
need
on
a
daily
basis.
For
that
reason
I
recently
hosted
an
anti-poverty
roundtable
discussion
in
Marianna
to
highlight
the
work
local
community
leaders
from
across
North
Florida&#8217;s
rural
counties
are
doing
to
combat
poverty.
This
event
provided
a
unique
opportunity
to
get
everyone
together,
listen
to
their
hearts,
and
better
understand
how
we
in
Washington
can
best
help
them
in
fighting
rural
poverty.
Focusing
on
Local
Job
Creation
I
recently
had
the
opportunity
to
sit
down
with
the
Bay
County
Chamber
of
Commerce
Board
of
Directors
to
discuss
local
job
growth.
As
a
former
chair
of
the
Bay
County
Chamber
and
member
of
the
Economic
Development
Alliance,
I
understand
the
opportunities
facing
our
local
economy
and
have
been
focused
on
promoting
economic
development
and
creating
good-paying
jobs
for
North
Florida
residents.
Reducing
the
Tax
Burden
on
Small
Businesses
As
a
third
generation
small
business
owner,
I
understand
that
every
dollar
Washington
takes
away
from
our
job
creators
is
money
that
could
go
towards
growing
a
business
and
hiring
new
employees.
That&#8217;s
why
I
am
proud
to
have
recently
supported
House
passage
of
the
America's
Small
Business
Tax
Relief
Act
of
2014,
which
will
permanently
allow
small
businesses
to
deduct
the
cost
of
new
equipment
and
property,
and
the
S
Corporation
Permanent
Tax
Relief
Act
of
2014,
which
will
permanently
give
small
businesses
organized
as
S
Corporations
the
ability
to
access
capital
without
tax
penalties.
Staff
Mobile
Office
Hours
Residents
of
Franklin,
Gulf,
and
Washington
counties
are
invited
to
join
our
staff
for
mobile
office
hours
to
provide
us
input
on
legislation,
ask
questions,
or
request
assistance
with
a
federal
agency
on
issues
including:
Social
Security,
Medicare,
Housing
and
Urban
Development,
IRS,
Veterans
Affairs,
and
Immigration.
