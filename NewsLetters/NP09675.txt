News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
As I'm sure most of you have probably heard at this point, it's become
clear over the last few weeks that a number of VA facilities around the
country have been keeping so-called "secret wait lists".
The point of
these lists, at least in the case of Arizona, was to hide the true
number of veterans who had been waiting extraordinary periods for
treatment at the VA.
In a number of those cases, the veterans died
needlessly because they did not receive the medical attention they
needed.
On Thursday, news broke that what may be a similar list was
discovered at the VA facility in Gainesville.
The list, which
contained more than two hundred names, related to mental health
appointments.
At this point, it's not clear whether it's the same situation.
Officials with the VA have readily acknowledged that the handwritten
list was a breach of protocol.
I suspect we will learn more in the
days ahead, but when taken into context with everything else that is
going on, I have serious, serious concerns.
In short, I believe that what has happened with the VA constitutes a
deep breach of trust - with the veterans themselves, with Congress, and
with the American people.
Congress has been purposefully misled and at
this point, I have a sincerely hard time believing them when they say,
"everything is fine and the issues are being addressed."
In my
opinion, we're well passed that.
I have called for Secretary Shinseki's resignation.
That's not
something I take lightly.
I truly believe, however, that at this
point, the only way to restore faith and improve accountability is for
the leadership to change at the VA.
Sec. Shinseki has been at the helm
of the VA since the President took office.
It's not enough, in my
opinion, for him to express his outrage at what has happened on his
watch.
It's time for him to step aside and for us to bring in new
leadership.
We'll have more to report on the VA in the coming weeks, but suffice it
to say, these "secret wait lists" are not the only thing going on there
that Americans should be appalled at.
In the meantime, this is the statement I released
to the press.
As I mentioned
at the end of it, it's important that veterans know that if they are
being ignored by the VA, they should contact me.
If I had known that a
veteran in urgent need of care was being denied an appointment to see a
doctor, I would have moved heaven and earth to get that situation
resolved. Not everybody knows that members of Congress can serve as a
resource in that regard, but it's a fundamentally important part of
what we do as your representatives in the federal government.
In any case, that's what we've got going on this week.
If there is
anything else you think I should be aware of, please let me know.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
As
I&#8217;m
sure
most
of
you
have
probably
heard
at
this
point,
it&#8217;s
become
clear
over
the
last
few
weeks
that
a
number
of
VA
facilities
around
the
country
have
been
keeping
so-called
&#8220;secret
wait
lists&#8221;.
The
point
of
these
lists,
at
least
in
the
case
of
Arizona,
was
to
hide
the
true
number
of
veterans
who
had
been
waiting
extraordinary
periods
for
treatment
at
the
VA.
In
a
number
of
those
cases,
the
veterans
died
needlessly
because
they
did
not
receive
the
medical
attention
they
needed.
On
Thursday,
news
broke
that
what
may
be
a
similar
list
was
discovered
at
the
VA
facility
in
Gainesville.
The
list,
which
contained
more
than
two
hundred
names,
related
to
mental
health
appointments.
At
this
point,
it&#8217;s
not
clear
whether
it&#8217;s
the
same
situation.
Officials
with
the
VA
have
readily
acknowledged
that
the
handwritten
list
was
a
breach
of
protocol.
I
suspect
we
will
learn
more
in
the
days
ahead,
but
when
taken
into
context
with
everything
else
that
is
going
on,
I
have
serious,
serious
concerns.
In
short,
I
believe
that
what
has
happened
with
the
VA
constitutes
a
deep
breach
of
trust
&#8211;
with
the
veterans
themselves,
with
Congress,
and
with
the
American
people.
Congress
has
been
purposefully
misled
and
at
this
point,
I
have
a
sincerely
hard
time
believing
them
when
they
say,
&#8220;everything
is
fine
and
the
issues
are
being
addressed.&#8221;
In
my
opinion,
we&#8217;re
well
passed
that.
I
have
called
for
Secretary
Shinseki&#8217;s
resignation.
That&#8217;s
not
something
I
take
lightly.
I
truly
believe,
however,
that
at
this
point,
the
only
way
to
restore
faith
and
improve
accountability
is
for
the
leadership
to
change
at
the
VA.
Sec.
Shinseki
has
been
at
the
helm
of
the
VA
since
the
President
took
office.
It&#8217;s
not
enough,
in
my
opinion,
for
him
to
express
his
outrage
at
what
has
happened
on
his
watch.
It&#8217;s
time
for
him
to
step
aside
and
for
us
to
bring
in
new
leadership.
We&#8217;ll
have
more
to
report
on
the
VA
in
the
coming
weeks,
but
suffice
it
to
say,
these
&#8220;secret
wait
lists&#8221;
are
not
the
only
thing
going
on
there
that
Americans
should
be
appalled
at.
In
the
meantime,
this
is
the
statement
I
released
to
the
press.
As
I
mentioned
at
the
end
of
it,
it&#8217;s
important
that
veterans
know
that
if
they
are
being
ignored
by
the
VA,
they
should
contact
me.
If
I
had
known
that
a
veteran
in
urgent
need
of
care
was
being
denied
an
appointment
to
see
a
doctor,
I
would
have
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
get
that
situation
resolved.
Not
everybody
knows
that
members
of
Congress
can
serve
as
a
resource
in
that
regard,
but
it&#8217;s
a
fundamentally
important
part
of
what
we
do
as
your
representatives
in
the
federal
government.
In
any
case,
that&#8217;s
what
we&#8217;ve
got
going
on
this
week.
If
there
is
anything
else
you
think
I
should
be
aware
of,
please
let
me
know.
Thanks
again.

Nugent Member

Congress
