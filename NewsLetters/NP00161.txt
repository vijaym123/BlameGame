Friends,
Under Obamacare, the sale of life-saving medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps and heart valves are taxed.
Besides the fact that this tax has already cost tens of thousands of good-paying jobs,
it stifles innovation by discouraging investment in the medical device industry.

Today, I voted to repeal this ill-conceived tax.
Its repeal will not only create jobs but also restore an innovative environment that could lead to the next big medical breakthrough, potentially saving countless lives.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
