We will fail to hit our goal.
David, we&rsquo;ve tried everything.
-- President Obama has emailed you.
-- President Clinton has emailed you.
-- I&rsquo;ve sent more emails than I can count.
But with Republican outside groups spending $2O,OOO,OOO -- this week alone -- we still need 32,OOO more online donations to be able to compete.
It&rsquo;s hard to see that happening with just 24 hours until tomorrow&rsquo;s ad buy deadline.
So before I have to make some painful decisions, I have to ask one more time: can you please donate to President Clinton&rsquo;s call-to-action, and help me limit the damage? URGENT: All donations to this email Triple-Matched Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
I don&rsquo;t want to look back on Election Day with any regrets. Will you step up? https://action.dccc.org/Ad-Buy-Deadline
No regrets,
Nancy
