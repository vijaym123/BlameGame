Supporting Our Small Businesses
South Carolina is a great place to live and work, and our small
businesses are a vital part of our economy.
On National Small Business
Week and every week, we celebrate their success and their contributions
to our communities.
??It was a pleasure to see Nancy Ogburn from Irmo,
South Carolina, in Washington this week as she was honored as the South
Carolina Small Business Person of the Year. Congratulations to her and
to everyone who works hard every day chasing their American Dream.
Remember to support your local small businesses!
Celebrating Education
This Saturday marks the 60th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of
Education decision that opened doors in education to millions of
children across the United States.
We have a lot to celebrate, but there is more work to be done.
Education continues to be one of the most important stepping stones
between poverty and success.
The anniversary of this important
decision is a great time for us to recommit to the vital goal of
providing a quality education to all children, regardless of
background.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.

contact info is below-please do not hesitate to contact one of my
