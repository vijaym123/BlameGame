Corps Regulations Cited as Factor in
Missed Economic Development Opportunity
in Southside Virginia
Hurt bill would address problem
impacting jobs to Pittsylvania
County
In case you
missed it, the
Danville Register &amp; Bee
reports
today that state and local
officials cite U.S Army Corps of
Engineers regulations and policies as a
factor that unnecessarily hindered the
Danville-Pittsylvania County areas
ability to compete for a recent major
economic development initiative that
would have brought more than 2,000 jobs
to the area. These unnecessary regulatory
burdens are preventing local economic
development officials from obtaining
permits to move forward on the Berry Hill
Mega Park industrial site, which is
inhibiting their ability to market the
area, attract new major employers, and
with them, much-needed jobs. It is
unacceptable that federal red tape is
reducing Fifth District
communities competitiveness at a
time when unemployment remains far too
high.
To address
this problem, Congressman Hurt introduced
bipartisan, bicameral legislation
the
Commonsense Permitting for Job Creation
Act
to stop regulators from
denying such permits on the grounds of
so-called speculative
development. Congress must act on
this important legislation to stop the
Corps regulatory overreach and
allow communities like Danville and
Pittsylvania County to enhance their
ability to compete bring jobs to the
area.
