NEWS UPDATE: TPA ON THE HOUSE FLOOR THIS WEEK
The House may consider Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) on the Floor this week. In the
Weekly Republican Address , I explain what TPA is and why its important for American economic growth and American job creation. Simply put, TPA is a timeline and a process for Congress and the administration to pass free trade agreements. Trade agreements knock down barriers so American companies can sell their goods and services overseas. Learn more and watch the address
here .
Like I said in the address, are you concerned about transparency?
Read
more about the strict transparency and oversight requirements. Concerned about what happens if theres a bad deal?
Read
about the off switch, and how Congress has the power to change U.S. law and implement trade agreements.
Trade is good for
Ohios businesses and for Ohios workers . Support
grows
as people
learn
to separate
fact from fiction
about what TPA is and isnt. The bottom line is passing TPA will provide a unique opportunity to pass trade agreements that give American businesses access to more than one billion new customers. As consideration of this measure moves ahead, follow me on
Twitter
and
Facebook
to stay up to date on the latest TPA news.
