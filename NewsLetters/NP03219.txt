SPECIAL EDITION SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
Moments ago, President Obama gave his State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the U.S.Capitol. We heard him double down on a number of failed policies that overpromise and under-deliver. The president needs to finally admit that the old top-down, Washington-knows-best approach just doesnt work and that there is a better way.
Despite his claims to the contrary, President Obamas proposals are not 'middle class economics.' In fact, nearly 80 percent of the American people will not qualify for any of the presidents new spending and tax credits. Under President Obamas approach outlined tonight, you can only get a tax break if you do what Washington tells you to do. The best way to create a healthy economy would be to lower rates for every hard-working taxpayer and let families decide how best to spend their money.
The most promising part of the speech was the presidents request for the renewal of trade promotion authority. I am strongly supportive of increased free trade, which will strengthen exports and create stronger strategic partnerships around the globe that will benefit the Port of New Orleans and the people of southeast Louisiana. House and Senate Republicans are ready to work with the White House to lower barriers for U.S. exports, strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base, and create good-paying American jobs.
I encourage President Obama to start working with this new American Congress to create a healthy economy with a bottom-up approach that puts hard-working taxpayers back in control of their own destiny.
