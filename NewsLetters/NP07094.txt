ISSUES
LEGISLATION
August 17, 2014
Dear
David,
Over the past few weeks, I have been enjoying the opportunity
to travel across the district and meet with local businesses,
organizations, and constituents to listen to concerns, answer questions, and
provide updates on pending legislation.
This past week, I
held a community meeting in Grass Valley where I was able to discuss a
broad scope of issues with local residents. I also met with Chicos
First Responders and appreciated hearing their concerns and ideas,
especially pertaining to veterans issues. In between meetings, I was able
to catch up with colleagues from Californias State Senate and
Assembly, including former staffers, who continue to work hard to serve the
people of California.
Meeting with constituents and learning
more about important issues facing the North State is important to me
and I look forward to holding more community meetings throughout the
month of August. I included information below about upcoming events in
Redding and Yreka. I hope to hear from you
soon!
Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa
meeting with constituents at a community meeting in Grass Valley.

Your Thoughts
Last month, I met with many residents
across the North State to discuss the Bureau of Reclamations proposal to
raise the Shasta Dam, which would increase the lakes depth as much as
18.5 feet.
The water supply in the state of California is
already stretched to its practical limits. To put this into
perspective, the State Water Project was constructed when California's population
was only 16 million people. Today it is well over 38 million, and
increases in water supply have been sorely lacking in comparison to this
increase in population. I believe its important that we take a hard
look at proposals to raise the Shasta Dam. However, I do not believe
achieving economic stability and environmental stability is an either -
or proposition. To the contrary, there is plenty of room for middle
ground, which is why I want to hear from you. Please take my survey
below to share your views on how this proposal may affect you, your family
or your business.
More information about the Bureaus
proposal, including the full draft study, may be found
here.
As the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation continues to finalize the Shasta Lake Water
Resources Investigation, your input is important. How will the raising of
Shasta Dam affect you, your family, or your business?
