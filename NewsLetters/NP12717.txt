.
A week ago, President Obama made his annual State of the Union speech.
He tried to convince us that our economy is better off today than it
was when he first took office.
However, our national debt is 18
trillion dollars and growing, the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act
has proven disastrous, and executive overreach has become the new
normal in Washington.
Take my survey to tell me what you thought of the president's speech,
and how Congress should move forward in 2014.
