Friends,
I just wanted to take this opportunity to wish you and your family a
Merry Christmas and a wonderful holiday season. This is such a special
time of year - a time of joy, a time of hope, a time of giving.
It's also a time when we should make sure to remember those who are
struggling and do our part to lend a helping hand. Many are having a
hard time financially, are battling an illness, or have emotional
struggles. And for some, the holiday season is the loneliest time of
all.
Let's remember to give back this year by helping those in need. Whether
it is giving of your time by volunteering or giving of your money to
help a worthy cause, I hope you'll share the joy of this Christmas
season with those less fortunate.
I also want to thank you again for allowing me to serve as your
representative in Washington. This year alone, my office has responded
to more than 5,000 constituent letters, arranged hundreds of visits to
our nation's Capitol, and assisted countless constituents with federal
problems they experience, varying from streamling veterans benefits to
helping Social Security beneficiaries with unprocessed claims. I am
proud of my staff for their hard work on behalf of the Second District.
I want to say a special thank you to Mrs. Frances Spurlin who works in
my Andalusia office. At the end of this month, Frances will be retiring
after 27 years of faithful and exemplary service to Alabama's Second
Congressional District. Please join me in wishing Frances and her
husband, Gordon, health and happiness in the years ahead.
I hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday. May we all share
the joy and hope of this special season. Merry Christmas!

Friends,
I
just
wanted
to
take
this
opportunity
to
wish
you
and
your
family
a
Merry
Christmas
and
a
wonderful
holiday
season.
This
is
such
a
special
time
of
year
&#8211;
a
time
of
joy,
a
time
of
hope,
a
time
of
giving.
It's
also
a
time
when
we
should
make
sure
to
remember
those
who
are
struggling
and
do
our
part
to
lend
a
helping
hand.
Many
are
having
a
hard
time
financially,
are
battling
an
illness,
or
have
emotional
struggles.
And
for
some,
the
holiday
season
is
the
loneliest
time
of
all.
Let's
remember
to
give
back
this
year
by
helping
those
in
need.
Whether
it
is
giving
of
your
time
by
volunteering
or
giving
of
your
money
to
help
a
worthy
cause,
I
hope
you'll
share
the
joy
of
this
Christmas
season
with
those
less
fortunate.
I
also
want
to
thank
you
again
for
allowing
me
to
serve
as
your
representative
in
Washington.
This
year
alone,
my
office
has
responded
to
more
than
5,000
constituent

arranged
hundreds
of
visits
to
our

with

I
am
proud
of
my
staff
for
their
hard
work
on
behalf
of
the
Second
District.
I
want
to
say
a
special
thank
you
to
Mrs.
Frances
Spurlin
who
works

At
the

Frances
will
be

you
and

we
all
