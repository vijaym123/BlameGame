U.S. Service Academy Applications Due by October 15
CRESCENT SPRINGS, KY
- Each year, Members of Congress have the privilege of recommending exceptional young people for admission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Merchant Marine Academy, known collectively as the U.S. Service Academies.
The U.S. Service Academies offer a unique opportunity for motivated young men and women to serve their country while improving all facets of their character through a rigorous scholastic curriculum and a disciplined moral and physical regimen. In place of tuition, the Academies ask for military service after graduation. Cadets and Midshipmen graduate as Officers in the United States Military, and many have gone on to be great leaders in our nations history.
Competition for the limited number of opportunities is extremely high. Nominees are chosen based on several factors including character, leadership, academic excellence, physical aptitude, and extracurricular activities. Rep. Massie will recommend the most qualified applicants from the Fourth District.
The deadline to submit an application is Wednesday, October 15th, 2014. To apply, please request a Military Academy Nomination form from Rep. Massie's Northern Kentucky Office:
