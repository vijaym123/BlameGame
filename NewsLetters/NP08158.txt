A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H.
HOYER
Today
marks the beginning of the fifth annual Member Online All-Star
Competition, a friendly competition between my House Democratic colleagues that
I host each year to connect with constituents on
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
Instagram , and
YouTube . These social media platforms
are important tools I use to update Fifth District constituents on
what I am doing on Capitol Hill and in Maryland.
It also provides
another opportunity for constituents to share their concerns and ask
questions. Please connect with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
Instagram , and
YouTube , if you haven't already done
so.
I'd also like to invite you to
participate in my 2014 Facebook Cover Photo Contest. The Facebook
timeline format allows users to share a cover photo on their page, and each
year, I invite constituents to submit their best photo taken in the
Fifth District to be considered as my cover photo. I encourage you to
submit your high quality photos taken in Maryland to be considered for
use as the cover photo on my
Facebook
page this
year. To submit, please send the photo, along with your name and where
the photo was taken, to hoyerphotocontest@gmail.com. I will post the
top photos on my Facebook page and announce the winner on Friday, July
18. In order to participate, your photo must be your original work.
