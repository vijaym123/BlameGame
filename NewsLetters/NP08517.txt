Congressman Lamborn Keeps Up the Pressure
on Iran
6/20/14
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn
continued to stand firm against the Iranian nuclear program. In the
House Armed Services Committee, the Congressman
questioned witnesses on the
Iranian nuclear program and the impacts this could have on American
national security.

Jerusalem Post.
"Spinning the West"
You can fool all the people some
of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool
all the people all the time, President Lincoln famously
quipped.
This wise adage comes to
mind as nuclear talks between Iran and the six world powers, led by the
US, are set to resume in Vienna, with the hopes of reaching a
comprehensive agreement over Irans nuclear program ahead of a July 20
deadline.
But we in Congress
will not be fooled. Just a few weeks ago, I offered amendments to the
2015 National Defense Authorization Act to make sure that a final deal
wont whitewash Irans nuclear weapons program. My amendments also make
sure that those companies doing business with Iran wont do business
with our Department of Defense. In this spring of subterfuge, we are
seeing troubling signs that current negotiations may lead to a
nuclear-armed Iran, rather than prevent one.
Troublingly, we have already agreed in advance to the
right of Iran to enrich uranium by forgetting a dozen UN resolutions.
This is the opposite of nonproliferation.
Not a single one of Irans nearly 20,000 centrifuges
about half of them producing uranium enriched to reactor fuel-grade
level
have been dismantled.
And Irans leaders are talking not of dismantling their
countrys nuclear infrastructure, but of increasing it
to as many as 50,000
centrifuges.
Our
nuclear technology is not up for negotiation, Irans President Hassan
Rouhani recently declared.
Moreover, Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who
described Western expectation for his country to curb missile development as
stupid and idiotic, called on Irans Revolutionary Guards to mass
produce missiles. We in Congress refuse to be blindsided by hopes of
any such dangerous deal.
We welcome an agreement that brings Iran back into the family of
peaceful nations, but we will fight any emerging deal that will lead to a
nuclear-armed Iran.
To
this end, the amendment I offered stated that Iran must stop uranium
enrichment, production of weapons of mass destruction and sponsorship of
international terrorism before any final deal is made between the US
and Iran. And even as we speak out against the wave of international
trade delegations flocking to Iran since the interim accord was reached
last year, it appears we have our own accounting to do to prevent
Department of Defense contractors from doing business with
Iran.
To redress this duplicity,
another amendment I have authored and that is now in the bill requires the
Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on DOD contractors that
have done business with Iran. If companies want to do business with the
DOD, they need to think twice about doing business with
Iran.
In the immortal words of
Lincoln, we, the peoples representatives, refuse to be
fooled.
