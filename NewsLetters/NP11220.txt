10 Fascinating Pennsylvania Women
Who was Nellie Bly? Why was she so important for mental health in America?
Find out .
Last month on Buzzfeed, I posted
a list of Pennsylvanians
memorialized in the U.S. Capitol. Some readers asked where the women were. In celebration of Women's History Month, here you go: Undercover reporters. Abolitionists. Suffragists. Civic leaders. Artists.
Take a look
at some amazing Pennsylvania women who made their mark on history!
Protecting Our Children From Sexual Predators &amp; Human Trafficking
With Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick and staff of Bucks County's Network of Victims Assistance
As the father of three young children, I cannot imagine the pain of a parent whose child has been sexually abused. As your U.S. senator, I am dedicated to strengthening laws to better protect kids - in Pennsylvania and across our country.
As part of this commitment, I introduced the
Protecting Students From Sexual And Violent Predators Act
last fall. I have also co-sponsored the bipartisan
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act , which increases criminal penalties for child pornography, child prostitution, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation of children.
This week, at Bucks County's
Network of Victims Assistance , I met with their terrific staff and volunteers, and Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, to learn about what more needs to be done.
Working To Protect American Dairy Producers &amp; Jobs
Watch video
Ridiculous as it may sound, the European Union's food fight with American dairy producers isn't over yet.
The EU's new initiative would force American producers of cheese to change the names of cheeses that originally came from Europe: Cheddar, Muenster, Parmesan, Provolone, and Swiss to name a few.
Generations of Pennsylvania dairy farmers and producers have worked hard to cultivate products and brands that consumers recognize. This EU effort to establish trade guidelines threatens PA dairy jobs.
Take a look at this clip from CBS News "This Morning" to find out why I'm urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Trade Representative to fight back against any attempt by the EU to restrict the use of these familiar brand names.
Working To End Alzheimer's
Did you know that Pennsylvania has the fifth most people suffering from Alzheimer's disease in the nation?
I recently became a member of the bipartisan Congressional
Task Force
on Alzheimer's. And just last week, I cosponsored legislation that would instruct the United States Postal Service to issue and sell an Alzheimer's disease research stamp. Proceeds from the sale of these stamps would be transferred to the
National Institutes of Health
to fund research.
At Philly's Alzheimer's Association of the Delaware Valley, I shared more on how this bipartisan bill can help raise funds to combat this cruel disease. A similar piece of legislation has raised nearly $75 million for breast cancer research since it was enacted in 1998 and I'm hopeful we will see a similar impact in funding Alzheimer's research.
