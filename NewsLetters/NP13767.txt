As mandated by President
Obama's healthcare law, millions of Americans are now forced to
purchase health insurance from the Affordable Care Act exchanges and the
window for enrollment is quickly
closing.
Since the roll out of the President's healthcare law, I have
heard from thousands of Montanans who are losing their coverage or
seeing their premiums skyrocket and I am interested in hearing how this law
continues to affect you and your family. Please take the time to
complete the survey below so I can better serve you.
Having seen the
consequences, do you support or oppose the President's healthcare law?
