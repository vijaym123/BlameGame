Dear Friend,
I'm sure you've read the welcomed news that the House will shortly vote
on a resolution establishing a select committee to further investigate
the terrorist attack in Benghazi that left four Americans dead,
including our Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.
The time for the Obama administration to come clean is long overdue -
the families, friends, and loved ones of the Americans who were
murdered by terrorists deserve answers and justice. They, along with
the American public, have been misled by this administration for too
long and, with each new previously withheld email or memo that is
uncovered, just how far the administration's trail of deception goes
should concern each one of us.
I appreciate the hard work and commitment of the various House
Committees that have poured over thousands of documents and held
numerous oversight hearings relentlessly searching for the truth. While
their dedication has brought us many answers about that fateful night
and the administration's continuing cover-up,
I continue to believe
that we need to coordinate the House's efforts to uncover the full
truth and deliver justice. I've supported a select committee on
Benghazi and look forward to voting for it on the House floor as soon
as possible.
Unfortunately, there will be some that will label this sincere effort
as a political ploy. It saddens me that some folks confuse politics
with getting at the truth and going after those who are responsible
with swift justice. This is what the American people want but more
importantly, it is what the victims and their families deserve.
Sincerely,
George Holding
