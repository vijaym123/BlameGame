Dear Friends,
It is great to be back home in the best district in Florida. Before I
begin a busy district work period around North Central Florida, I want
to talk to you about two important votes I cast last week. Votes, I
believe, will hold our government accountable.
IRS/Lois Lerner
Last Wednesday, I voted in favor of a resolution recommending that the
House of Representatives find Lois G. Lerner, Former Director of the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in contempt of Congress for refusal to
comply with a subpoena issued by the Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform.
This vote will begin the process of protecting the freedom of speech,
which is guaranteed by the Constitution, for all Americans. It will
also hold accountable, Lois Lerner, the Director of the IRS, who at the
time of her tenure targeted Americans for their conservative political
beliefs. Many questions remain to be answered. I often hear people in
government talk about accountability and transparency. The passage of
this resolution, holding Lois Lerner in contempt, begins the process of
holding the IRS accountable for their actions.
Select Committee on Benghazi
Last Thursday, I voted in favor of establishing a select committee to
investigate the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in
Benghazi, on September 11, 2012.
This committee is imperative to get answers to the many questions the
American people still have: who did it; why was our embassy personnel
not protected as prescribed by law; and why was there no attempt to
save our people? Additionally, the American people deserve to know
whether the Administration purposefully misled and concocted the story
that a YouTube video caused the terrorist attack on the anniversary
date of 9/11.
I will never forget when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, "What
difference does it make!" The difference is that four families will not
see a father, brother, or son, ever come home. The difference it makes
is this, if the President and Secretary of State misled the American
people to cover up their failed foreign policies, then the integrity,
character, and trustworthiness of the American government has been
damaged.
If we as Americans cannot trust our own government, then how
can we expect anyone else to?
The purpose of this investigation is to provide closure to the victims'
families and all Americans who seek answers and accountability for this
tragedy.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter and I look
forward to talking to you next week. I hope all the moms out there had
an enjoyable Mother's Day.
Sincerely,
Ted

Rep. Yoho joined Rep. Trent Franks and other members to
discuss how the ACA tax, that is imposed on Americans who fail to buy
health insurance, is unconstitutional. The tax, which originated in the
Senate and not the House, violates the Origination Clause of the
Constitution (Article 1, Section 7). The issue is currently being
addressed in Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human
Services.

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Dear
Friends,
It
is
great
to
be
back
home
in
the
best
district
in
Florida.
Before
I
begin
a
busy
district
work
period
around
North
Central
Florida,
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
two
important
votes
I
cast
last
week.
Votes,
I
believe,
will
hold
our
government
accountable.
IRS/Lois
Lerner
Last
Wednesday,
I voted
in
favor
of
a
resolution
recommending
that
the
House
of
Representatives
find
Lois
G.
Lerner,
Former
Director
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS),
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
refusal
to
comply
with
a
subpoena
issued
by
the
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform.
This
vote
will
begin
the
process
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
speech,
which
is
guaranteed
by
the
Constitution,
for
all
Americans.
It
will
also
hold
accountable,
Lois
Lerner,
the
Director
of
the
IRS,
who
at
the
time
of
her
tenure
targeted
Americans
for
their
conservative
political
beliefs.
Many
questions
remain
to
be
answered.
I
often
hear
people
in
government
talk
about
accountability
and
transparency.
The
passage
of
this
resolution,
holding
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt,
begins
the
process
of
holding
the
IRS
accountable
for
their
actions.
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi
Last
Thursday,
I
voted
in
favor
of
establishing
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
terrorist
attack
on
the
U.S.
diplomatic
post
in
Benghazi,
on
September
11,
2012.
This
committee
is
imperative
to
get
answers
to
the
many
questions
the
American
people
still
have:
who
did
it;
why
was
our
embassy
personnel
not
protected
as
prescribed
by
law;
and
why
was
there
no
attempt
to
save
our
people?
Additionally,
the
American
people
deserve
to
know
whether
the
Administration
purposefully
misled
and
concocted
the
story
that
a
YouTube
video
caused
the
terrorist
attack
on
the
anniversary
date
of
9/11.
I
will
never
forget
when
Secretary
of
State
Hillary
Clinton
said,
&#8220;What
difference
does
it
make!&#8221;
The
difference
is
that
four
families
will
not
see
a
father,
brother,
or
son,
ever
come
home.
The
difference
it
makes
is
this,
if
the
President
and
Secretary
of
State
misled
the
American
people
to
cover
up
their
failed
foreign
policies,
then
the
integrity,
character,
and
trustworthiness
of
the
American
government
has
been
damaged.
If
we
as
Americans
cannot
trust
our
own
government,
then
how
can
we
expect
anyone
else
to?
The
purpose
of
this
investigation
is
to
provide
closure
to
the
victims&#8217;
families
and
all
Americans
who
seek
answers
and
accountability
for
this
tragedy.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
newsletter
and
I
look
forward
to
talking
to
you
next
week.
I
hope
all
the
moms
out
there
had
an
enjoyable
Mother's
Day.
