Dear Friend,
Following the
withdrawal of U.S. military forces in 2011, Iraq has grown increasingly
unstable. Along with the civil war in Syria and other fighting in the
Middle East, a radical sect of Sunni Muslims, now known as the Islamic
State (IS), has emerged and engaged in a brutal campaign for power
with the goal of establishing a "caliphate" (an Islamist state) to rule
all under Sharia law.
Brutally killing and torturing
anyone who does not conform to their version of Islam, we have seen the
savagery of the Islamic State in the appalling treatment and ultimate
beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff at the
hands of black-hooded IS terrorists.
The President will
address the nation tonight to spell out his vision in response to the
radicalized Islamic State terrorists. The Presidents plan, which he
states does not require congressional approval, is expected to include
more US-funded weapons deliveries to Iraqs military and Kurdish forces,
and possibly to Sunni militias, as well as to so-called moderate
rebels in Syria. The President has also requested that Congress authorize
and fund the training of Syrian rebels.
The key public
policy questions are: how involved US forces will get in Iraq and Syria;
how much in US tax dollars will be spent toward this effort; and what
the short and long term US strategy should be in responding to the
growing Islamic State terrorist group.
As
Congress examines these policy questions, I write to get your input. What do
you think the US response to the threat of radicalized terrorists
should be? If you are having trouble, click
