Dear Friend:
In 1980, Congress established Holocaust Remembrance Day to educate Americans about the history of the Holocaust and commemorate its victims.
On this day, we honor the memories of the 6 million Jews and millions of other innocents murdered by the Nazis before and during World War II.
We also honor those brave survivors who lived to bear witness to the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust.
And we remember the righteous heroes who sheltered their neighbors and courageously resisted the hatred and violence around them during this darkest chapter in human history.
The children of my generation heard the Holocaust story first hand from the survivors.
Around my kitchen table, I heard about Anne Frank and cried for her stolen youth and her stolen life.
Now, more than seven decades after this unspeakable genocide, we must work doubly hard to keep its history unquestioned and alive in the world's memory.
In doing so, we not only honor the Holocaust's victims &ndash; we also rededicate ourselves to preventing the evil of genocide anywhere on earth and making real the solemn vow: Never Forget. Never Again.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
