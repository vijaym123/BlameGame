Many people are surprised when they learn that
even though over half of the 50 states have adopted English as their official language, it has not been adopted as the official language of the United States as a whole. In fact, the U.S. is one of a relatively few number of countries around the world that does not have an official language.
Our nation is undeniably unique because of the diversity of its people.
At the same time, there are things that unify our country, like the American flag and our national anthem.
For years, there has been a debate as to whether or not English should also be one of the things that unites our nation, by requiring official functions of the United States be conducted in English. Not too long ago, I cosponsored the English Language Unity Act ( H.R. 997 ), to do just that and declare English as the official language of the United States. Its a commonsense step, and also serves to promote the idea of unifying our country around a common language. I will keep you posted on the progress of this bill.
Yours in service,
Randy
