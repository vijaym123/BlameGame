THE 12TH DISTRICT
|
LEGISLATION
Dear David,
After the passage of the
Biggert-Waters Act to reform flood insurance in 2012, FEMA, the agency
tasked with implementation of the law, did so with no regard for
affordability. Homeowners across the country and in my district saw flood
rate insurance increases in the tens of thousands of dollars
an
unacceptably high increase.
In response, the House came together
to draft and pass H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act of 2013. It was a bipartisan effort, of which I was proud to be
a major part. H.R. 3370 was signed into law on March 21, 2014. This
legislation provided the needed relief to Americans who were suffering
from astronomical flood insurance rate
increases.
Throughout the process, I promised my constituents the passage of H.R. 3370 was
not the end of the process
rather, providing homeowners with
immediate and necessary relief was just the beginning. That is why, this
week, I introduced H.R. 4352, the Flood Insurance Integrity
Act.
My legislation
will require a review of the
NFIP , and will provide transparency and shed much needed light on how
flood rate maps are updated. The NFIP must be administered with
integrity. H.R. 4352 is a good government bill. My constituents who need
flood insurance should be able to know how those costs are calculated, and
should be able to trust the integrity of those calculations. The
Flood Insurance Integrity Act guarantees oversight and transparency
the
American people deserve nothing less.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of
Congress
