The 6th District
Fighting for Our Gulf War
Vets
Dear Friends:
Today, I, along with U.S. Representatives Mike Michaud
(D-ME) and Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ), introduced the
Gulf War
Health Research Reform Act of
2014 .
The legislation is the product of
an extensive investigation by my House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee
for Oversight and Investigation (O&amp; I) that found the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) exercising too much control over the Research
Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) that was denying their
ability to effectively and independently carry out its Congressionally
mandated role to improve the lives of Gulf War
Veterans.
As a Gulf War veteran,
Ive been extremely disappointed at the actions of VA staff to misdirect
Gulf War illnesses research by reviving the scientifically discredited
concept that "the same thing happens after every war" and to
eliminate oversight, just as science is finally making some
progress.
The O&amp;I
Subcommittees investigation into the VAs research efforts regarding the
causes of Gulf War illness uncovered the misuse of funds appropriated for
researching Gulf War Illness that was diverted for other
purposes.
The Subcommittee also found that the RAC had been marginalized by
VAs efforts to embargo their reports and pack the RAC with members who
had a bias toward seeing Gulf War as having a psychosomatic rather
than biological basis.
To remedy these problems, my legislation makes the RAC an
independent committee within the VA and requires that a majority of its
members be appointed by Congress.
It also requires the VA ensures
that research conducted on this disease be referred to as Gulf War
Illness and that the Institute of Medicine reports on the health effects
of toxic exposures veterans were subjected to better understand the
causes and how best to treat the afflicted
veterans.
We have learned a lot in the
last twenty years about the debilitating physical effects of Gulf War
Illness on our veterans, and we need to make sure that we make every
effort to accurately identify, diagnose, and treat them.
To be
sure, it should not take another 20 years for us all to get this
right.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman

Combating sexual assaults in the military
By:
Rep .
Mike Coffman
TheHill
Published:
March 12, 2014
We must end the scourge of sexual assaults in our
military.
When young women
decide to serve their nation in the armed services, they should never
be forced to live under a cloud of intimidation or sexual harassment.
This is a challenge the military must confront and
overcome.
During my own military career,
I have witnessed quite a number of challenges that the military has
had to confront. Each time, it overcame the obstacles, and always
emerged as a more effective fighting force.
For example, in 1972, when I joined the
U.S. Army, I found an army that was fractured along racial lines with
its combat effectiveness further compromised by an epidemic of drug and
alcohol abuse. The combination of these factors produced an Army
plagued by disciplinary problems, poor morale, and very low retention
rates. This was not just an Army problem but was evident in all of the
branches of military service.
The Army responded aggressively to resolve those
problems, and today, when I talk to the newest generation of young people
serving in uniform, the challenges that our military faced in the 1970s
are unthinkable to them.
But today, our military is confronted with a new and
very different challenge, an epidemic of sexual assaults that is
seriously compromising the combat effectiveness of our military. Today, our
soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen are among the most accomplished of
their generation. The standards of the young men and women who serve
in our military have never been higher than at any time in our
nations history.
One fundamental factor that has driven up recruiting standards has
been that many of the militarys occupational career fields have been
opened up to women. By adding women into the mix we have increased the
pool of eligible recruits, raising the standards to make our military
the most professional that our country has ever
had.
Unfortunately, with the
increase in women serving in uniform there has been a reprehensible
increase in the number of sexual assaults and a culture within our
military that, knowingly or unknowingly, has tolerated it.
Members of Congress have
been debating how best to combat the epidemic of sexual assaults
plaguing our military. We seem to have fallen into two camps. The first
supports the leadership of our military in wanting to resolve allegations
of sexual assaults within the chain of command.
The second believes that we should
have independent military prosecutors deal with sexual assault cases
to remove the stigma of reporting the assaults and encourage women to
feel comfortable in stepping forward to bring their assailants to
justice.
I
strongly believe that any allegations of sexual assault should be reported
to authorities outside of the chain of command and thus should be
procedurally treated separately from all other violations listed under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Questions of sexual assault, regarding
military coworkers within the same unit, are always highly sensitive
in nature. My concern is that a unit commander might feel pressure to
resolve a problem that he, or she, might feel reflects poorly on his,
or her, own leadership, or to be an embarrassment to the reputation of
his or her command, on an informal level without having cases properly
vetted and prosecuted, should the facts warrant. The net result could
be fewer victims having the confidence to step forward and to testify
against their attackers.
This is why I support taking the reporting of sexual
assaults outside of the chain of command and will work with Rep. Jackie
Speier (D-Calif.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) so that these
allegations can be investigated by independent military authorities,
and, if necessary, prosecuted accordingly.
This is not a partisan issue. This is
about protecting the young men and women who step forward to risk their
lives in defense of our freedom. I am proud to stand with my
Democratic colleagues to ensure we end the scourge of sexual assaults in our
military.
Coffman has represented Colorados 6th Congressional District since
2009. He sits on the Armed Services; the Veterans Affairs; and the
Small Business committees. He is a retired combat veteran with a combined
21 years of military service between the U.S. Army, Army Reserve, U.S.
Marine Corps and the Marine Corps
Reserve.
AURORA
| Negotiations between the Department of Veterans Affairs and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide oversight for a bogged
down Aurora VA hospital may have broken down, U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman said
Monday, and the Aurora congressman wants to know
why.
Coffman sent a letter to the VA
asking if the two sides were no longer seeking an agreement for the Army
Corps of Engineers to provide oversight and management to the
over-budget VA hospital in Aurora.
I write today to express my concerns regarding reports
indicating a potential breakdown of negotiations between the Department of
Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the replacement
medical center in Aurora, Colorado, Coffman wrote in the letter. I
am pleased that the VA initiated the discussion about bringing USACE
into this vital major construction project. Additionally, I am pleased
that USACE offered to implement their Design-Construction Evaluation
(DCE) process, which has been successfully implemented by other
agencies to help their projects find a path forward to
completion.
Coffman introduced federal
legislation that would require the veterans agency to contract with the
engineering corps for big projects. That bill is slated for a hearing
in a U.S. House subcommittee.
According to VA spokesman Dan Warvi, the department is
waiting to hear on congressional action before commenting on Coffmans
legislation,
Although
the (memorandum of understanding) may be the subject of future
legislation, as yet VA has not put forward any official views on H.R. 3593.
It may be the subject of a future legislative hearing, but VA has not
received formal notice of such a hearing, Warvi wrote in a
statement.
Three other Colorado
representatives today
Rep. Ed Perlmutter and Sens. Mark Udall and
Michael Bennet
have also asked the VA to partner with the engineering
corps for the project.

Coffman Rallies Support for Colorado
Spaceport
Coffman.House.gov
Released :
March 12,
2014
(Washington, D.C.)
Today, U.S. Representative Mike
Coffman (R-Aurora) sent a letter to the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) urging support for Colorado's efforts to obtain a spaceport
operator license for Front Range Airport.
The letter, which was
also signed by Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet and
Representatives Ed Perlmutter, Cory Gardner, Scott Tipton, Diana DeGette, Jared
Polis and Doug Lamborn, outlines in detail how Front Range Airport is
well-situated to develop as a commercial spaceport in
Colorado.
Aerospace and
aviation are significant economic drivers in ColoradoColorado is
well-positioned to play a key role in the continued development of private
commercial space transportation, wrote Coffman in the
letter.
FAA approval will
allow the airport to further generate interest and attract businesses
that specialize in commercial space transportation.
Front Range
Airport is one of the largest general aviation airports in the country,
and Colorado is home to over 400 space-related companies, which
develop everything from satellites to mission-essential software.
This
industry currently employs 66,000 highly-skilled workers and
generates over $16 billion of annual economic activity.
As such, the
effort to establish the nearly 4,000 acres as a spaceport is an issue
that has unanimous support in the Colorado Legislature.
However,
the economic impact will not be limited to
Colorado.
The approval of Front Range
Airport's spaceport operations license has critical economic
importance not only to Colorado and to its aerospace industry, but to the
larger effort to establish private commercial space transportation across
the country, wrote Coffman.
