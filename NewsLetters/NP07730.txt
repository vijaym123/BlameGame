Wielding the Power of the Purse
Dear Friends,
In the U.S. House this week we passed appropriations legislation to tighten the purse strings of the federal government.
The bill cuts funding for the IRS by $341 million, cuts funding for unjustified IRS bonuses, and cuts funding for preparations of executive orders that contradict current law.
The bill also stops the IRS rule that threatens free speech for 501(c)(4)s, prohibits enforcement of the Obamacare individual mandate, prevents destruction of IRS records, requires IRS employees' attendance at taxpayer rights training, prohibits future political targeting, and protects Americans 1st Amendment rights.
We are working to use our power of the purse to rein in this administration.
The many, heavy-handed executive orders coming from the President and the illegal political targeting on the part of the IRS are just two examples of how this administration is overreaching.
They are also two examples of how we are fighting back by hitting them where it hurts the most: the wallet.
If you have any questions or concerns on this or other topics please feel free to
contact me .
Sincerely,
Cynthia M. Lummis
