The 238th Anniversary of American
Independence
As we celebrate today with
family and friends, firing up grills and dressing in our best red,
white, and blue, its important to reflect on the true meaning of the
Fourth of July. On this day in 1776, the Second Continental Congress
adopted the United States Declaration of Independence, marking the
beginning of Americas journey to become the greatest nation in the
world.
When I walk up the steps of our
Nations Capitol, I often stop and think about how it all began. The
America we live in today hasnt always been here. The American flag
hasnt always been a symbol of independence for the greatest country.
The Dream millions live today was a vision long ago. It started with
our Founding Fathers standing up against tyranny across the ocean and
demanding freedom. Numerous challenges over the past three centuries
could have taken our freedom, but each time courageous men and women
came together to protect our liberties, allowing us to celebrate our
freedom and prosperity
today.
Representing the Third District of Kansas gives me great pride and is a
humbling opportunity that wouldnt be possible without those the brave
warriors in the U.S. Armed Forces that sacrificed their lives fighting
to protect and preserve our freedom, and for that I am eternally
grateful. Today, we put aside political differences to remember the
sacrifices that came before us and celebrate our independence.
It is for these reasons that we
celebrate the 238th Anniversary of American Independence today. Please
have a safe and enjoyable Fourth of
July.
May God Bless
America!
