Congressional Report -- Week of March 10-14: Honoring Texas
Women
Hello Friend,
This was a special week for me. My wife and son, Mara Elena and
Nicols Miguel, spent the week in Washington, D.C., helping me welcome
the many Texans that visited our nation's capital during Spring Break.
I met with folks from San Antonio, Uvalde, Fair Oaks Ranch, Shavano
Park, Somerset and other communities in the 23rd. We gave constituents
tours of the Capitol and talked about the work of representing everyone
in the 23rd District of Texas. It was a fulfilling week - both
personally and professionally.
Field staff in Texas was also busy. Matt Hall met with veterans in Frio
and La Salle Counties. Cynthia Martinez attended a Veterans of Foreign
Wars meeting in Kinney County. Julie Morton attended the screening of
No Man's Land, a new TV show that recorded an episode in West Texas.
The show airs on Sundays on the History Channel. Here's a quick wrap up
of the week.

tenacious women who have fought and continue to fight to shape our
nation. I congratulate all women for their work as business owners,
medical doctors, teachers, police officers, engineers, moms and
spouses. To watch the video, click here

Uvalde High School Students Win C-SPAN Video Documentary Competition
Congratulations to Sarah Vasquez and Ramiro Rubio, seniors at Uvalde
High School in Uvalde, Texas, for winning Honorable Mention in C-SPAN's
national 2014 StudentCam competition. I am so proud that Sarah and
Ramiro took the initiative to participate in the program and remain
committed to helping all students in 23rd District of Texas reach their
educational and career goals. The students will receive $250 for their
documentary, "A Message to the U.S. Congress: Cyber Security in the
year 2014." Click here
to watch the documentary.
Sarah Vasquez and Ramiro Rubio of Uvalde High School won an Honorable
Mention from C-SPAN StudentCam for documentary on cybersecurity.
House Armed Services Committee Hearing on Sequestration and Budget
By reducing training for our Armed Forces, sequestration will continue
to risk the lives of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines - and it
will only get worse if Republicans and Democrats do not work together
to solve this crisis.
Last week, I participated in a House Armed Services Committee hearing
and directly asked General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, if reduced training is endangering our men and women in
uniform as they complete the missions we ask them to do. General
Dempsey's response: "I can give you a one word answer to that:' Yes.'"

Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.

fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
