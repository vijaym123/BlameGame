FROM THE DESK OF CONGRESSMAN YOHO
Friends,
Like you, I've been extremely troubled by many of the reports regarding
the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our servicemen and women, who have
sacrificed for their country and our freedoms, are being denied care
for extended periods of time. Some had to wait as long as 50 days
before they could see a doctor. Even more troubling, this misconduct is
not limited to one or two facilities; it is a nation-wide, systemic,
problem. Even our own Gainesville VA has had issues reported that, if
true, need to be addressed immediately.
On May 23rd, four Florida colleagues and I sent a letter to then
Secretary Shinseki
,
asking him to resign. We felt that it was a strong signal to show the
seriousness of these allegations and to set in motion much needed
systemic reforms. Ensuring that our veterans receive the care they need
should be the foundation upon which the entire organization is built.
I applaud Secretary Shinseki for his decision to resign and look
forward to a new Secretary who can change the culture of misconduct
that seems to have spread throughout the department. I am also
committed to helping our local VA facilities become the best in the
country. Our great District is home to approximately 122,000 veterans,
and they deserve the comfort of knowing they will be cared for with the
same integrity they showed us by answering the call of duty.
Those who have answered the call and became the tip of the spear,
deserve nothing less. President Abraham Lincoln, in his second
inaugural address, echoed this sentiment by saying, "let us strive on
to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds to care
for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his
orphan."
There is a sacred trust between a veteran and the nation they risked
their lives to protect. The country is forever in their debt. The
misconduct that has occurred at the VA broke that trust, and we owe it
to our veterans to ensure accountability and justice. Additionally, the
House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would hold
accountable senior officials at the VA
for their poor performance and blatant misconduct. This was
yet another important step in holding the VA accountable for their
egregious actions.
The House of Representatives is also looking at legislation that would
make it easier for our veterans to obtain care outside the VA to ensure
they are seen in a timely manner. Our veterans stood up when asked, we
as a country must do the same for them. As we continue to pass
legislation to honor our commitment to our veterans, rest assured I
will keep you informed.
Also, if you are a veteran and you need help with the VA, my office is
more than happy to assist you. I have a dedicated staff of constituent
advocates who would be glad to help in any way they can. You can either
call the Gainesville Office at 352-505-0838 or the Orange Park Office
at 904-276-9626. You can also begin the process by clicking here.
Best,
Ted

FROM
THE
DESK
OF
CONGRESSMAN
YOHO
Friends,
Like
you,
I&#8217;ve
been
extremely
troubled
by
many
of
the
reports
regarding
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
Our
servicemen
and
women,
who
have
sacrificed
for
their
country
and
our
freedoms,
are
being
denied
care
for
extended
periods
of
time.
Some
had
to
wait
as
long
as
50
days
before
they
could
see
a
doctor.
Even
more
troubling,
this
misconduct
is
not
limited
to
one
or
two
facilities;
it
is
a
nation-wide,
systemic,
problem.
Even
our
own
Gainesville
VA
has
had
issues
reported
that,
if
true,
need
to
be
addressed
immediately.
On
May
23 rd ,
four
Florida
colleagues
and
I
sent
a
letter
to
then
Secretary
Shinseki ,
asking
him
to
resign.
We
felt
that
it
was
a
strong
signal
to
show
the
seriousness
of
these
allegations
and
to
set
in
motion
much
needed
systemic
reforms.
Ensuring
that
our
veterans
receive
the
care
they
need
should
be
the
foundation
upon
which
the
entire
organization
is
built.
I
applaud
Secretary
Shinseki
for
his
decision
to
resign
and
look
forward
to
a
new
Secretary
who
can
change
the
culture
of
misconduct
that
seems
to
have
spread
throughout
the
department.
I
am
also
committed
to
helping
our
local
VA
facilities
become
the
best
in
the
country.
Our
great
District
is
home
to
approximately
122,000
veterans,
and
they
deserve
the
comfort
of
knowing
they
will
be
cared
for
with
the
same
integrity
they
showed
us
by
answering
the
call
of
duty.
Those
who
have
answered
the
call
and
became
the
tip
of
the
spear,
deserve
nothing
less.
President
Abraham
Lincoln,
in
his
second
inaugural
address,
echoed
this
sentiment
by
saying,
&#8220; let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in,
to
bind
up
the
nation's
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle,
and
for
his
widow
and
his
orphan.&#8221;
There
is
a
sacred
trust
between
a
veteran
and
the
nation
they
risked
their
lives
to
protect.
The
country
is
forever
in
their
debt.
The
misconduct
that
has
occurred
at
the
VA
broke
that
trust,
and
we
owe
it
to
our
veterans
to
ensure
accountability
and
justice.
Additionally,
the
House
of
Representatives
recently
passed
legislation
that
would
hold
accountable
senior
officials
at
the
VA
for
their
poor
performance
and
blatant
misconduct.
This
was
yet
another
important
step
in
holding
the
VA
accountable
for
their
egregious
actions.
The
House
of
Representatives
is
also
looking
at
legislation
that
would
make
it
easier
for
our
veterans
to
obtain
care
outside
the
VA
to
ensure
they
are
seen
in
a
timely
manner.
Our
veterans
stood
up
when
asked,
we
as
a
country
must
do
the
same
for
them.
As
we
continue
to
pass
legislation
to
honor
our
commitment
to
our
veterans,
rest
assured
I
will
keep
you
informed.
Also,
if
you
are
a
veteran
and
you
need
help
with
the
VA,
my
office
is
more
than
happy
to
assist
you.
