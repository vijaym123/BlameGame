Thats how long it takes the average American taxpayer to comply with the tax code, reading the rules, gathering receipts, and filling out all the forms required by the IRS.
Not only does this go against common sense, but the complexity of the current tax code also places a heavy burden on American families and small businesses, impacting their effectiveness and productivity. Read about my recent work to push for a simpler, fairer tax code
including supporting an optional flat tax and pushing to reform the entire code,

Yours in service,
Randy
