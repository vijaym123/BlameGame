Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn met with his Defense
Advisory Board at Boecore in Downtown Colorado Springs. Topics discussed
included defense budget issues, the next National Defense
Authorization Act, the sequestration issues facing FY 2016, and the Congressman's

Congressman also appreciated the opportunity to dialogue with and hear the
