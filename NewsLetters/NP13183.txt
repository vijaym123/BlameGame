Dear Friend,
As your voice in the halls of Congress, one of the obligations I take most seriously is taking care of our veterans. The brave men and women of our Armed Forces who volunteer to protect our freedoms deserve not only our respect, but also action from Congress that shows true appreciation for their sacrifices.
Shortly before Christmas, Congress passed a budget compromise bill that contained a provision that will reduce the cost-of-living increases for retired military personnel under the age of 62. This provision amounts to a $6 billion cut in military pensions. I voted against the budget compromise.
Chief among my reasons for opposing the bill is the change to military pensions. Simply put, it is wrong for Congress to try and balance the budget by breaking promises made to members of our nation&#39;s military.
Worse yet, military retirees are the only group affected by the budget compromise. Changes made to federal civilian retirement programs only apply to future federal civilian employees, not to current federal civilian employees. Cutting veteran&#39;s pensions, while funding pensions for civilian federal employees, is a slap in the face to members of our military and their families who have sacrificed so much while defending our freedoms at home and abroad.
Congress can find better ways to save money. I am cosponsoring H.R. 3788, which will repeal the changes to military retirement programs and replace those changes with a requirement that taxpayers provide a valid Social Security number in order to be eligible for tax refunds under the child tax credit. This loophole allows individuals, some of whom are in the country illegally, to fraudulently claim child tax credits. This reform will save roughly $7 billion over 10 years, which is more than the changes to military pensions are forecasted to save over the same time. This sensible step to stop fraud and abuse in the federal government is a much better option than cutting the pensions of military retirees.
Our men and women in uniform deserve unwavering support from every Member of Congress and all Americans. It is wrong to balance budgets on the backs of troops who voluntarily put themselves in harm&#39;s way so that we can all be free. I will continue efforts to restore veteran&#39;s pension benefits. The livelihood of our troops should not be negotiable.
OZARK NATIONAL SCENIC RIVERWAYS DRAFT MANAGEMENT PLAN PUBLIC MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT
I joined with Senators Blunt and McCaskill and Congresswoman Ann Wagner to ask the Park Service to postpone the public comment meeting for the draft General Management Plan for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.
With the extremely cold temperatures and dangerous road conditions, safety was a real issue. A new general management plan could have a huge impact on folks in our district and folks should have the opportunity to have their voices heard.
Thankfully, on Tuesday the Park Service granted my request to reschedule the public comment meetings. The meetings will be held:

THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
On Thursday, I joined my colleagues on the House Committee on Natural Resources for an oversight hearing titled Obama Administration&#39;s War on Coal: The Recent Report by the Office of the Inspector General." Unfortunately, the EPA is rejecting clean coal technology and issuing strict standards for new coal-fired electric generating plants. The new standards essentially guarantee no new coal-fired plants will be built. If we cannot use the reliable energy coal provides, lights across rural Missouri and all of rural America will be out. President Obamas new rules could increase the cost to build a new coal-fired power plant by over $1 billion. The $1 billion price tag makes new coal-fired power plants virtually unaffordable. At a time when Americas energy needs are increasing, the EPA should not stand in the way of building new power plants.

I spent much of Wednesday morning talking to radio outlets across the Eighth District about the new dates for public meetings on the draft General Management Plan for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. It is essential that we have good attendance at the meetings in Salem, Van Buren and Eminence.
Everyday I get many letters from folks across our Eighth District. I was honored to receive a note from Roy Robinson, a veteran from Farmington, who was in Washington recently on an Honor Flight Tour of the World War II and Korean War Memorials. It's a privilege to represent Mr. Robinson and all other veterans who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms.
On Thursday I participated in a hearing of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee on H.R. 7, the No Taxparyer Funding for Abortion Act. Taxpayer dollars should never be used to fund abortions. All life has value and the casual taking of life is morally wrong. The federal government should not spend one single dime on Planned Parenthood or any associated groups.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
