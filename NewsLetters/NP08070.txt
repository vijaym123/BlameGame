Hobby Lobby
decision.
In a blatantly partisan decision, the Supreme Court just ruled that certain employers can deny women workers access to birth control. That&rsquo;s not ok.

David -- this is seriously troubling.
Last week, in a 5-4 blatantly partisan decision, the Supreme Court gave some employers the authority to dictate women's healthcare choices. David, corporate bosses have no right to force their religious beliefs on workers, period.
That's why I'm joining my colleague Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth to denounce the Court&rsquo;s latest decision, and I urge you to join our call to action. Will you please click here to sign our petition to denounce the Supreme Court&rsquo;s latest
Hobby Lobby
decision?
I&rsquo;m running for reelection to put an end to the far right&rsquo;s extreme agenda against women&rsquo;s rights. David, I need you with me on this. Please sign our petition: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-For-Women
Thanks for taking action,
Brad
