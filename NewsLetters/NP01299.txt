Friend
Just a quick note
wanted to let you know I recently joined over 60 of my colleagues in the House in sending a letter calling for the end of taxpayer subsidies to organizations that provide abortions (like Planned Parenthood) in this years Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies funding bill. You can read the letter,
here.
I strongly believe that life is precious and deserves protection. As Congress considers healthcare reforms, I believe organizations that both provide comprehensive healthcare and respect all life are best equipped to offer the most effective healthcare services to those in need. I will continue to fight for the protection of innocent life and use my voice to advocate for the voiceless.
Yours in service,
Randy
