Update from Senator Bob

Corker Travels Across
Tennessee
Last week, Senator Corker visited several West Tennessee
counties to meet with Tennesseans and discuss what he believes are the three
main areas Congress must focus on in the year ahead: (1) how America
can strengthen its leadership role in the world; (2) how we can grow
the economy and help improve the standard of living for American
families; and (3) how we can put our country on sound fiscal footing by
reforming government spending, restructuring entitlement programs to make
them solvent and overhauling the tax code.
After
meeting with public health officials in Davidson County, Senator Corker
headed to Benton County where he held a roundtable discussion with
business and community leaders in Camden. Later, he chatted with diners at
the Country &amp; Western Steakhouse before stopping by Benton
County's United Way Good Neighbor Auction to thank volunteers and
congratulate them on another successful event. Corker ended the day in Linden
meeting with members of the Perry County Chamber and discussing some
of the ways we can grow the economy and address the challenges facing
our country.
The senator continued his travels across West
Tennessee last Wednesday, making stops in Madison, Chester and Fayette
counties. He began the day in Jackson, meeting with West Tennessee
mayors. Later, he spoke to students at Freed-Hardeman Universitys chapel
service where he talked about leadership, public service and the
importance of finding a way to give back to your community. Corker wrapped
the day in Fayette County, meeting with business and community
leaders at a luncheon hosted by the Fayette County Chamber of
Commerce.
Earlier this month, Senator Corker visited with Tennesseans in
Monroe, Loudon and Union counties.

U.S. and Other
Nations Must Accelerate Efforts to Stop Ebola Outbreak in West
Africa
Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, issued the following statement last week
after speaking with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
Administrator Rajiv Shah about the U.S. response to Ebola in West
Africa.
As we address this problem, the most important thing for
us to do is to contain and stop Ebola in West Africa, and for that
reason, I talked with Administrator Shah to receive an update on the U.S.
response there. I appreciate his efforts, and it is my understanding
the administration will be asking for additional congressional action
to enhance the U.S. response in West Africa. I look forward to seeing
the details of this plan. The U.S. and other nations must accelerate
the response to stop this fatal outbreak in a way that protects our
citizens and the people of West Africa. It is also important to address
the economic impact of Ebola in the affected countries, said
Corker.
On Monday, Senator Corker met with public health officials
and industry leaders in Tennessee to discuss the states preparedness
efforts on Ebola.
I have met with public health experts in
Tennessee, and while I believe it is essential that our health care
systems continue to work tirelessly to protect Americans at home, it is
clear to me that the way we win this battle is by fighting Ebola at its
source in West Africa and by aggressively scaling up the
international response, added Corker.
