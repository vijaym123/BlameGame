David,
I wanted to personally share the news. With just 8 hours to go until the deadline, we&rsquo;re only $3,251 short of hitting $125,000 for August and setting a new online record for this election!
That&rsquo;s an incredible showing, and it&rsquo;s all because of your incredible support. Thanks!
But David, we&rsquo;re not there yet. So what do you say? Join the party and chip in a few dollars before midnight. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/break-the-record
Thanks for your help!
