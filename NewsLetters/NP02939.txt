Friend
Just wanted to be sure you saw that the House voted 239-186 to completely repeal Obamacare this week, as well as to instruct several committees to create a replacement for the disastrous healthcare law
a replacement structured around the idea that
healthcare should not, and must not, come at the cost of crippling our economy and our job creators.
I will keep you posted.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. This week I also introduced my bill, Prevent IRS Overreach (H.R. 683), to prohibit the IRS from hiring new employees to enforce any provision of Obamacare. You can read the text of the legislation,
