We are completely out of ideas.
After Hillary Clinton emailed you this morning to ask for help, we really thought we would be in a better place.
But we aren't. The Koch Brothers are pummeling us spending millions against us. Republicans are spending $26 MILLION against us this week alone -- the most of the entire election. So big -- it doesn't even look like Hillary Clinton's email can dig us out of this hole.
There is still time, though. Things are rough, but we&rsquo;re not ready to accept defeat. If we can bring in 35,OOO donations before tomorrow&rsquo;s fundraising deadline, we can get back on track before Tuesday&rsquo;s election.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
Will you answer Hillary Clinton's call-to-action?
