HAPPY INDEPENDENCE
DAY!
July 4th is the 238th anniversary of the founding of our great
nation. It is also a wonderful time to gather family and friends, to
enjoy some great summertime company. I hope you will celebrate the
country's birthday this July 4th, and that you will do so responsibly and
safely. Remember that California is in a drought, so be careful
cooking outdoors with fire or playing with sparklers. Of course, firework
use without a permit is also illegal here in
California.

to find out
more from the L.A. Fire Department about how to have a wonderful, safe
July 4th weekend!
I also wanted to draw
your attention to a great resource I have just introduced. My office
created a Small Business Resource Guide to help Valley businesses
navigate red tape and take advantage of opportunities to grow.
The
guide provides information on federal, state and local resources for
small businesses.
It also provides information on creating
proposals for sales to the federal government.
The guide is available on my website . I invite you
to download it and find out how America can help your small
business!
