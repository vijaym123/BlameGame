Improving Our Tax System to Benefit You
Dear Friends,
The past week was a busy one in Washington, and as Tax Day passed last week we were all reminded that, as Benjamin Franklin said, theres nothing certain in this world except death and taxes.
While taxes may be certain, it is my priority to ensure your hard-earned tax dollars are not wasted here in Washington. Just last week I supported several measures to reduce your tax burden and move our system to one that is more fair and easier on your pocketbook. Between energy costs, skyrocketing tuition prices, and just putting food on the table, I know Texas families have a lot on their financial platesjust know Im here in Washington, fighting for you and Im committed to improving our tax system in a way that benefits your family.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
Member of Congress
Check out this graphic on the history of the Income Tax, and read below what Ive been up to in the last week to make sure YOUR taxes are fairer.
Just this week I supported:
Repeal of the Death Tax
The Death Repeal Act of 2015 repeals the federal estate tax, which would keep families from having to pay taxes on their inheritance after a death. The way the current law exists, up to 40% of a deceased family members estate can be taken as part of this taxand thats just not right. When a loved one dies, the last thing someone should be worried about is burdensome taxes while theyre grieving, and thats why I strongly supported the repeal of this tax.
Level the Playing Field for Taxpayers
I voted to make the State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act permanent last week, simplifying the tax system and leveling the playing field for taxpayers in different states. Doing your taxes is already stressful, without having different rules every year. Making this important tax deduction permanent give Texas taxpayers and businesses the certainty they deserve.
Taxpayer Bill of Rights
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2015 which I strongly supported passed the House last week. It outlines the rights taxpayers have, including the right to be informed, to be assisted, to be heard, and to pay no more than the correct amount of tax. The Bill of Rights also ensures Texas taxpayers have the right to privacy and confidentiality, and most of all a fair and just tax system.
Access to Mortgages for Low and Middle-Income Families
Home ownership is part of the American Dream, and its a priority of mine to preserve the option for Texans to purchase a home, and reduce any unnecessary red tape, barriers and bureaucracies that make that more difficult. Because of these priorities, last week I voted for the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015 to change the definition of a high cost mortgage to ensure Texans have access to affordable manufactured housing.
Keeping Your Confidential Information Confidential
When you pay your taxes or apply for a mortgage you should be able to do so with the assurance that your personal information will remain confidential. Last week the House passed the SAFE Act Confidentiality and Privilege Enhancement Act to provide confidentiality protections to consumers when applying for a mortgage, and ensure financial services regulators accessing information in the national mortgage licensing and registry system are doing so without subjecting the consumers personal records to weakened privacy and confidentiality provisions.
Holding Federal Employees and Contractors Accountable
This week I voted for two bills, the Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015 and the Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015, which ensure federal employees and contractors are barred from employment or contracts if they have seriously delinquent federal tax debts.
