The ditch next to your house could cost you $270,000
This week I joined the House of Representatives in passing the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Prevention Act, legislation that would reject the EPAs new definition of navigable waters under the Clean Water Act.
Are you a landowner with a ditch, pond or seasonal wet area on your property?
This regulation could impact you.
Since 1972, the EPA has had jurisdiction over navigable waters within the U.S. However, the agency has announced an expansion of this authority that could force virtually all land owners with any water on their land to apply and pay for a clean water permit.
The economic impact this would have on individuals, small businesses, cities and counties would be severe. A Clean Water Act permit costs on average $270,000 and takes 788 days to obtain. Penalties for violation of the Clean Water Act can be up to $37,500 per day.
This is a very serious issue that Ive heard about from folks across Southwest Washington, from those who own land to those who are currently constructing a new building or making other improvements. Without this legislation, the result will be harm to small business owners, higher food prices and a significant restriction on what people can do with their own land.
