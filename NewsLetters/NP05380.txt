ANSWERED NANCY PELOSI'S CALL-TO-ACTION? ## NO DONATION ## Don't worry -- there's still time! Click below to chip in.
------------ Please take 30 seconds to read this:
-- Republicans are spending an astonishing $6 MILLION against Brad Schneider
-- every piece of data shows his race in a DEAD HEAT
-- and he&rsquo;s in serious danger of falling behind David, this is it:
the election is just 18 days away and we&rsquo;re running out of time to close the gap.
Sadly, if we fall behind now, there won&rsquo;t be enough time to catch up.
So we have to get going.
David -- stop what you&rsquo;re doing, chip in for Brad, and help stop a GOP takeover in Illinois. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I refuse to wake up the day after the election with any regrets, wishing we had done more for Brad when we had the chance.
So if you can -- please step up right now -- before it&rsquo;s too late: http://action.schneiderforcongress.com/donate-here
best,
