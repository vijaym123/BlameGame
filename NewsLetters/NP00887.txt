Our Nation
was founded on the principle of religious liberty and freedom of expression. I
believe that every individual regardless of religion should have the
opportunity to practice his or her religion without fear of discrimination or
retribution.
Furthermore, the United
States should stand as leader to advance and promote the ideas of religious
liberty across the world. Therefore, this past month I cosponsored H.R. 1150,
the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2015.
This bill would seek to improve the ability
of the United States to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced
diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts, and
through stronger and more flexible political responses to religious freedom
violations.
As your Member of Congress,
I pledge to never support the persecution of any faith and work with my colleagues
to ensure the protection of religious liberty.
