Dear Friends,
Over the next few months, the General Assembly will be crafting a budget for next year. As you know, Illinois faces many fiscal challenges, requiring us to evaluate all state spending.
I am hosting two Budget Town Hall events
over the next few weeks giving you the opportunity to learn more about our budget process and weigh in on the challenges we all face.
The first event will be held this Thursday at Prairie State College in Chicago Heights at 6:30 p.m. Next Wednesday, April 8, I am hosting a second event at the Kankakee Public Library.
During these events, Ralph Martire with the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability will give a budget presentation on where we stand and the difficulties we face. You will have the opportunity to ask questions after the presentation.
I look forward to seeing you! If you cannot make one of these events and would like to weigh in on the budget,
please do not hesitate to contact me . For more information on these events,

Sincerely,
Senator Toi Hutchinson
