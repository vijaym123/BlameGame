Receding coastlines. Harsher flooding. Poorer air quality.
Floridians have long known about the threats posed by climate change. What we didn't know was how far our Governor would go to avoid addressing this profound threat.
We now know that Governor Rick Scott actually banned officials from our Department of Environmental Protection from using words like "climate change" and "global warming," thanks to a recent report by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting.
If you oppose efforts to deny the science of climate change, will you join me on Twitter by retweeting #DontCensorScience?
Unfortunately, efforts to discredit science are underway in Congress too.
Today House Majority passed the "EPA Science Advisory Reform Act," and later this week, the "Secret Science Reform Act." These bills would force the EPA to ignore scientific evidence on mercury, lead, carbon, and other kinds of pollution and place sham scientists bankrolled by special interests in top advisory roles at the agency.
For the sake of our health, our environment, our economy, and our children, we must condemn efforts to silence scientists and stand up for real action on global climate change.
