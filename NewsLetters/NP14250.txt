News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
November 11, 2013
Dear friends,
Nearly 100 years ago, President Woodrow Wilson declared that November
11 would be set aside to remember the veterans who fought and died in
the First World War. He said
that it would be a day, "filled with
solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service
and with gratitude for the victory." In 1954, Congress amended the day
of remembrance to include all veterans. Since then, we have taken time
each November 11 to reflect on all the blessings our veterans have
given us through their sacrifices.
How will you honor veterans today? I started the day with a ceremony at
Abilene Christian University, in which we gave thanks for our veterans
and offered prayers for our troops. This afternoon, I had the
tremendous honor of presenting the Purple Heart and Bronze Star to the
family of PFC Francisco J. Loza. Mr. Loza served as an Infantryman with
the U.S. 36th Infantry Division's 3rd Battalion, Company I, 142nd
Infantryman Regiment during World War II. He earned a handful of
medals, which were never presented to him. His family approached my
office, and by working with friends, family, and veterans advocates, we
were able to obtain the awards Mr. Loza had earned.
Providing services like these for our veterans is one of the greatest
privileges of my job. We're able to help with big and small jobs. This
summer, we were able to help replace an Air Force pilot's helmet. The
pilot's helmet was stolen at the end of his service, and he's always
missed having it as a keepsake. This Christmas, his son plans to
surprise him by giving him an exact replacement.
We also work tirelessly to help veterans receive the benefits they've
earned from their service. Navigating the necessary paperwork can be
complicated, but my staff can guide you through it and help speed up
the process. If you need assistance with VA benefits, visit my website
or call toll-free at
866-763-1611.
Access to health care is another important issue for veterans. We work
closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that our
veterans receive the best care possible at the Big Spring Veterans
Hospital. We're also working to facilitate discussions between Texas
Tech and the VA about building a new facility for the Lubbock VA
Outpatient Clinic on the Texas Tech campus. This will provide local
veterans with the best quality, state-of-the-art medical care.
Providing these services to our veterans is the very least we can do to
pay them back for all they've done for us. This Veterans Day, I hope
you'll join me in honoring all the brave men and women who have fought
to defend our country, our people, and our freedoms.
May God bless them, and may He continue to bless the United States of
America.

Dear
friends,
Nearly
100
years
ago,
President
Woodrow
Wilson
declared
that
November
11
would
be
set
aside
to
remember
the
veterans
who
fought
and
died
in
the
First
World
War.
He
said
that
it
would
be
a
day,
&#8220;filled
with
solemn
pride
in
the
heroism
of
those
who
died
in
the
country&#8217;s
service
and
with
gratitude
for
the
victory.&#8221; In
1954,
Congress
amended
the
day
of
remembrance
to
include
all
veterans. Since
then,
we
have
taken
time
each
November
11
to
reflect
on
all
the
blessings
our
veterans
have
given
us
through
their
sacrifices.
How
will
you

veterans
today? I
started
the
day
with
a

Abilene

in
which
we
gave

I
had
the
tremendous
honor
of
presenting
the
Purple
Heart
and
Bronze
Star
to
the
family
of
PFC

Mr.

served
as
an

earned
a

were
never

and
by
working
with

we
were

obtain
the

Mr.

had
earned.

you&#8217;ll

honoring
all
the
brave
men

women
who
have
fought
to
defend
our
country,
our
people,
and
our
freedoms.
May
God
bless
them,
and
may
He
continue
to
bless
the
United
States
of
America.
