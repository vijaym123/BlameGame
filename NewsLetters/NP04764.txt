Are You Better
Off?
Attempting to channel President
Reagan, that's a question that President Obama recently asked the
American people. The response he got via a
Washington
Post/ABC News poll
just a few days later was
devastatin g .
Americans, across the board, answered with
a
decided no . In fact, only
22%
were willing
to say they were better off, and amongst Democrats, only
37%
said they were better off after 6 years of the President's
policies.
I know you're not surprised and might even agree
with the
30%
who said they were
worse
off
than before. And there's little question why we feel this
way. The President's health care law has caused many to lose the plan
they had and liked,
pay higher premiums and
deductibles , and lose access to the doctor they know and trust.
The President's
economic policies have created the
worst economic recovery
since WWII. The number of people who have dropped out of the job
market and stopped looking for work is at a
historic low .
Wages are
stagnant
and families are missing over
$1,000
in their monthly paychecks due to taxes and regulations.
Families are facing increased costs for
groceries, childcare and
education .
In fact, the only good news lately is that
prices are down at the pump, and that's because of the
amazing
American energy boom
happening on private lands. The President
continues to thwart efforts to expand exploration and drilling on
government lands, and after over more than six years, he still refuses to
approve the
job-creating,
doesn't-cost-a-dime-of-taxpayer-dollars , Keystone XL Pipeline.
It doesn't
have to be this way. House Republicans have fought tooth and nail to
rein in runaway spending and stop tax increases, but there's so much more
we can do. Republicans have a
plan
to spur
job creation
and
economic growth
and
we're ready to work with Senate Republicans to put it in
place.
Together, we will work to make government
more
accountable, more efficient and more effective . We can rein in Washington
by lowering tax rates, slashing red tape and closing down redundant
government agencies. We will continue to investigate and hold
accountable federal agencies like the IRS and the VA. We will make defeating
the terrorists that want to destroy the American way of life a
priority.
We will demand approval of Keystone from the White House and
we will
dismantle the worse piece of legislation that's ever come
out of Washington
-
the President's 'Un'Affordable Care
Act
- and pass real, cost-cutting, patient-centered health care
reform.
Our plan boils down to one simple statement -
Less money and power for Washington, and more prosperity and
liberty for the American people.
For the first time in our history,
many parents believe that their children
will not
be better off
than they are, but I believe that it's not too late to restore the
American Dream
and ensure the next generation has even
better opportunities than we had.
That is what I fight
for,
every single day , as your representative
in Washington. Your kids, and my kids, deserve no less.
