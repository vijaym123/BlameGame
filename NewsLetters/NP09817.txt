Dear Friend,
This past Monday, we received the unfortunate news that Billy Frank
Jr., the Chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, passed
away. Billy was a larger than life presence in our region. He was a
fixture and if you saw him speak once it's something you won't soon
forget. The Pacific Northwest - and America - lost a true legend.
Billy's legacy on civil rights issues, on ensuring America lives up to
its tribal treaty obligations, and protecting our natural resources has
touched generations past and present.
When Billy spoke you listened. I saw that firsthand recently when he
commanded a room that included tribal leaders, federal officials, and
the Secretary of the Interior. I saw it when our Ranking Member on the
House Natural Resources Committee visited and Billy explained to him
the importance of salmon recovery and of protecting Puget Sound.
There is a Native American proverb that says we should make decisions
with an eye toward how they would affect our children seven generations
into the future. Billy Frank was an embodiment of that ethos. Click
here
to see my speech in Billy Frank Jr.'s memory on the House
floor earlier today.
Since my last update, I held my sixth telephone town hall. I work for
you and I always enjoy hearing from folks about the issues important to
them and how we can keep our region moving forward. I also have a
couple exciting developments to share regarding initiatives my staff
and I have been working on here in D.C. on a big defense bill and
prize-linked savings accounts. On to the news....
National Defense Authorization Act Mark-Up
This week the House Armed Services Committee took up the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Basically, this
legislation sets funding levels, expenditures, and other authorizations
for the Department of Defense. The bill that passed out of committee
includes important provisions for our national security and critical
investments for the United States Navy. It also includes many
initiatives that I pushed for, including efforts to encourage the use
of innovative timber products by the military and to make coordination
easier for cyber and information technology ranges in the Department of
Defense (DOD), among other items.
We talk a lot about partisan logjams in Congress but I'm happy to note
that this defense bill passed committee unanimously. It's not every day
that an important bill gets this kind of broad support from both
Democrats and Republicans. There were some tough decisions about our
budget and national security but in the end we came together to agree
on a path forward. The bill still has a ways to go-next up is
consideration by the full House of Representatives-but I'm encouraged
by our start.
This bipartisan bill helps ensure we have the best trained and equipped
fighting force in the world, while honoring our commitment to the men
and women who serve and their families. This legislation supports our
continued pivot to Asia and makes the needed investments to ensure that
the Navy continues to play a key role in that mission. I was
particularly proud to work with my colleagues to maintain a fleet of 11
aircraft carriers while fully funding the Ohio-class submarine
replacement.
These are not the only reasons this bill is so important to our region.
There are also crucial investments to strengthen our local military
installations. Given the pressure on our national budgets, we have to
be smart in preparing our region so that if another round of base
closures comes down the pike, our region will have a secure place in
helping the military continue its national security mission. That's why
I was pleased the bill included investments in water treatment systems
at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, the continued construction of the
explosives handling wharf at Naval Base Kitsap Bangor, and improvements
to the Navy's Forward Operation Location in Port Angeles.
The bill that passed also included my call for the Department of
Defense to utilize innovative building materials, such as
Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT), for construction. The use of CLT could
help reduce future building costs, improve environmental impact,
strengthen structures in the face of seismic disturbances, and create a
new market for our nation's timber industry.
As discussion continues on this bill, I'm proud to fight for provisions
that provide needed support for the Navy and the rest of our nation's
military, maximize our cyber capabilities to boost defense and jobs,
and encourage the military to invest in innovative timber products. In
the months ahead we will debate this on the House floor and I will push
for these and other measures so we end up with a bill that protects our
national security and America's taxpayers.
Prize-Linked Savings Initiative Highlighted as Innovative Idea by
National Nonprofit Organization
Many Americans aren't saving enough to be prepared for what life can
throw at them - a lost job, a medical emergency, or even a broken water
heater. Whether someone is buying a house or figuring out how to pay
for school, it can be valuable to have the savings to get closer to
that goal.
In my past newsletters I've shared with you that I've sponsored a bill
to allow financial institutions to provide prize-linked savings
accounts. These accounts would enable people to win cash prizes while
they save.
Numerous studies have shown that these accounts work. They encourage
people to save more money. The best thing that can happen is you win
significant financial prizes. The worst thing that can happen is that
you've saved money.
And now more affirmation for this idea! Prize-linked savings accounts
were named a "top impact innovation" over the past 10 years by the
Center of Financial Services Innovation. I am glad to see recognition
for something that I believe is so important for the future of our
nation's financial health. The bill I introduced last month, the
American Savings Promotion Act, seeks to help reverse a decline in
Americans' personal savings rates by allowing more financial
institutions to offer prize-linked savings accounts. It's not a new
government program; rather, just a way for financial institutions to
provide an innovative product to help folks save money. That's why the
bill is getting strong bipartisan support.

A Shout-out to Teacher Appreciation Week
As the son of two teachers (one retired and one in his 48th year), and
as the father of two daughters, I want to take a moment to recognize
Teacher Appreciation Week. I embrace the adage that Benjamin Franklin
wrote two and a half centuries ago: "An investment in knowledge pays
the greatest interest."
As it so happens, I hosted a Seniors Resource Forum in Port Angeles on
Friday - and I ran into my third grade teacher, Mrs. Cornette!
I also saw my 8th grade shop teacher, Mr. Reed. Thanks so much to those
two great teachers -- and to all the great folks who attended our
Seniors Forum.
It's an Honor to Represent You
That's it for this week. Thanks as always for reading and don't
hesitate to reach out if I or my office can be helpful to you.
I'm honored to work for you. And to all the moms out there -- Happy
Mothers' Day!
Sincerely,
Derek Kilmer

Dear
Friend,
This
past
Monday,
we
received
the
unfortunate
news
that
Billy
Frank

the
Chairman
of
the
Northwest
Indian
Fisheries
Commission,
passed

Billy

The

and
America
&#8211;
lost
a

Billy's

on

on
ensuring
America
lives
up
to
its
tribal
treaty

and

When

you

I

Billy

I&#8217;m

This

Asia
and
makes
the
needed

to
ensure
that
the

continues
to
play
a

These
are
not

only
reasons
this

is
so
important
to

There
are
also
crucial
investments
to

Given
the

so
that
if
another

the
pike,
our

will
have
a
secure
place
in
helping
the
military
continue
its
national

mission.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
pleased
the
bill
included
investments
in
water
treatment
systems
at
Puget
Sound
Naval
Shipyard,
the
continued
construction
of
the
explosives
handling
wharf
at
Naval
Base
Kitsap
Bangor,
and
improvements
to
the
Navy&#8217;s
Forward
Operation
Location
in
Port

The
bill
that
passed
also
included
my
call
for
the
Department
of
Defense
to
utilize
innovative
building
materials,
such
as
Cross-Laminated
Timber
(CLT),
for
construction.
The
use
of
CLT
could
help
reduce
future
building
costs,
improve
environmental
impact,
strengthen
structures
in
the
face
of
seismic
disturbances,
and
create
a
new
market
for
our
nation&#8217;s
timber
industry.
As
discussion
continues
on
this
bill,
I&#8217;m
proud
to
fight
for
provisions
that
provide
needed
support
for
the
Navy
and
the
rest
of
our
nation&#8217;s
military,
maximize
our
cyber
capabilities
to
boost
defense
and
jobs,
and
encourage
the
military
to
invest
in
innovative
timber
products.
In
the
months
ahead
we
will
debate
this
on
the
House
floor
and
I
will
push
for
these
and
other
measures
so
we
end
up
with
a
bill
that
protects
our
national
security
and
America's
taxpayers.
Prize-Linked
Savings
Initiative
Highlighted
as
Innovative
Idea
by
National

Many
Americans
aren&#8217;t
saving
enough
to
be
prepared
for
what
life
can
throw
at
them
&#8211;
a
lost
job,
a
medical
emergency,
or
even
a
broken
water
heater.
Whether
someone
is
buying
a
house
or
figuring
out
how
to
pay
for
school,
it
can
be
valuable
to
have
the
savings
to
get
closer
to
that
goal.
In
my
past

I've
shared
with
you
that
I've
sponsored
a

The

is
that
you&#8217;ve

And
now
more
affirmation
for
this
idea! Prize-linked
savings
accounts
were
named
a
&#8220;top

over
the

by
the

I

to
see
recognition
for
something
that
I
believe
is
so
important
for
the
future
of
our
nation&#8217;s
financial
health.
The
bill
I
introduced
last
month,
the
American
Savings
Promotion
Act,
seeks
to
help
reverse
a
decline
in
Americans&#8217;
personal
savings
rates
by
allowing
more
financial

prize-linked
savings

not
a

rather,
just
a

to
help

the
