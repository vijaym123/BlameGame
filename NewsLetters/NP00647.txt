Bomstad of Siloam Springs, the Arkansas Society of CPAs, John and
Nobie
Buzbee of Eureka Springs, the Arkansas March of Dimes, John Bratcher
of Little Rock, the Arkansas Rural Letter Carriers' Association, Rex
Cayer of Little Rock, the Arkansas Association of Insurance and
Financial Advisors, Mary Kate Snow of Bryant, the Arkansas Radiological
Society, Lincoln Middle School Principal Michele Price, Jana Claybrook of
Lincoln, Patrick Curry of Fayetteville, the Fayetteville High School
Choir, and Dr. Omar Atiq of Pine Bluff. Safe travels, and hope to see
you again soon!
On Tuesday, the House passed the Legislative
Branch Appropriations Act of 2016 ( H.R. 2250 ) by a vote of 357-67 ( Roll Call #247 ).
H.R. 2250 provides $3.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for
operations of the Legislative Branch (excluding Senate operations),
including funding of member representational allowances (MRAs), House
committees, Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the
Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), Library
of Congress (LOC), Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the
Government Accountability Office (GAO).
The bill provides the same
amount of funding as the Fiscal Year 2015 enacted level and $172.3 million
below the President's request.
Funding for the House of
Representatives has been reduced by 14 percent since the Republicans gained
the House majority in 2011.
In addition to H.R.
2250, the House also passed the Highway and Transportation Funding Act
of 2015 ( H.R. 2353 )on Tuesday by
a vote of 387-35 ( Roll Call
#249 ). H.R. 2353 extends the programmatic and expenditure authority
of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through July 31, 2015. Safe and
reliable transportation infrastructure is essential for sustained economic
growth in Arkansas, and I will continue to advocate for a long-term
solution for our highways. Piecemeal funding is inadequate and
unacceptable, but we mustnt allow our roads and bridges to crumble while we
work towards returning solvency and dependability to the Highway Trust
Fund once and for all. As such, I supported extending Highway Trust
Fund authority through the end of July, preventing a critical
interruption in transportation investment as we work to finalize a larger
agreement. The HTF currently has sufficient resources to fund its obligations
through this period.
On Wednesday, the House passed the America COMPETES Act
( H.R.
1806 ) by a vote of 217-205 ( Roll Call #258 ). H.R. 1806 authorizes funding
for specified research and education programs and grants totaling
approximately $33 billion over the fiscal year 2016 to 2020 period. It
reauthorizes civilian research programs in the National Science Foundation
(NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
Department of Energy (DOE), and the Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP). This bill prioritizes basic research with targeted
investments while staying within the caps enacted into law by the
Budget Control Act. The bill also establishes a "national interest"
standard for federal research grants at the NSF and expands the definition
of STEM education to include computer science.
The House also passed
the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 ( H.R. 880 ) on
Wednesday by a vote of 274-145 ( Roll Call #260 ). H.R. 4438 establishes a
permanent
simplified formula for calculating the research tax
credit. Moreover, this legislation continues the rule that allows taxpayers
to claim a reduced research credit if the taxpayer has no qualified
research expenses over the three preceding tax years and increases this
credit from six percent to ten percent. Additionally, the bill
allows qualified small businesses with $50 million or less in gross
receipts to claim these tax credits against Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
liability. H.R. 880 would be effective for qualifying amounts paid and
incurred after December 31, 2014.
Finally, on Thursday, the
House passed the SPACE Act of 2015 ( H.R. 2262 ) by a vote of 284-133
( Roll Call
#262 ). H.R. 2262 facilitates a pro-growth environment for the developing
commercial space industry by encouraging private sector investment,
creating more stable and predictable regulatory conditions, and improving
safety. Specifically, the bill reaffirms the Federal Aviation
Administration's (FAA) ability to regulate to protect the uninvolved public in
the event of an accident or unplanned event, establishes a process
for developing a safety framework outside of the regulatory process that
can more rapidly address safety concerns without implementing
arbitrary regulation and red tape, provides a long-term extension of the
third party liability risk-sharing regime to keep American space
companies internationally competitive, closes loopholes that leave
spaceflight participants vulnerable to financial ruin for participating in
commercial human spaceflight, provides flexibility in the experimental
permitting and licensing regimes to allow for rapid improvements in
safety and reliability systems, and affirms Congresss commitment to
the development of the commercial space industry.
In observance of Memorial Day and to honor the great
American heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms,
the House will not be in session next week. We owe no greater debt than
to these brave men and women in uniform who put themselves in harms
way to defend liberty. I have the utmost admiration and respect for
our veterans, and I am forever grateful for their unwavering
heroism.
From the Front...
