A Day to Give Thanks
Dear David,
When my grandparents settled in Big Sandy, they didn't have much.
They had hopes and dreams and some land that wasn't much more than grass.
But even so, they started a farm that has lasted for generations. Montana has been good to us, and I am grateful my grandparents picked Montana.
When Sharla and I gather with our family tomorrow, we'll be thankful for our rich history and the blessings we share. Personally, I am a proud and lucky husband, father and grandfather.
And I am honored to be your U.S. Senator.
But Thanksgiving is also a day to support others.
I encourage all Montanans to donate their time or good fortune to a charity.
Even a small gesture for a friend down on their luck can make a difference this holiday season.
I also encourage families to remember the thousands of American service members spending Thanksgiving away from home as they serve our nation around the world.
Supporting others is the Montana way.
As Montanans, we value our freedoms and our lands, but we also value our families and our communities.
And we value the opportunity to make better lives for ourselves and those we care about.
That's why I fight to make it easier for a worker to start a small business or go back to school to get a degree.
It's why I fight to preserve our public lands and increase access to high-quality health care.
And it's why I fight to ensure all Montanans have the chance to fulfill their dreams.
As 2015 approaches, I am grateful for the opportunity to work for you here in Montana and in Washington, D.C.
On Thanksgiving, I hope each of us takes a moment to think about what we are grateful for.
And I hope we all get to enjoy a relaxing day with family and friends.
Be well and stay in touch,
