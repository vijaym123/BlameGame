Dear Friend,
The United States has the responsibility to take an active role in
protecting human rights and promoting peace and democracy throughout
the world as a global leader. We recognize that all people have the
inherent right to basic personal freedoms and liberties.
Our nation provides economic, political and military assistance to
other countries for national security and humanitarian reasons.
By
participating in peacekeeping operations, addressing human rights
abuses, and promoting economic development, the United States plays a
critical role in addressing challenges facing communities throughout
the world.
This week, I had the chance to speak up for human rights around the
world from calling for targeted sanctions in Venezuela and ensuring
sanctions in North Korea are enforced, as well as highlighting human
rights abuses in China.
As a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I offered an
amendment during the consideration of the North Korea Sanctions
Enforcement Act of 2014 (H.R. 1771), which was adopted unanimously by
the Committee. Recently, a United Nations panel recommended that the
international community must significantly improve enforcement of
existing Resolutions, particularly relating to cargo inspections at air
and sea ports.
Recognizing that there are enforcement gaps, my
amendment urges the United States to strengthen the capacity of
responsible nations to monitor and intercept shipments to and from
North Korea that provide them cash, as well as technology and material
for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
I also spoke on the House floor in support of H. Res. 599, urging the
Government of the People's Republic of China to respect the freedom of
assembly, expression, religion, and all fundamental human rights of its
citizens, in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations. Watch part of my remarks below:
Congress plays an important role in authorizing and funding foreign
assistance programs and safeguarding democratic values.
I look forward
to continuing to speak up for human rights around the world as part of
my duties in Congress and on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
Join Me....

By

the

TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,

to
any
individual

and
it
will
take
priority
over
the

COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook

a

COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"

both

stripped

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between

that
otherwise
should
be

below
in

COMMENT:
You
can,
however,
stack
shorter
tables

and
avoid

Dear
Friend,
The
United
States
has
the
responsibility
to
take
an
active
role
in
protecting
human
rights
and
promoting
peace
and
democracy
throughout
the
world
as
a
global
leader. We
recognize
that
all
people
have
the
inherent
right
to
basic
personal
freedoms
and
liberties.
Our
nation
provides
economic,
political
and
military
assistance
to
other
countries
for
national
security
and
humanitarian
reasons.
By
participating
in
peacekeeping
operations,
addressing
human
rights
abuses,
and
promoting
economic
development,
the
United
States
plays
a
critical
role
in
addressing
challenges
facing
communities
throughout
the
world.
This
week,
I
had
the
chance
to
speak
up
for
human
rights
around
the
world
from
calling
for
targeted
sanctions
in
Venezuela
and
ensuring
sanctions
in
North
Korea
are
enforced,
as
well
as
highlighting
human
rights
abuses
in
China.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Committee
on
Foreign
Affairs,
I
offered
an
amendment
during
the
consideration
of
the
North
Korea
Sanctions
Enforcement
Act
of
2014
(H.R.
1771),
which
was
adopted
unanimously
by
the
Committee.
Recently,
a
United
Nations
panel
recommended
that
the
international
community
must
significantly
improve
enforcement
of
existing
Resolutions,
particularly
relating
to
cargo
inspections
at
air
and
sea
ports.
Recognizing
that
there
are
enforcement
gaps,
my
amendment
urges
the
United
States
to
strengthen
the
capacity
of
responsible
nations
to
monitor
and
intercept
shipments
to
and
from
North
Korea
that
provide
them
cash,
as
well
as
technology
and
material
for
its
nuclear
and
ballistic
missile
programs.
I
also
spoke
on
the
House
floor
in
support
of
H.
Res.
599,
urging
the
Government
of
the
People&#8217;s
Republic
of
China
to
respect
the
freedom
of
assembly,
expression,
religion,
and
all
fundamental
human
rights
of
its
citizens,
in
commemoration
of
the
25th
anniversary
of
the
Tiananmen
Square
demonstrations.
Watch
part
of
my
remarks
below:
Congress
plays
an
important
role
in
authorizing
and
funding
foreign
assistance
programs
and
safeguarding
democratic
values.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
speak
up
for
human
rights
around
the
world
as
part
of
my
duties
in
Congress
and
on
the
House
Committee
on
Foreign
Affairs.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
