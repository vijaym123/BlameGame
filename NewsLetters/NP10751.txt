VIDEO: Griffin Urges Obama: Do the Right Thing for Our
Environment and the Right Thing for American Workers
WATCH: Tim speaks on the House floor
Recently, several former Obama Administration officials have come out in support of building the Keystone XL pipeline project. But President Obama continues to block it.
It's been more than two years since President Obama first rejected the Keystone pipeline, and more than five years after the application to build it was first submitted to the State Department.
The government's latest environmental analysis of the project showed very clearly that it will have little environmental impact, provide much-needed jobs, and contribute $3.4 billion to our economy.
Hardworking Americans are ready for a real, all-of-the-above energy strategy. They need jobs. Imagine how many folks could get paychecks because of this project.
I understand that some folks are worried about protecting the environment and making sure our families and children have clean water to drink. I am too. So let's not argue over settled science. Research released last year from the National Academy of Sciences concludes that the oil sands crude Keystone will transport is no more corrosive than other crude oils and does not increase the risk of leaks.
We all saw what happened when a train carrying oil in Canada derailed last July. Most of an entire town was obliterated and nearly 50 people were killed. That was tragic and devastating. We know that pipelines are safer than trains or trucks.
The solution is clear: We need to improve and modernize our pipeline infrastructure. President Obama and Secretary Kerry should do the right thing for our environment and the right thing for American workers. Lets create jobs. Lets build Keystone now.
