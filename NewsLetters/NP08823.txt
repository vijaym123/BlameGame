Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
With the recent reports of delayed care for veterans resulting in dozens of untimely deaths, I visited this week all the local clinics that serve Congressional district 10 this week. The purpose was to see firsthand the level of care being provided to Central Florida veterans. I also visited with veterans in the waiting rooms and shared how they could contact me if they, or a veteran they know, ever needed assistance resolving a delay in services or care from the VA.
With my support the House has swiftly passed legislative reforms to get the VA back on track, but our work is far from finished. The Senate and Administration should take up without delay these and any forthcoming reform proposals aimed at holding VA officials accountable and ensuring veterans are effectively and efficiently cared for.

This past week was the end of the high school graduation season, and I was invited to attend and participate in the commencement exercise of West Orange High School, Orange Countys largest and best performing graduation class. I wish them great success as they continue to learn, follow after their dreams and inspire others to do the same.

Recently, I went to Oak Ridge High School to receive an update on the impact that CityYear Orlando is having in the six Orange County Public Schools where they are involved. As part of the AmeriCorps, CityYear is an education-focused nonprofit organization that works in 25 cities across the United States to address the national dropout crisis.
This week, I had the privilege of speaking at CityYear Orlandos Second Annual Graduation ceremony for 60 young people who dedicated this past year to mentoring students in Orange County.

Over the last few weeks, the Orlando Breakfast Rotary Club has been focused on the current state of transportation on both a local and national level. On Tuesday, I provided them with an update on federal transportation issues and how smart investments in infrastructure improvements will generate economic growth and provide a greater path to success in our Central Florida economy.
Other community events that I participated in and local businesses that I visited this week included:
-	Sir Speedy Printing and Marketing Services small business
-	Matthews Hope Ribbon Cutting in Winter Garden
-	16th Annual Family Caf for children with disabilities
-	Throwing out the opening pitch for the Florida Collegiate Summer League at the Winter Garden Squeeze home game.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
For over a year, my office has been assisting a constituent with his immigration process, and monitoring the claim he submitted to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This week, it was a pleasure to join Mr. Stephen Roberts for his citizenship ceremony and witness as he swore allegiance to the United States. I was honored to welcome Mr. Roberts as a new citizen of the greatest country in the world.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available to assist any constituent in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Bypassing the requirement to give 30 days notice to Congress before releasing detainees from Guantanamo, President Obama recently negotiated the exchange of five hardened Taliban commanders for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
Do you support or oppose President Obama unilaterally exchanging five hardened Taliban commanders from Guantanamo for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl?

Legislative Update:
Late last year, the House and Senate passed a budget that would set the overall spending limits for the coming fiscal year. Now, it is appropriation season, where the details are added to the budget, and twelve appropriation bills specify exactly how that budget amount will be allocated.
Last month, the House passed three of these appropriation bills, including Military Construction/Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Commerce, Justice, and Science. This is the earliest start that Congress has made on this process since 1974. Regrettably,
the Senate has yet to even begin the appropriation process by considering a single appropriations bill.
This week, the House is scheduled to consider the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture appropriations bills, furthering our intention to individually consider and vote on all twelve appropriation bills in the coming weeks. I am hopeful that Congress will return to Regular Order so we can practice diligent and transparent oversight of taxpayer dollars, properly fund our priorities and cut waste.
