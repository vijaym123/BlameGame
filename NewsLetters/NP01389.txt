Dear
Friend,
With the 2015
Congressional Art Competition coming to a close, I would like to invite
you to see the great artwork high school students from around the 11th
Congressional District have submitted.
This year, we're giving you the chance to vote for
your favorite piece by participating in the "Everybody's a Critic"
Facebook contest. You can find pictures of the competition entries on my
Facebook page and choose your favorite by "liking" that piece. The
winner will receive a special crowd favorite award at our
reception.
Click
here
to visit my Facebook page and
cast your vote.
The artwork will be on display at the Naper
Settlement Pre-Emption House, 523 S. Webster Street in Naperville, from
April 25th through May 2nd. We will also be hosting our closing
reception and announcing the winners of the competition on Saturday, May 2nd
at 10:00 a.m.
Consider forwarding this email or tell your friends and family to

Remember, I am here to work for you. If you
have any questions, or concerns please feel free to

Facebook

Sincerely,
Bill Foster
Member of
