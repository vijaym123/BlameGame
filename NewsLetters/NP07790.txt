Discussing the Latest Government Agency 'Hard Drive Crash' on Fox
News
First it was Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
official Lois Lerner's emails that went missing due to a mysterious
"hard drive crash." Then Congress was informed that the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) also lost emails relevant to an ongoing
investigation. This week, it came to light that an employee of the Federal
Election Commission (FEC), who was a former colleague of Lois Lerner's and
was under investigation also experienced a convenient "hard drive
crash." April Sands was an attorney for the FEC who admitted to violating
the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in political
activity using government resources. Sands posted on social media
calling Republicans the "enemy" and soliciting support for President
Obama's reelection. This lawlessness and corruption needs to stop. I'll
continue to investigate this cover up and help provide answers to the
American people.

Introducing a Bill to Combat Human
Trafficking
On Tuesday evening, I introduced the bipartisan Human Trafficking
Detection Act aimed at combating human trafficking. Did you know that
17,500 people are trafficked through the United States each yearhalf
of which are children? Human trafficking is truly the great tragedy
of our time. This bill would equip officials who directly interface
with potential traffickers and victims at our nation's borders and in
airports with important detection training. The bill will also
require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to annually report to
Congress the number of potential human trafficking cases reported by its
federal agents. We must do all that we can to end modern day
slavery.

Standing with Israel
As the conflict between
Israelis and Hamas terrorists continues to escalate, my prayers are
with the families of innocent victims on both sides. I continue to pray
for peace. I hope we all do. But until that peace comes, I will
continue to remain unwavering in my support of Israel's right to defend
itself. Hamas has used innocent civilians as human shields, while Israel
has gone to great lengths to warn civilians before attacks to try to
avoid casualties. Israel agreed to an Egypt-brokered agreement to halt
the conflict, but Hamas declined and continued to shower Israel with
rocket attacks. On Wednesday evening, Israel and Hamas agreed to a
ceasefire, only for Hamas to break it after just two hours. We must continue
to pray for peace but in the meantime stand with our ally Israel. You
can read an op-ed I wrote in the Jerusalem Post on the need to stand
shoulder to shoulder with Israel

Working with North Carolina Farmers
It was a pleasure
to meet with Kaleb Rathbone of the Carolina Farm Credit. Many
farms in Western North Carolina rely on their financial assistance and
helpful services.
