Reforming the Endangered Species Act
Last week, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) listed the Lesser
Prairie Chicken as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
I'm frustrated and disappointed by this listing, which will have
far-reaching consequences in West Texas.
The timing of this decision
is being driven by activist lawsuits, instead of what's best for the
species and the communities near its habitat.
What's worse is that
this listing is unnecessary.
The Western Association of Fish and
Wildlife Agencies' Range-Wide Conservation Plan-an unprecedented
collaboration between farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and
governments across five states-would have successfully conserved
habitat and fully recovered the species.
But instead of cooperative
conservation, we're getting more Washington-Knows-Best regulations.
Decisions like this will discourage innovative conservation efforts in
the private sector, and ultimately do more harm than good.
The decision to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken was caused, in part, by
problems with the Endangered Species Act itself.
It's costly and
bureaucratic, and only about 2% of species listed under the Act have
ever recovered enough to be delisted.
It's time for reform.
That's why I introduced two bills last week which would improve the ESA
to make it more effective and prevent unnecessary listings like this in
the future. H.R. 4284, the ESA Improvement Act
, empowers states to protect and
restore species and prevent listings by requiring FWS to involve them
in the process before a listing is proposed. H.R. 4317, the State,
Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and Recovery Act
, requires FWS to provide
states with the data they are using to justify their listing decisions.
Additionally, it requires FWS to consider scientific data submitted by
state and local governments before making a determination. I wrote a
column for the Lubbock Avalanche Journal
this week that explains why
these reforms are needed.
I'll keep you posted on the status of these
reforms as they move through the legislative process.
Keep Posted on the IRS Investigation
When it came to light that the IRS was targeting groups
based on their political affiliations, a lot of
you wrote to me about your concerns that this was limiting free speech.
Non-profit civic service organizations frequently conduct
get-out-the-vote drives and host candidate debates as part of their
mission to increase civic engagement.
In 2012, the IRS attempted to
identify civic service groups with conservative leanings and subject
their applications for tax-exempt status to extra scrutiny.
Targeted
groups were asked to give the government information about their
donors, their individual members' political activities, and even their
members' posts on social media.
This is a blatant violation of our rights.
That's why last month I
voted to pass H.R. 3685
, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by
the IRS Act.
The bill prevents the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from
redefining public service activities by non-profit social welfare
organizations as political campaign intervention.
It's also critical
that we get to the bottom of this scandal so we can be sure it doesn't
ever happen again.
House Republicans have also been conducting a
detailed investigation of these IRS activities through research,
reporting, and oversight hearings. To help you stay up-to-date on this
investigation, we've gathered all the information on IRS targeting
online at www.gop.gov/IRS

Action Item: Protecting Hourly Workers from Obamacare
This week, the House will vote on the Save American Workers Act
, which helps protect hourly employees
from a harmful side-effect of Obamacare.
I co-sponsored this
legislation to stop workers from having their hours cut to comply with
the President's health care bill.
The Affordable Care Act-or,
Obamacare-defined full-time employment as a 30-hour work week.
That
contradicts the standard legal definition of a 40-hour week.
The
Obamacare mandate requires employers to provide health care coverage to
full-time employees, which is causing companies who are being hit hard
by costs to cut back workers' hours. So businesses can't afford to pay
part-time, hourly workers to work more than 29 hours a week-otherwise
they'll be counted as full-time employees.
What does that mean? Hourly
employees who used to work 30 hours or more are seeing their hours cut
and their paychecks decrease.
The Save American Workers Act redefines
a full-time employee under Obamacare as someone who works 40 hours per
week.
That allows businesses and employees to decide their hours based
on what is best for them-not on an arbitrary Obamacare definition.

Reforming
the
Endangered

Last

the
Fish

Wildlife

(FWS)
listed
the
Lesser

as
threatened
under
the
Endangered

Act
(ESA).
I&#8217;m
frustrated
and
disappointed
by
this

which
will
have
far-reaching

in
West
Texas.
The
timing
of
this

is
being
driven
by
activist
lawsuits,
instead

what&#8217;s
best
for
the

and

What&#8217;s

is
that
this

unnecessary.

we&#8217;re

and
ultimately

The

which
would
improve
the

H.R.

and

requiring
FWS

H.R.

requires
FWS
to
provide

it
requires

it
came

a

Targeted
groups
were
asked
to

about
their

their
individual
members&#8217;
political
activities,
and
even
their
members&#8217;

This
is
a
blatant

Action
Item:
Protecting
Hourly
Workers
from
Obamacare
This
week,
the
House
will
vote
on
the
Save
American
Workers
Act ,
which
helps
protect
hourly
employees
from
a
harmful
side-effect
of
Obamacare.
I
co-sponsored
this
legislation
to
stop
workers
from
having
their
hours
cut
to
comply
with
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
bill.
The
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;or,
Obamacare&#8212;defined
full-time
employment
as
a
30-hour
work
week.
That
contradicts
the
standard
legal
definition
of
a
40-hour
week.
The
Obamacare
mandate
requires
employers
to
provide
health
care
coverage
to
full-time
employees,
which
is
causing
companies
who
are
being
hit
hard
by
costs
to
cut
back
workers&#8217;
hours.
So
businesses
can&#8217;t
afford
to
pay
part-time,
hourly
workers
to
work
more
than
29
hours
a
week&#8212;otherwise
they&#8217;ll
be
counted
as
full-time
employees.
What
does
that
mean?
Hourly
employees
who
used
to
work
30
hours
or
more
are
seeing
their
hours
cut
and
their
paychecks
decrease.
The
Save
American
Workers
Act
redefines
a
full-time
employee
under
Obamacare
as
someone
who
works
40
hours
per
week.
That
allows
businesses
and
employees
to
decide
their
hours
based
on
what
is
best
for
them&#8212;not
on
an
arbitrary
Obamacare
definition.
