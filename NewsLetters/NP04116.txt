The team from Operation Homefront Support, a group of business and
civic volunteers, is gearing up for their annual care package drive for members of our Armed Services.
Thank you to Geri and Nola and the whole Operation Homefront Support Team for all you do to make being away from home just a bit easier for our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, serving our country.

Thank you for your hospitality. I wish you all a blessed Thanksgiving.

Apply now for the U.S. service academies
Young men and women from the Northern Marianas, interested in a college education and committed to serving our country, may apply now for a congressional nomination to one of the U.S. Service Academies. As a result of the provision I added to U.S. Public Law 111-84 , there are four openings available this year: two at the Naval Academy, and two at the Air Force Academy. One slot is open, too, at the Merchant Marine Academy. Attending any of the academies is a unique opportunity to obtain a topnotch education and an officers commission in return for five years of service. As your Congressman, I make nominations, but the final selection among nominees is made by academy admission officials. They look for strong grades, high SAT or ACT scores, physical ability, and leadership potential. More information and an application form are available at http://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/academy-nominations, or you may also go to your local congressional office. Applications are due by December 12, 2014.

She was called to serve, and she answered. Mayor Marian Tudela was sworn in on June 8, 2014, as the first female Mayor of Saipan, assuming the post after the untimely death of +Mayor Donald Glenn Flores. Mayor Tudelas willingness to step forward and serve her community is an inspiration to us all. I recognized her accomplishments and service in a statement in the Congressional Record
this month and presented a framed copy to the Mayor this week. Thank you, Mayor Marian Tudela.

The students in the
Linala
Malawasch Academy of Hopwood Junior High School are always an inspiration. LMA instructors, Mr. Guerrero and Ms. Tudela, invited me to visit the Academy this week, as I do periodically. Thank you, instructors, for keeping the fire of education burning among your students. And thank you, students, for your hospitality. Remember: keep your heads held high, keep pushing for who you want to be, and keep striving for more!
