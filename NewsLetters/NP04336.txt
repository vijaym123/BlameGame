FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Rigell Elected to Powerful
Appropriations Committee for 114th Congress
Position will further help Rigell advocate for districts key interests;
First VA-02 Representative to serve on Appropriations in more than 100 years
Washington, DC - Today Congressman Scott Rigell (VA-02) was elected to the House Committee on Appropriations for the 114th Congress which convenes in January.
The Appropriations Committee is widely known as one of the most powerful committees in Congress.
The assignment will allow Rigell, who is known as a fiscal hawk and champion of the military community, to advocate for sound fiscal policy and continued funding for key defense, maritime, trade, and other interests vital to Hampton Roads.
I am deeply honored to serve on this important committee, and it is humbling to be selected to join such an influential group at a critical time in our nations journey, said Rigell, who represents more men and women in uniform than any other Member of the House of Representatives.
In these challenging times, every taxpayer dollar must be wisely spent.
Our region plays a crucial role in our national defense and Virginia will be represented at the Appropriations table.
The Appropriations Committee, chaired by longtime legislator Hal Rogers of Kentucky, holds the power of the purse and sets specific expenditures for the United States Government. The committee is broken up into twelve subcommittees that cover all funding categories for the federal government. Rigells subcommittee appointments will be announced in January, and as a member of the full committee, Rigell will play a role in all appropriations decisions.
Chairman Rogers said: Its my pleasure to welcome Scott to the Appropriations Committee. He joins the Committee at a critical time
we face some big challenges, and a long to-do list ahead of us as we continue to fight for stability, continuity, and responsibility in the federal budgeting process.
With his focus on national security, economic improvement, and shrewd budgeting, I know Scott will help contribute to the continued success of the Committee.
Virginia receives more defense dollars than any other state in the nation, and a full 10% of the Pentagons budget flows to the Commonwealth.
Rigells appointment ensures that a Virginia Republican remains on the Committee. Virginia Representative Frank Wolf, a longtime member of the Appropriations committee, retires from Congress this year.
Rigell is the first Representative from VA-02 to sit on the Appropriations Committee since Representative Edward Everett Holland held a spot in 1911.
Virginia's Second Congressional District includes Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval station in the world, Naval Air Station Oceana, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, and Joint Base Langley-Eustis.
Rigells position will complement the Hampton Roads congressional delegations service on the House Armed Services Committee, further strengthening Hampton Roads as one of the strongest defense hubs in the country.
Rigell had previously served on the House Budget Committee and the House Armed Services Committee.
I am eager to work with Chairman Rogers in his bold effort to restore regular order and put the nation on a better fiscal path, said Rigell.
