Gwinnett County Serves Our Seniors
Last week I had the privilege of attending the grand opening of the new
commercial kitchen at the Gwinnett Senior Services Center
. The kitchen
will help our community prepare meals for four senior centers and for
the Meals on Wheels program.

Major Robotic Surgery Training Center Located in the Seventh District
The 7th District is home to many local businesses that are on the
cutting-edge of innovation in their industry. One such business is
Intuitive Surgical
in Norcross. This facility
trains surgeons to use state-of-the-art robotic surgery instruments so
that surgery is less invasive and patients have shorter recovery times
and less threat of infection. While the company is based in California,
its Norcross facility is the hub for training surgeons up and down the
East Coast.

When I worry about a one-size-fits-all health care delivery system run
out of Washington, D.C., I'm not worried solely about the immediate
poor outcomes for patients; I'm worried about losing the incentives for
brilliant minds like those behind daVinci to keep innovating and
improving health care delivery to enhance outcomes and lower costs
long-term.
New taxes in the Obamacare law fall solely on medical
device manufacturers, and these new taxes will unquestionably cost
America jobs.
Of all the things we can do to protect and to build jobs
in this country, ending the punitive taxes on innovators would be an
easy and powerful first step.
Ideas from America's Next Generation of Leaders
I make it a priority to spend time with the young people in the Seventh
District, and one such meeting that stood out this week was a visit to
my district office from a group of Gwinnett County high school students
who are working hard to establish an American Diplomatic Youth Council.
The State Department already has such a program through our embassies
abroad to facilitate cooperation between the local embassy and the
local youth.
The goal of our local young people is to incorporate
American youth into this program to further build bonds of cooperation
and understanding.
Their well-researched and thoughtful proposal
prompted a number of questions that I will now address with the State
Department.
One voice really can make a difference, and in this case,
three young voices are making a difference.
I'm extremely proud of
their leadership and continue to be encouraged by their passion.
Supporting Our Veterans
You might remember earlier this year that my office hosted a Veterans
Assistance Open House
. There are many issues that
divide us, but thankfully supporting our nation's military veterans is
one that brings us all together. First Lady Michelle Obama and Mrs.
Jill Biden are working together with the Department of Defense and the
Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a new Veterans Employment
Center
website that
will be a one-stop-shop for service members to find jobs once they are
discharged from our Armed Forces.

Our community's local efforts to support veteran's continues to grow.
This week I met with a local outreach group called "Team River Runner"
about the work they are doing to serve veterans. Team River Runner is a
national program with a local chapter whose focus is to provide
disabled veterans an opportunity to experience kayaking as an
additional means of therapy, both physical and mental. These volunteers
are just another example of individuals serving their community.

The Week Ahead
This week I'm back in Washington where the House is beginning
consideration of bills to appropriate funds for FY2015. The two bills
this week are the "FY15 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act
" and the "FY15 Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act
."
The Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which I'm a member,
is examining the effects of natural gas exports on U.S. foreign policy.
This has been a major issue recently as the U.S. considers how
increasing natural gas exports might help our allies in Eastern Europe
wean themselves off of Russian gas imports.
The Budget Committee, of which I am also a member, is continuing to
investigate the successes and failures of America's multi-trillion war
on poverty.
We'll be talking to experts from the frontlines about what
efforts are helping and what efforts may be making a bad situation even
worse.
