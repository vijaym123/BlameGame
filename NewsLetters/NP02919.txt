Attaining a New
Leadership Role in the House Armed Services
Committee
2/4/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn has been named the Vice Chairman of the
Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services
Committee. The Strategic Forces Subcommittee oversees our nations strategic
weapons, ballistic missile defense, space programs, and Department of
Energy national security programs (excluding nonproliferation
programs). It makes sure our nation is properly prepared for any missile or
nuclear attacks.
Our country
has never faced a strategic environment as complex and multi-faceted
as we face today. Shaping a military that is equipped to face this
environment will require a diligent effort from Congress. With all these
threats, Doug will play a key role in our expanded HASC leadership
team, working to support our troops and shape our strategy. He brings
impressive talent and experience to the mission."
- House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Mac Thornberry (TX-13)
"I
am humbled and honored to be named the Vice Chairman of the extremely
important Strategic Forces Subcommittee. This appointment will allow
be to serve in a critical leadership role operating at the cutting
edge of our missile defense, military space, and energy related
national security programs. I will work hard to protect our nation, ensure
that our region continues to be an essential asset to our national
security, and will expand the influence of Colorado's civilian and
military defense industries."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
