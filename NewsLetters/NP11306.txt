Dear Friends,
On Thursday I chaired a field hearing of the Homeland Security
Committee at Texas Southern University in Houston that focused on
combating human trafficking.
It was one of the most powerful and
moving hearings I have had the privilege to be a part of.
Human trafficking results in countless individuals, mostly women and
children, being sold or held captive and forced to work as prostitutes
or slave labor.
We had two panels of witnesses, one focusing on the
law enforcement efforts needed to combat trafficking and one that
included brave and powerful testimony from survivors of trafficking
that are now leading the charge to save and rehabilitate current
victims.
You can watch my questioning of the two panels below.

This ongoing epidemic must be addressed and we must do more in order to
find, stop, and bring to justice those who operate human trafficking
rings and those who exploit these victims.
I have cosponsored two
pieces of legislation authored by Congressman Ted Poe designed to
combat human trafficking.
H.R. 2805, the End Sex Trafficking Act
would expand the
federal criminal code to further prohibitions against patronizing or
soliciting commercial sex acts with a victim of human trafficking.
This bill would also expand the definition of sex trafficking to
include patronizing or soliciting any person for the purpose of a sex
act. H.R. 3530, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
would create grants
for state and local governments to develop support programs for
victims.
This bill would also put a new focus on penalizing those who
pay for sex acts. You can watch my closing statement from yesterday's
hearing on the need for Congress to work together below.

The hearing came on the heels of the discovery of a human smuggling
stash house just this week in Houston.
Over 100 men, women, and
children were found being held captive in squalid conditions in a tiny,
rundown house.
The discovery of this smuggling stash house highlights
both the pressing need to secure our borders and the dangers of human
smuggling.
If not for this discovery it is possible that those being
held, especially the women and children, could have been sold into sex
trafficking and the leaders of this smuggling ring could have continued
to subvert our borders and laws without consequences.
I spoke on the
need to prevent human smuggling tragedies and secure our border after
the hearing, you can watch the video below.

The
hearing
came
on
the
heels
of
the
discovery
of
a
human
smuggling
stash
house
just
this
week
in
Houston.
Over
100
men,
women,
and
children
were
found
being
held
captive
in
squalid
conditions
in
a
tiny,
rundown
house.
The

of
this

house
highlights
both
the

dangers
of
human

If
not
for
this
discovery
it
is
possible
that
those
being
held,
especially
the
women
and
children,
could
have
been
sold
into
sex
trafficking
and
the
leaders
of

ring
could
have
continued
to
subvert
