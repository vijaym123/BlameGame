Scott, Forbes, Wittman &amp; Rigell Commend Navy Decision to Consolidate Military Sealift Command at Norfolk
Washington, D.C.
- Representatives Robert C. Bobby Scott (VA-03), Randy Forbes (VA-04), Rob Wittman (VA-01) and Scott Rigell (VA-02) issued the following joint statement on the announcement by the United States Navy that it intends to consolidate the headquarters of its Military Sealift Command from the Washington Navy Yard to Naval Station Norfolk by the end of Fiscal Year 2019:
This announcement from the Navy is welcome news for Hampton Roads.
It is estimated that more than 400 civilian personnel and 52 active duty personnel will relocate to our region.
This action is also an important strategic decision by the Navy.
For the last several years, the headquarters for the Military Sealift Command has been split between Washington, D.C. and Naval Station Norfolk.
This consolidation will help our Navy streamline its processes while also saving taxpayers money from the reduced costs of operating a single headquarters location. We look forward to welcoming the men and women attached to this important command to Hampton Roads.
