Wicker Points to Bipartisan
Accomplishments in Lead-Up to New Congress
As Republicans Prepare
to Take Control, a Lesson in What Worked in
2014
The 113 th
Congress ended the year and its term with a couple of
important victories, many of which were long overdue.
The "National
Defense Authorization Act" (NDAA), for example, provides an outline
of America's military priorities and national security interests.
Its recent passage marked 53 consecutive years of bipartisan
cooperation on America's major defense policy.
Like many of my colleagues, I am hopeful that the new
Congress will find ways to work across party lines in pursuit of more
legislative achievements like NDAA.
This term often fell short of that
goal, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) used procedural
tactics to prevent regular order and debate.
There were, however,
exceptions to the frequent gridlock, and these accomplishments serve
as an appropriate starting point for moving
forward.
Legislative highlights of 2014
include:
A long-awaited upgrade for America's
ports and waterways.
In May, Congress passed the final
version of the "Water Resources Development Act," a comprehensive bill to
ensure navigable waterways and modernized ports.
The
legislation, which had not been reauthorized in seven years, is a big win for
Mississippi, supporting improvements to our state's water infrastructure
as well as restoration projects along the Gulf Coast.
It also
increases the funding available for maintenance dredging, which is
urgently needed at ports across the
country.
Important reforms to veteran
care.
Following reports of widespread misconduct at VA
hospitals across the country, Congress passed legislation to improve
veterans' quality of care and restore accountability.
The new law allows
veterans to seek medical care outside the VA system if they cannot
get an appointment within 30 days or if they live more than 40 miles
from a VA facility.
It also empowers the VA Secretary to demote or
fire employees for wrongdoing or poor
performance.
Support for a highly skilled and competitive U.S. workforce.
With 9 million Americans unemployed, job training and education
programs are critical to matching employers' needs with skilled
workers.
Congress enacted the "Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act"
with this in mind, reauthorizing effective "one-stop" career
assistance centers across the nation.
The legislation also eliminates
ineffective or duplicative federal job training programs, streamlining
the system and reducing government
waste.
A stronger fight against muscular
dystrophy.
As the author of the original "MD CARE Act" in 2001, I was
thrilled when the "MD CARE Act Amendments of 2014" became law in
September.
The legislation, which I introduced with Sen. Amy
Klobuchar (D-Minn.), builds on the progress we have made by allowing
researchers to focus on multiple forms of muscular dystrophy.
It also
removes restrictions on pediatric research, enabling medical
professionals to address the needs and challenges of older
patients.
More stability for
America's farmers.
Mississippi is home to more than 42,000 farms,
supporting an industry that remains the state's largest job creator
and a massive part of our local economy.
The new "Farm Bill,"
officially titled the "Agricultural Act of 2014," will help our farmers
and ranchers stay competitive by providing certainty about the nation's
agriculture policy over the next five years.
It also makes
sensible reforms to the food stamp program, cutting government spending by
billions of dollars.
The 114 th
Congress has an opportunity to build on these
successes and learn from past mistakes.
After years of political
brinkmanship, Americans expect responsible governing from their
elected officials.
With the economy still weak and national priorities
in need of constructive solutions, the coming year needs to be one of
action.
