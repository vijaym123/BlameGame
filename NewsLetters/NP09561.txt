15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
I spent this past district work week meeting with constituents, touring a local university, participating in a research roundtable at Moffitt Cancer Center, hosting an employee town hall meeting, and welcoming 30 new citizens to the United States at their naturalization ceremony. I included a few pictures below.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross

Congratulations to those who persevered through a lengthy process and have officially become citizens of the United States. I encourage them to share their ideas, get involved in their communities and exercise their great rights and freedoms for which so many have fought and died. I am honored and thankful to say that this is our country, and Im glad to have them as my neighbors and friends.
