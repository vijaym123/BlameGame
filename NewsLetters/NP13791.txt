Dear Friend,
This
week, along with my colleague Congressman Jim
Bridenstine
of Oklahoma, I introduced
the Provide for the Common Defense Act. This bill would eliminate
devastating national security budget cuts levied by sequestration for two
years in exchange for common sense mandatory spending and entitlement
reforms endorsed by President Obama. Following the unwinding of the
defense sequester cuts, the bill allocates approximately $200 billion
in savings toward deficit
reduction.
Washington has a spending problem, but
incessantly and mindlessly cutting national security will not get us out of our
fiscal mess. Completely eliminating the Department of Defense (DOD)
would not even pay off this years deficit
let alone seriously reduce
our $17 trillion national debt. Congress needs to give our military
relief rather than use it as a punching bag. Even President Obama must
realize that out-of-control entitlement spending is drowning our
country in debt. Our bill cancels national security sequestration for two
years by enacting a few Obama-endorsed reforms that will actually
produce approximately $200 billion in savings over ten years. Two-thirds of
the savings will go toward debt
reduction.

Events
Recently, I had the privilege and honor of meeting Army Captain
William Swenson. Captain Swenson is a Medal of Honor recipient and the first
living Army officer recipient since the Vietnam War. Captain Swenson
earned the Medal of Honor by risking his life, uncovered, to render
medical aid to a fellow wounded soldier, and rescue others and recover
fallen comrades, during the Battle of
Ganjgal
in Afghanistan. Please join me in
congratulating and thanking this American hero!
Additionally, I ask that over
the weekend you take a few moments to puase and reflect on the 72nd
anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Many veterans in the Fifth
Congressional District fought to win the Second World War and preserve
our freedoms to this day. We honor them always and thank them for
their monumental service to this nation.
On Wednesday,
December
4th , I was
honored to take part in the Armed Forces Network's video message wishing
our service men and women a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. I
will make sure to share the finished video with you in a future
newsletter.
On Thursday,
December
5th , it was
truly incredible to meet one of my heroes, former President of Poland
Lech
Walesa.
President Walesa has been a fierce protector
of freedom for the people of Poland for decades. He was instrumental
in the fall of the Soviet Union and is one of this generation's
greatest moral leaders.
