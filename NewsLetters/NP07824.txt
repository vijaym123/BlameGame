Supporting Life-Saving Medical Research
I
enjoyed meeting with several members of
The Science Coalition
last week to
discuss the great importance of continuing to invest in scientific and
medical research. The Science Coalition is a nonprofit, nonpartisan
organization of more than 50 of the nations leading public and private
research universities, including
the University of Kansas Medical Center . The coalition's
goal is to maintain the federal governments investment in scientific
research as a means to stimulate the economy, encourage innovation and
increase Americas global
competitiveness.
We discussed how cancer and other diseases touch every
American in some way, and how we must continue supporting efforts to find
life-saving cures and remedies. This has always been one of my top
priorities in Congress.
Rep. Yoder speaks to several members of The Science Coalition at a
morning meeting in Washington, DC.
Thank you to
University of
Kansas Medical Center Executive Vice Chancellor Dr. Doug Girod
for the introduction, and to The Science Coalition for the invitation to
speak.
Workforce Training for a 21st Century
American Economy
Last week, the House passed the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
-
H.R.
803
- with overwhelming support from both Republicans and
Democrats, sending the legislation, which had already passed the Senate, to
the President's desk. This much-needed legislation updates, improves
and reauthorizes decades-old workforce development and training
programs.
WIOA
improves federal workforce development programs, provides support to people
with disabilities to enter and remain competitive in job settings, and
supports the modern workforce our 21st century American economy relies
upon to compete globally. The bill also eliminates ineffective
programs. The bipartisan, bicameral agreement repeals 15 workforce
development programs, marking the first time in more than a decade Congress has
repealed ineffective programs. It also prevents the creation of new
programs and holds the line against demands for new federal
programs.
I spoke on the House floor before
we voted on the legislation in order to urge my colleagues to support
the bill.

Growing Immigration
Crisis on Southern Border
The immigration situation along
the U.S.-Mexican border has recently gained increased national
attention as thousands of unaccompanied children are crossing the border
into our southern border states. They are being held by officials in the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland
Security. The administration is now requesting
$3.7
billion
to increase the United States' ability to address the
surge of undocumented children crossing the
border.
I have great concerns about the president's request as
I believe he has not effectively enforced the laws already on our
books, has failed to outline an effective foreign policy for our borders,
and has not provided border agents the resources they need to
adequately monitor the very dangerous southern border. In addition, there
have been no clear plans discussed as to what will happen to these
thousands of children once they go through a court process that takes
years.
"Under current law, immigrant children from countries that don't
border the United States and who cross into this country by themselves
are turned over to HHS within 72 hours. From there, they often are
reunited with parents or placed with other relatives already living in the
country, while they wait for an immigration court to decide their
future. The court process can take years." -

Star.
As I've stated
before, I do not support amnesty and strongly believe we must address
the serious problems with our immigration system so that it rewards
those coming to America legally and through the proper
process.
Email
Privacy Act Continues Moving Forward
My
Email
Privacy Act
has now gained
227 bipartisan
cosponsors
and is still gaining more support each day. My Democrat colleague
Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colorado)
and I participated
in a discussion event on Thursday to highlight the momentum not only
our legislation is gaining, but the increased awareness and support the
American people have for the Email Privacy Act. The more Americans
hear that warrants are not required by federal agencies like the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the IRS to read their private emails,
the more they agree we need these important
reforms.
Congressman Yoder speaks about the Email
Privacy Act at an informational event attended by
supporters.
"Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), the other author of the Email Privacy Act,
said that their update to the arcane 1986 Electronic Communications
Privacy Act is really starting to take off. The Email Privacy Act
currently has 224 co-sponsors in the House, well over half the chamber."

Each day more of our colleagues join in supporting this common
sense effort and I'm confident we will get our bill passed by the
House before the August District Work Period.
Increasing Veterans Suicide Prevention Efforts
Last week, the
House Veterans' Affairs Committee held an extremely important hearing,
focused on the ongoing tragedy of veterans suicide. It is completely
heartbreaking that nearly
twenty-two veterans take their own
lives each day
in our country. After courageously serving their
country, our veterans should receive the needed services and health
care they've earned, and it should not be so
difficult.
Click
here
to read more about last week's
House
Veterans' Affairs Committee
hearing.
I have asked to have my name added as a cosponsor to the
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for
American Veterans Act , which includes several provisions to
help increase the assistance and support we can offer our veterans;
including creating peer support and community outreach programs to help
service members better transition back to civilian life, creating
student loan repayment programs to recruit more psychiatrists to help
veterans, amending the discharge requirements for veterans with post
traumatic stress disorder, and
more.
This issue was recenty brought home to our community with the tragic
events surrounding the death of Kansas City native and Iraq veteran
Isaac Sims. The important issues of veteran mental health and care touch
each community across the country, and we owe it to our veterans to do
all we can to help them, to provide needed services for them and
their families, and to do prevent these tragic events from happening in
the future.

Kansas School
Superintendents Visit Washington
I had an informative meeting
with
Brenda Dietrich, Superintendent of Auburn Washburn USD
437 , and
Tom Trigg, Superintendent of Blue Valley USD
229 , last week in Washington. We visited first and foremost
about the importance of local control of public education and of
restoring decision-making to parents, teachers and communities. We talked
about their continued support of the
H.R. 5 - Student Success Act , legislation I voted
for, and that was passed by the House last year and was endorsed by
the School Superintendents
Association .
We also
discussed important Federal Communications Commission proposed changes to
E-Rate , which funds public schools and technology
development for students in public schools and libraries. I was proud to
join with the entire Kansas Congressional delegation in sending a
letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler last week urging the FCC to delay
their vote on the Chairman's misguided proposal to redistribute E-Rate
funds.

Thank you to Dr. Trigg and Dr. Dietrich for taking the time
to meet with me.
Kansas Speedway in
Washington for Congressional Motorsports Caucus
I enjoyed
meeting and visiting with
NASCAR President Mike Helton
and
Kansas Speedway President Patrick Warren
last
week at a meeting of the
Congressional Automotive Performance and Motorsports
Caucus . The Motorsports Caucus is a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol
Hill established to raise awareness of the economic impact and
importance to our Congressional districts of the automotive and
specialty-equipment industry.
We're
fortunate to have
Kansas Speedway
in KS-03. Thanks to Mike
and Patrick for their leadership in such an important (and fun)
industry.
Heart Disease and Stroke
Awareness
I appreciated the opportunity to meet with advocates from
the
American Heart Association
and
American
Stroke Association
early last week in Overland Park. We agree
that
National Institutes of Health (NIH)
funding is
critically important to the research efforts in our country. We must work
together to eliminate cardiovascular diseases and stroke, our
nations No. 1 and No. 4 causes of death. That's why I've voted to increase
NIH funding while aiming to make responsible spending reductions in
other areas.
Thank you to all
the staff and volunteers for your lifesaving work at the
AHA.
I also had the pleasure of meeting with
Dr. Sandra
Billinger , Ph.D., PT, and assistant professor in the Department of
Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science at the University of Kansas
Medical Center. She and her son Michael walked across the entire state
of Kansas last year in support of
National Stroke Awareness
Month.

Fact of the Week
Did you know that the federal
government paid out more than
$100 billion
in improper
payments to Americans last year
alone?
The improper payments came from fraud, clerical errors, insufficient
IRS enforcement and other additional
reasons.

Requesting Capitol Tours
Earlier last week, we
welcomed the
Venkat Family

They were visiting Washington, DC from their home in the 3rd District and
set up a Capitol tour through our
office.
If you are
traveling to Washington, DC and would like to set up a tour, you can
contact my office and my staff will help make the needed arrangements.

Joining
the Bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus
Dyslexia
is a neurological disorder that causes the brain to process and
interpret language differently. This language processing disorder hinders the
reading, writing, spelling and sometimes even speaking skills of tens
of thousands of Americans. Although numbers are hard to know for
sure, it's often estimated that
5-10 percent
of the
American population lives with
dyslexia.
Raising awareness of dyslexia and its effects is important to me
and that is why I have joined many of my colleagues from both sides of
the aisle in the
Bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia
Caucus .
The Bipartisan Congressional
Dyslexia Caucus was formed so that we can work across party lines to
educate members of the public about dyslexia, as well as to identify
policies that will support individuals as they overcome dyslexia and
pursue educational and career opportunities.
