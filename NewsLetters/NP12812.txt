Congressman Miller’s Response to the President’s State of the Union Address
This week, I had the honor of representing Inland Empire families on the House floor while our President presented the state of our great union. While I agree with the President’s intentions to expedite our economic recovery and restore the jobs lost during the recession, I cannot help but think of the work yet to be done to help the families in our district that have been unable to find steady employment or the economic recovery we have been promised over the past six years.
President Obama announced a year of action, and I welcome him to the fight. My primary focus remains on real solutions to create jobs, grow the local economy, and empower small business growth. Rather than waste our time on proposals that divide us, we need to focus on feasible, bipartisan solutions such as H.R. 3535, the Revitalize Our Cities Act, which I introduced along with Rep. Jerry McNerney. H.R. 3535 is a bipartisan bill crafted to provide job opportunities for hardworking Americans.
According to the most recent Census Bureau data, the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line went up by 6.7 million between 2008 and 2012. In our district, unemployment still hovers near 10 percent. This is unacceptable.
I remain committed to implementing tangible and timely solutions that will provide jobs for Inland Empire families and grow the middle class. My House colleagues and I have passed over three dozen pro-growth bills to improve American energy production to help address costs and create jobs, eliminate burdensome regulations on small businesses so they can hire more workers, and improve education and job training programs to give individuals the skills they need to provide for themselves and their families.
Additionally, I will continue to work to implement a patient-centered, affordable, and common-sense solution for our health care system. It is vital that families have access to health care coverage that will bring down costs, expand access, and protect our nation’s seniors without making it difficult for small businesses to succeed.
I will continue to collaborate with members from both sides of the aisle to represent the needs and concerns of my constituents, and fight to implement the solutions needed to create jobs, economic opportunities, and a sustainable health care system you all deserve.
