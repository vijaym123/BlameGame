Friends,
I wanted to send you another quick update on how things are going.
This election is not over yet. Ballots are still being processed, and we have a team in place that is helping to ensure that every legal ballot is counted.
We have full faith in the registrar&#39;s office and commend their professionalism throughout this process.
Our opponent, however, has a team challenging the validity of thousands of votes -- which both slows this process and potentially impacts the outcome of the election.
For this reason, we must continue to raise funds in order to support our top-notch legal team on the ground monitoring this process. Given how this has unfolded so far, we are also preparing for the possibility of a recount. Please click below and give what you can right now.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
We expect to have another update this evening, so we&#39;ll be back in touch. Thanks for hanging in there with me through this process.
Be well,
Ami
