MIDNIGHT DEADLINE
ONLY 42 GIFTS NEEDED TO UNLOCK THE MATCH
David -- don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity.
Chip in right now &gt;&gt; ------------
Here&rsquo;s the bad (okay, AWFUL) news:
With a brand new poll showing Cheri in SINGLE-DIGITS with her Tea Party opponent, Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC just booked a $1,OOO,OOO ad blitz on Illinois T.V. Here&rsquo;s the good (okay, AMAZING) news: A group of Cheri&rsquo;s supporters have agreed to MATCH ALL GIFTS if we can reach 2OO donations by midnight.
David, we can&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about making your first online donation for Cheri, there&rsquo;s NEVER been a better time.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
