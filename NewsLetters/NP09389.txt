Dear
Friends,
During this Memorial Day, we come together as a community, united in
reverence for the men and women who lost their lives in the line of
duty.
I am grateful for the opportunity to express my gratitude
for their sacrifice; without it, I could not enjoy the freedom that
makes the United States so special.
With these heroes in
mind, I want to honor Lt. Col. Mercedes O. Cubria, a Cuban-American who
served in the U.S. Army.
Lt. Col. Mercedes O. Cubria was the
first Cuban born woman to serve in the U.S. Army and was awarded the
Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star Medal for her valiant efforts in
World War II.
Monday is set aside as a special day to reflect on
heroes
like Lt. Col. Cubria
lost in past conflicts and on the
sacrifices they endured for the good of the nation.
I thank the
veterans who have given the ultimate sacrifice and the military
families who have endured great pain in the name of country and
honor.
As the proud wife of a Vietnam veteran and step-mother to
Marine aviators, I fully comprehend the sacrifices of the military
calling: sacrifices made not only by thousands of American soldiers, but
also by their families that live in uncertainty back home, always fearful
for the wellbeing of their loved ones.
As we come together to
enjoy the freedom that the men and women in our military fought for so
valiantly, let us keep them in our thoughts and
prayers.
Let us never forget the service that American soldiers have
made in the past, are making as you read this today, and will continue
to make for years to come.
Sincerely,
Ileana
