&ldquo;In pretty much every election we&rsquo;ve covered, the polls have more clearly broken toward one or another party by this point.&rdquo; --

Dear Friend,
If the pollsters and the pundits are to be believed, we need to win just about every close race on Tuesday. Right now, Democrats are running short -- on time and room for error.
And if we come up short on our $16O,OOO goal for October, we could be in trouble. If we miss our fundraising goals, we can&rsquo;t run the kind of GOTV operations that will lead us to victory. Help us keep our organizers in the field and getting out the vote -- chip in $5 before midnight.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
Polling guru Nate Silver says that this year&rsquo;s elections aren&rsquo;t like 2012 or 2010. The Republicans have an advantage, but as Silver puts it, &ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t been able to put Democrats away.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re still in this.
Democrats can win this year, but only if we make the most of every remaining moment of this campaign. Please contribute $5, $10, or more toward our $16O,OOO goal -- we only have 15 hours left.
Thank you.
