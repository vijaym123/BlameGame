OpEd: Congress Should Protect Patent System, Not Weaken It

At the recent Northern Kentucky Regional First LEGO League Robotics tournament, I marveled at the imagination and creativity displayed by so many young people. In these students, I see the spirit of ingenuity and a culture of invention that have been critical to our nations economic success for over 2 centuries. I was reminded of the competitions I participated in as a young inventor, and of the American spirit of innovation that inspired me to obtain 29 patents.
I often think about these young inventors when we debate so-called patent reform in Congress. For example, about a year ago, the House of Representatives passed a bill called the Innovation Act. As a patent holder, I was deeply concerned about the consequences of this bill, which was rushed to the House floor without adequate debate. Fortunately, the bill did not pass the Senate.
In my opinion, the Innovation Act threatens American inventors, particularly individual inventors and those working at small businesses and startups. The bill attempts to fix a few isolated abuses of the patent system, but instead it sets forth a comprehensive overhaul of the existing legal framework that compromises the rights of all legitimate inventors.
Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the Innovation Act is the provision that makes it easier for corporations to keep shipping products even if a court finds reason to believe those products contain stolen inventions. When deciding whether to pay a fair license fee to the rightful inventors, or whether to steal a patented idea and risk a lawsuit, it is the threat of lost revenue that keeps the big companies honest.
In Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution, the Founding Fathers (some of whom were inventors themselves), gave Congress the authority to protect the discoveries of inventors. Inventors like myself rely on this protection as we create new products. Without the strong congressional protection mandated by our Constitution, inventors and the investors who back them will lose confidence that their work and ideas will be safeguarded. This loss of confidence will cause invention and investment to wither.
Our system of patent protection is what sets the United States apart from nations like China and India. In those countries, theft of intellectual property (IP) is rampant, statutory protections for IP are weak or non-existent, and courts are notoriously hostile to small inventors. If we water down our patent system and give up our competitive advantage, America will cease to be a global hub for innovation.
If Congress recklessly weakens our patent system by pushing through a bill similar to last years Innovation Act, inventors very livelihoods will be threatened. Inventors will stop inventing, and as the role models for young inventors quietly fade into history, fewer young students will pursue this rewarding career path. A decade from now, Congress will lament the lack of interest among our nations youth in subjects like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, arrogantly unaware that Congress itself destroyed it.
Thomas Massie is the Republican U.S. representative for Kentuckys 4th Congressional District.
Massies Patents
Thomas Massie graduated from MIT with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and a masters degree in mechanical engineering. According to his congressional office, Massie invented a technology that enabled people to interact with computers using their sense of touch, and leveraged that technology to found SensAble Technologies Inc., which created 70 jobs and obtained 29 patents. The haptic software and hardware he invented is used to design automobiles, jewelry, shoes, dental prosthetics, and even reconstructive implants for wounded soldiers.
