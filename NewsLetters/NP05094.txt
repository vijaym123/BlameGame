I hate to keep emailing you like this -- but we have nowhere else to turn.
We have campaigns out there working day-and-night to win their races. But they&rsquo;re getting hammered by all these Republican attack ads. They need our help.
And unless something changes in the next 12 hours, we will fail to help our friends when they needed us most.
So David, I'm pleading. We still need 4 donations from the 60659 zip code before tonight's ad buy deadline. Can you donate $5 right now? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy Pelosi
