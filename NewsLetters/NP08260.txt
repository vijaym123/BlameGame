David Johnson FIRST:
Paul Ryan came to
Chicago
to raise mega money for Bob Dold. THEN:
Dold went to
Washington
to mingle with Boehner, Ryan, and GOP mega-donors.
NOW:
Boehner&rsquo;s massive campaign arm launched an
$800,000
attack against Brad.
This is just the beginning.
We've got a plan to fight back -- and win -- but that means hitting our FEC fundraising goal. Are you in?
