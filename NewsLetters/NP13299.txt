Bipartisan Support for Mandatory Prison Sentencing Reform is
Growing
An alliance of tea party enthusiasts and liberal
leaders in Congress is pursuing major changes in the country's mandatory
sentencing laws.
I have been working with Senator Durbin to build
bipartisan support for reforming our country's mandatory sentencing
laws through a proposal we have introduced. Senators Paul, Leahy,
Cornyn, Portman, and Whitehouse have also introduced proposals to address
this problem.
Do you think Senator Reid should allow
more votes on smaller pieces of legislation like these proposals that
enjoy bipartisan support and that are passed through regular order
through the committee process, or do you think the country is better served
by Congress passing last-minute deals that are thousands of pages
long with very little time for public scrutiny?
