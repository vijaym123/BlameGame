Listening to you at
Home,
Working for you in
Washington
By:
Rep. Joe Barton
Our nation is at a cross
roads. The decisions made over the next few years will affect us for
generations. From the humanitarian crisis on the border and immigration
reform to ObamaCare
I want to know what you think should be done in
Washington.
You are my boss. You elected me to work for
you. I believe the best way to serve the people of the 6th District is
to talk to you directly. I want to let you know what is going on in the
Nations Capital, but most importantly I want to listen to your
concerns and answer your questions.
Over the next few weeks, I
will be holding a series of town hall meetings. The floor will be
yours. This is your meeting so you will guide the
conversation.
The times and locations are listed below. I hope you will be able
to attend. If you cant make it
you can always share your opinion by

I look
forward to meeting you!
