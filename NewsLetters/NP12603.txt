Currently, over half of the 50 states have adopted English as their official language. However, it has not been adopted as the official language of the United States as a whole.
Our nation is undeniably unique because of the diversity of its people.
At the same time, there are things that unify our country, like the American flag and our national anthem.
For years, there has been a debate as to whether or not English should also be one of the things that unites our nation, by requiring official functions of the United States to be conducted in English.
This includes all public documents, records, legislation and regulations, as well as hearings, official ceremonies, and public meetings. Official English legislation contains common-sense exceptions permitting the use of languages other than English for such things as public health and safety services, and judicial proceedings.
