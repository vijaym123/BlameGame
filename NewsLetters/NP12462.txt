Dear Friend,
This Spring Semester offers
lots of academic activities for students in this Congressional
district.
I hope you will help me spread the word about some new and some
returning competitions in which students of District 6 can
participate.
1st Annual
House STEM "App" Contest
High school students who live or
attend school within the Congressional District 6 boundaries are invited
to create and submit a software application ("app") for mobile, tablet,
or computer devices on a platform of their choice.
The apps will be judged by a panel of local
academic, software and technology professionals. The winning app from
each district will be featured on the U.S. House of Representatives
website and in the U.S. Capitol.
High school students aged 13 or older
are invited to
participate, either alone or as part of a team of up to four
members.
Students who are interested will need to register.
The
completed app design must be submitted by April 30,
2014.
For more information go to the
STEM App Challenge
page on my
website.
