The
Presidents Go It
Alone Approach Is An Affront to
Our Constitution
Dear Friend,
We face a crisis across our nation as
millions of illegal immigrants have
streamed into our country, overwhelming our
nations resources and often
endangering the lives those who make the
journey. The failure of this administration
and past administrations to secure our
border and fully enforce immigration law
undermines our sovereignty, public safety,
and the economic security of American
citizens.
On Thursday night, President Obama
addressed the nation and announced that he
will issue executive orders to effectively
grant legal status to nearly five million
illegal immigrants. I am very disappointed
by the Presidents decision to defy
the Constitution and American law by
issuing these executive orders, which will
only compound these serious problems we
already face by inviting more illegal
border crossings.
The House has passed legislation to help
address the root causes of this crisis -
our failure to secure the border and our
failure to adhere to the rule of law. Back
in August, we passed
critical
legislation
to stop the flow of illegal
border crossings by sending targeted
resources to bolster our border security
personnel, allowing border states to deploy
the National Guard, providing persons who
illegally entered the country a safe,
expeditious return to their home countries,
and implementing meaningful reforms that
will discourage, rather than encourage,
illegal immigration. These bills, like so
many others, are still awaiting
consideration in the Senate.
President Obama has acknowledged time
and time again that the Constitution limits
the authority of the executive branch to
act unilaterally to change the law, yet he
has decided to act contrary to his
constitutional powers and without the
consent of Congress to effectively grant
legal status to nearly five million illegal
immigrants. In fact, he has publicly stated
at least
22
times
that he does not have the ability
to act unilaterally or ignore immigration
law. Yet, on Thursday night, he told the
American people he will do exactly
that.
Once again, the President has chosen
political expediency over working together
with a new duly-elected House and Senate to
fix our broken immigration system. This is
not the way our government should work. In
the Constitution, our Founders established
a system of government with separate powers
and explicit checks and balances, and this
President must abide by the Constitution
and act within the bounds established in
it. I will continue to work with my
colleagues in Congress to stop this affront
to our Constitution, to strengthen the
security at our border, and to implement an
immigration policy that is rooted in the
rule of law.
