Say NO to Arctic Drilling
Last week, the Department of Interior cleared the way for the Shell Oil
Company to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean, laying the groundwork for
another potential environmental catastrophe. that monitor or clean up
toxins.
The Arctic Ocean is home to some of the world's most iconic wildlife
species but due to harsh conditions, the region lacks the
infrastructure to support adequately safe drilling or an effective
cleanup effort. Opening development on a new fossil fuel reservoir in
the Arctic not only puts the natural resources, ecosystems, and the
dependent communities at risk, it also worsens greenhouse gas emissions
and climate change. that monitor or clean up toxins.
On Friday, Jeff led a group of eighteen Senators in calling on the
Secretary of the Interior to prioritize our environment and climate, as
well as the safety and cultural practices of local communities, and
halt all offshore oil and gas drilling permits in the Arctic region.

Cleaning Up Our Rivers
Last Wednesday, Jeff led colleagues from the Oregon delegation to
introduce the Columbia River Basin Restoration Act. The Columbia has
become dangerously polluted with toxic chemicals, threatening fish and
human health and Oregon's commercial fishing and recreation industries.
The legislation would create a $50 million grant program for local
communities to engage in projects that monitor or clean up toxins.

Investing in Our Water Infrastructure
Much of Oregon's communities depend on Oregon's ports and water
infrastructure. But over the years, we've seen our investments in these
areas wither to the point where our ports and dams are on the verge of
collapse.
Last week, Jeff announced two major victories for two of Oregon's water
infrastructure mainstays: the Scoggins Dam and our small ports.
For decades, Washington County has been working hard to make
much-needed upgrades and repairs to the Scoggins Dam. These repairs are
critical pieces in the constant search for enough drinking,
environmental and irrigation water to meet the demands of a
fast-growing part of Oregon.
On the coast, ports are key economic engines, but without regular
dredging, many can become unsafe for commercial and recreational fleets
or even be shut down.
On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed an Energy and
Water bill that included two important provisions that Jeff pushed for
allocating resources for needed safety improvements and increased water
storage for the Scoggins Dam, and putting aside $50 million aside to
invest in our small, rural ports.

25 Town Halls
Yesterday, Jeff held his 25th Oregon town hall of the year in Gold
Beach. These town halls help answer questions and engage with voters on
how we can tackle the challenges facing Oregon and America. In each
town hall, Jeff has a chance to hear directly from Oregonians about the
issues they care about and that impact their local communities.
