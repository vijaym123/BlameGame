Recently, I cosponsored a bill ( H.R. 131 ) to address the interstate transportation of firearms or ammunition, and strengthen federal protections for law abiding Americans traveling with firearms. This bill has the NRAs endorsement, and would make it clear that, as long as they comply with the law, American citizens can legally transport firearms across state lines.
I will keep you posted on this bill's progress in the House.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. In case you missed it, I recently sent out a poll regarding legislation allowing concealed carry permit holders to legally bring their firearms into other states with similar laws.
90% of respondents
supported the legislation. You can take the poll
here , if you havent already.
