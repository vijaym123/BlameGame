Dear Friend,
Last week, I introduced the Protecting Children from Electronic
Cigarette Advertising Act to prohibit the advertising of e-cigarettes
to children. Having actively worked on smoking prevention and cessation
as a state legislator on the Public Health Committee and in my
childrens' classrooms, I am very concerned about the widespread
marketing of e-cigarettes to children to get them hooked early. Ads for
e-cigarettes that highlight flavors like bubblegum or gummy bears and
promote cartoon characters are shameless efforts to addict our kids.
Check out these side-by-side comparisons of the ads by e-cigarette
manufacturers today and those by the major cigarette manufacturers
before these practices were banned.
"Fruit flavors" 1959 vs. 2013
"Cartoon" 1987 vs. 2013
Despite serious health concerns, e-cigarettes are currently entirely
unregulated on the federal level. According to the Centers for Disease
Control, 1.8 million middle and high school students nationwide have
tried e-cigarettes, and over 75% of them have also smoked traditional
cigarettes. And these numbers are increasing dramatically. In a single
year, 2011 to 2012, the percentage of middle and high school students
using e-cigarettes more than doubled. We've made too much progress
reducing tobacco use by our children to roll back the clock.
"Design Your Own App" Competition Workshop for High School Students
This Saturday
Spread the word! I'm hosting a free workshop this Saturday at Naugatuck
Valley Community College in Waterbury where high school students can
learn how to code and program their own "app". I'm a cofounder of the
first annual Congressional STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Math) Competition
, a nationwide congressional
academic competition where high school students compete by programing
an app for mobile, tablet, or computer devices. Jobs in computer
programming and design are expected to grow by 50% in the next few
years, and our students need to be prepared.
WHAT: Computer coding workshop for high school students
Where: Technology Hall at Naugatuck Valley Community College, 750 Chase
Pkwy, Waterbury
When: Saturday, April 5, from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm
The Congressional STEM Competition is open to all high school students
who live in or are eligible to attend public schools located in the 5th
District. Students (individually or in teams of up to 4) enter the
competition by submitting a YouTube video explaining their app and what
they learned through the competition process by April 30, 2014. For
more information, visit my website

It's Time to End the Department of Defense's Contract with Russian Arms
Dealer
Since coming to Congress, I have voiced strong opposition to the
Department of Defense's decision to buy Mi-17 helicopters from
Rosoboronexport, a Russian arms company, instead of an American
manufacturer. Russia is the main arms supplier fueling violence in
Syria, and now, in light of Russia's blatant violation of their
international obligations and Ukraine's sovereignty, the least we
should do is cancel any remaining contracts. I have sent letters to the
Department of Defense to end this contract to make it clear to
President Putin that his actions in Ukraine are unacceptable. It's time
to put our money where our mouth is and stop sending American taxpayers'
dollars to Russian arms suppliers. This is about our national security
and supporting jobs in manufacturing right here in Connecticut and
across the country.

from you.

Last
