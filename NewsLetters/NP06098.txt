CALLING ALL
INTERNS!
I am currently
seeking highly motivated college students to serve as interns in my district
offices in Rogers, Fort Smith, and Harrison.
A congressional internship is a rewarding
experience, and district office interns will work closely with my staff
and constituents while learning the inner workings of the United
States Congress and about issues affecting Arkansans. I encourage those
interested in political science, government, public policy, business,
and social work to apply.
Check out my
website, where you can find internship requirements and application
materials. For more information, please call (479) 464-0446 or email
pam.forester@mail.house.gov .
WEEK IN REVIEW
I started off this week in my Rogers
office. Thanks to Jennifer Allison with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network
and the Arkansas Diabetes Association for coming by! Afterwards, I
headed over to Rogers New Tech High School to get a complete tour
of the newest high school in Rogers ! I appreciate
Dr. Darr, Deputy Superintendent Sparks, and Principal Arbuckle showing
me around. I ended the day by attending a roundtable at the Main Street
Rogers office and touring some of the revitalization projects on
which they are working!
On Tuesday, I hit the road and headed to the
easternmost
part of the Third District, where I took the Peel
Ferry - the last public ferryboat operating in Arkansas - over to a town
hall meeting at the Lazy Acres Fire Department. Thank you to all who
came out to visit with me! From there, I attended the monthly Boone
County Recovery Project meeting. You can read about it in the Harrison
Daily Times (stories
here
and
here ). After swinging by Z
Radio ( interview here ), I
wrapped up the day at RockTenn, an integrated producer of corrugated and
consumer packaging and recycling solutions located in
Harrison.
I spent Wednesday in
Fort Smith to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the U.S. Marshals
Service and break ground on the U.S. Marshals Service Museum. The museum
will be funded in part by the sale of commemorative coins authorized
by the United States Marshals Service 225th Anniversary Commemorative
Coin Act (P.L. 112-104).
I introduced this bill, which directed
the secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $5 gold, $1 silver, and
half-dollar clad coins emblematic of the 225 years of exemplary and
unparalleled achievements of the U.S. Marshals Service, in the U.S.
House of Representatives by on March 2, 2011. It was signed into law on
April 2, 2012, and the coins will be available next year. Last week, I
went down to the House Floor to wish the U.S. Marshals a happy 225th
anniversary.

read more about the groundbreaking

After the groundbreaking, I visited Umarex
to tour its new production lines and finished the day by touring
Chaffee Crossing.
On
Thursday, after sharing breaking with my friend Jeff Pipkin, I headed to
Rockline Industries, a consumer product manufacturing company that
makes a wide variety of products, including baby wipes, coffee, and baking
cups, in Russellville.
Afterwards, I participated in Inglewood
Manors ribbon cutting celebration and spoke to the Pottsville High
School seniors. I concluded the day by sharing coffee with the citizens
of Dover at Coffee with the Congressman. Thanks to the great crowd who
came out!
Tomorrow, Ill be attending the
Northwest Arkansas Walk to Defeat ALS . I hope to see you
there! Thanks for a great week, Third District!
