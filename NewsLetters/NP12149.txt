Dear Friend,
FACT: The federal minimum wage at $7.25/hour is no longer a livable
wage. It has been seven years since Congress last increased it, and I
believe it is past time we did so.
That is why I cosponsored H.R.
1010, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, to increase the minimum wage
nationwide to $10.10/hour by 2015.
It is the right thing to do for working families and the right thing to
do to strengthen our economy. Leading economists have found that
modestly raising the minimum wage increases earnings and reduces
poverty without jeopardizing employment.
Further, an increase to the minimum wage will lift more than 4.5
million Americans out of poverty, according to a study released by the
University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Contrary to what many believe,
most minimum wage earners are not teenagers and nearly forty percent
are over the age of 30 - and they rely on this wage to support their
family.

should raise the federal minimum wage.
