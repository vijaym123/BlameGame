 for the November ballot to legalize marijuana in D.C.
Republicans tried to prevent D.C. from voting on a marijuana legalization initiative in 1998, and after voters approved it, blocked its implementation with an appropriations rider for more than 10 years.
I was able to get the rider removed, but we still face challenges with congressional meddling.
We have already begun working with our allies to protect the will of D.C. voters.
I will continue to fight, as I have done year after year, against any congressional attempt to block the District from exercising democracy and its right to self-government.
Working to Solve Local Postal Service Issues
On Wednesday, my D.C. Postal Service Roundtable
brought together the District of Columbia Postmaster, Gerald A. Roane; Cynthia Goodwin of the National Association of Letter Carriers; Dena Briscoe of the American Postal Workers Union; ANC 3F Chairman Adam Tope; and Brennan Dorn and Gail Broeckel, two District residents who shared their experiences with local postal service in the city.
Among the recommendations were:
*
Quarterly Postmaster meetings with ANCs;
*
Setting up an automated phone system for residents who want only routine information, such as operating hours, freeing up customer service representatives to handle substantive issues;
*
Creating a Postal Ombudsman to focus on recurring customer reports in order to detect patterns of service problems; and
*
Getting State Department assistance in processing passports using postal office personnel

I will also call in the U.S. Postal Inspector on the use of mail for drugs, which can lead to attacks on letter carriers.
Do you have suggestions to improve D.C. postal service?
I encourage you to email them to NortonEvents@mail.house.gov
with Post Office Improvement in the subject line, and they will be forwarded directly to the D.C. Postmaster.
Keeping the CSX Virginia Avenue Tunnel Project Transparent and Accountable
Last Monday, I sent a letter
to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Acting Administrator Gregory G. Nadeau urging him to delay the issuance of the CSX Virginia Avenue Tunnel Projects Record of Decision (ROD) until September 15, 2014, to allow oversight of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) by the D.C. Council, which has requested more time to do so.
Many residents have raised concerns about the proposed tunnel construction, which would run close to their homes.
I asked for the delay as a courtesy to the D.C. Council so they can fulfil their obligation to D.C. residents to keep the project transparent and accountable.
I have already had two town meetings on the tunnel.
First U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit
On Tuesday, I attended the inaugural U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and dinner , held in a huge decorated tent on the White House lawn.
The dinner culminated a summit that brought together African dignitaries, policymakers, and leaders to discuss relations between the nations, as well as matters of economic growth and sustainability, climate change, womens issues, and health.
My interest in Africa goes back to my work in the Free South Africa Movement before I was elected to Congress.
Last year, I was in the congressional delegation to Nelson Mandelas funeral in South Africa.
