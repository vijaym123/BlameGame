Week in Review
Dear Friends,
As always, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Below is an update from my busy week in Central New York and in Washington.
Honoring a Central New York Legend
As many of you know, we lost a Central New York radio legend last week in the passing of WSYR Radio host, Joe Galuski.
It was my honor to speak on the floor of the House of Representatives this week to pay tribute to his life.
You can
read my remarks here , and watch them below.
On the Floor
This week, the House passed bipartisan legislation combining several legislative proposals --
including legislation that I cosponsored earlier this Congress
-- to strengthen our human trafficking laws.
Human trafficking is a modern-day version of slavery, and as a former federal prosecutor I've seen its horrors within the United States.
I'm proud to support legislation to combat these heinous crimes and provide much-needed services for victims. This legislation has passed the Senate and will be sent to the President's desk.
Congressional Art Competition Winner
I was pleased to announce Loren Brown, a Marcellus student who attends Manlius Pebble Hill School, as the winner of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition!
This year my district offices received over 30 entries. I was truly impressed by the high caliber of local talent from Central New York art students. Thanks to all who participated!
You can
read more about this year's art competition here .
Loren Brown (center) was joined by her parents and art teacher at a ceremony last weekend.
Around the District
Last weekend, Robin and I enjoyed a wonderful morning at the Williamson Flying Club's annual pancake breakfast.
This is one of my favorite events in Wayne County each year!
I hosted a Service Academy Information session
for high school students, parents, and teachers to learn more about the application and nomination process for the U.S. Military Academies.
Great turnout and interest from our local students!
I started off a full day in Wayne County this morning
with a great breakfast at Konstantinou's Restaurant in Ontario!
Happy Memorial Day!
As we celebrate Memorial Day weekend with barbecues and parades, let us not forget the many brave men and women who have given their lives in defense of our great nation.
Please join Robin and I in taking time this weekend to pay tribute to those who have sacrificed in the name of freedom and democracy.
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
Member of Congress
