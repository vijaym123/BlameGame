Wicker: Presidential
Overreach
Represents Constitutional
'Crisis'
Speaker Boehner Fights to Restore Checks
and
Balances With Lawsuit Against the
President
The U.S. Constitution clearly separates
the powers granted to our three branches of government.
This
includes entrusting the President with the responsibility to "take Care
that the Laws be faithfully executed."
President Obama, like every member of Congress, took an
oath to adhere to the principles in our founding document.
The
unilateral actions of his Administration, however, continue to defy the
Constitution's authority and its checks and balances on power.
GOP Challenge 'A Welcome
Change'
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) recently
announced that he plans to file a lawsuit against President Obama on
the grounds that the President has not upheld his oath of office.
The legislation to authorize the suit is expected to come for a vote
in the House of Representatives in the coming days.
It
specifically challenges the Administration's decision to delay the employer
mandate in the health-care law without the approval of Congress.
Under the Constitution, the legislative branch has the sole authority to
write, amend, and pass
laws.
Respected legal scholars have expressed support for the House effort.
Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University,
described a "growing crisis in our constitutional system" during a
recent hearing before the House Rules Committee.
He said, "After
years of eroding legislative authority, the decision of this body to take
a stand and seek judicial review is a welcome change."
Litany of Autocratic
Orders
The year-long delay of the employer mandate
which requires
employers to provide health insurance if they have 50 or more full-time
employees
is just one example of how the Administration has altered
provisions of the health-care law as it sees fit.
In fact, the
Galen Institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization,
counts at least two dozen Obamacare changes that the President has made
unilaterally.
The egregious
overreach does not stop there.
President Obama's end-run around
Congress affects a broad swath of public policy, from education to
foreign policy.
Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in the
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) execution of the President's
radical climate agenda.
At a
recent Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing, I
expressed my strong opposition to a proposed EPA rule designed to limit carbon
dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants.
The
rule is not only costly but also of dubious legality under the Clean Air
Act.
It far exceeds the agency's regulatory authority, in
addition to having no effect on the climate.
Preserving the
Integrity of our
Democracy
President Obama continually defends his executive orders by
pointing to the political gridlock in Congress.
Earlier this year, he
boasted "I've got a pen" when encouraging his Cabinet to find avenues
for governing by administrative
fiat.
The President may find it politically expedient to change
the laws he disagrees with and to choose the ones he wants to obey.
But overstepping the bounds of the Constitution is a direct
affront to the integrity of our democracy and sets a dangerous precedent.
As elected representatives of the American people, Congress is
compelled to protect these cherished rights.
Litigation to require
that the President faithfully execute the law is important to keeping
the Constitution's separation of powers
intact.
