Friend-
Wanted to let you know that I am supporting a new bill called The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act ( H.R. 528 ), which protects Americans ability to hunt and fish on federal land.
Currently, there are no guarantees in place to direct U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to either facilitate hunting opportunities or to assess the impacts of other activities on existing hunting opportunities.
This bill changes that by requiring USFS and BLM officials to facilitate opportunities and access on their lands for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. It also requires them to evaluate the land and resource planning documents in regards to the impacts of proposed actions on hunting opportunities.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
To further support Americans Second Amendment rights, I have cosponsored The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act ( H.R. 986 ) to strengthen law abiding citizens rights who have concealed carry permits in their home states to legally bring their firearms into any other state with concealed carry laws. Under the bill, gun owners would still be required to comply with any concealed carry laws in any state they are visiting.
