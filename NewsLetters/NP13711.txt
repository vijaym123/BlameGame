Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Native American Veterans' Memorial
The House this week unanimously approved my legislation that allows
construction of a memorial to Native American veterans on the grounds
of the National Museum of the American Indian. H.R. 2319, the Native
American Veterans' Memorial Amendments Act of 2013, passed the House
with a bipartisan vote of 398-0.
I have heard from people I represent and from outside our district that
the construction of this memorial means a great deal to Native
Americans who served this nation and to their families. It is important
that we properly honor these brave soldiers and tell their stories for
generations to come.
Click the photo below to hear my remarks on the House floor while
presenting H.R. 2319.
The memorial cannot be paid for with taxpayer funds, so H.R. 2319
allows for the museum to raise money for its construction. The
legislation has received overwhelming support from the National
Congress of American Indians and the National Museum of the American
Indian.

from tribal leaders, visit http://1.usa.gov/1fl9YDf
.
Budget Deal
This week the House approved a budget deal that stemmed from
negotiations between Senator Patty Murray and Congressman Paul Ryan.
As a business owner, I could not in good faith support legislation that
increases spending and fails to achieve a balanced budget. For our
country to move forward and get out of the hole we are in, we must
focus on reigning in spending and decreasing the size of government.

agreement.
NDAA
This week the House overwhelming approved H.R. 441, the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I voted in support of the National
Defense Authorization Act. Among many things, the Act supports current
law allowing troop pay to keep pace with the private sector, as well as
preventing new fees and increases to TRICARE. Important to many
Oklahomans, the legislation expands religious freedom protections for
chaplains and service members to include beliefs and the expression of
beliefs.
H.R. 441 provides funding for modernization of National Guard and
Reserve equipment as well as increasing spending, beyond what President
Obama requested, for our homeland missile defense system. In light of
what happened in Benghazi in 2012, the legislation also requires a
report from the Department of Defense on the readiness of American
military forces to respond to attacks on American embassies overseas.
The bill also requires the Pentagon to give a minimum of 120 days'
notice prior to deployment and no less than 180 days' notice prior to
cancellation of deployment for the operational reserves. For reserve
soldiers and their families, as much advance notice as possible about
an upcoming deployment would be tremendously helpful and allow them
make the necessary preparations in their civilian lives prior to a
deployment.
Christmas Message to Troops
Christmas can be difficult on our military men and women as they spend
this special time of year away from family and friends. Their selfless
sacrifice allows us to live in freedom each day. We thank you, troops,
for dedicating your time and talents to this great nation. Merry
Christmas!

Kids First Research Act
This week I had the opportunity to cosponsor and support H.R. 2019, the
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. H.R. 2019 redirects federal
funds from political conventions to vital pediatric medical research.
The bipartisan legislation, which passed the House by a vote of
295-103, amends the IRS Code to end public funding of presidential
nominating conventions and instead directs the money for pediatric
research.
Taxpayers should not be footing the bill for political conventions.
Using the funds instead for research to find causes and potential cures
for some of the serious pediatric illnesses affecting children is money
well-spent and can help save lives.
Original estimates from the Congressional Budget Office projected an
appropriation of approximately $13 million per year over the span of
2014-2023 for pediatric research. The bill also makes clear the funds
are to supplement, not take the place of funds otherwise allocated by
the National Institutes of Health for pediatric research.
I had a great discussion this week at the Oklahoma Broadcasters
Luncheon in Tulsa.

the
House
approved
a
budget
deal
that
stemmed

negotiations

As

achieve
a
balanced

For
our
country

we
must
focus
on
reigning
in

NDA A
This
week
the
House
overwhelming
approved
H.R.
441,
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA).
I
voted in
support
of the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
Among
many
things,
the
Act
supports
current
law
allowing
troop
pay
to
keep
pace
with
the
private
sector,
as
well
as
preventing
new
fees
and
increases
to
TRICARE.
Important
to
many
Oklahomans,
the
legislation
expands
religious
freedom
protections
for
chaplains
and
service
members
to
include
beliefs
and
the
expression
of
beliefs.
H.R.
441
provides
funding
for
modernization
of
National
Guard
and
Reserve
equipment
as
well
as
increasing
spending,
beyond
what
President
Obama
requested,
for
our
homeland
missile
defense
system.
In
light
of
what
happened
in
Benghazi
in
2012,
the
legislation
also
requires
a
report
from
the
Department
of
Defense
on
the
readiness
of
American
military
forces
to
respond
to
attacks
on
American
embassies
overseas.
The
bill
also
requires
the
Pentagon
to
give
a
minimum
of
120
days&#8217;
notice
prior
to
deployment
and
no
less
than
180
days&#8217;
notice
prior
to
cancellation
of
deployment
for
the
operational
reserves.
For
reserve
soldiers
and
their
families,
as
much
advance
notice
as
possible
about
an
upcoming
deployment
would
be
tremendously
helpful
and
allow
them
make
the
necessary
preparations
in
their
civilian
lives
prior
to
a
deployment.
Christmas
Message
to
Tr oo ps
Christmas
can
be
difficult
on
our
military
men
and
women
as
they
spend
this
special
time
of
year
away
from
family
and
friends.
Their
selfless
sacrifice
allows
us
to
live in
freedom each
day.
We
thank
you,
troops,
for
dedicating
your
time
and
talents
to
this
great
nation.
Merry
Christmas!
