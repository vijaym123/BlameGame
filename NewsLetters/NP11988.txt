This week, the House voted on a series of bills aimed at ending government abuse.
The House considered three bills to rein in the authority of the IRS and provide transparency regarding how taxpayer dollars are being spent.
The Taxpayer Transparency Act will require federal agencies to disclose if taxpayer dollars are spent for advertisements sponsored or materials provided. The Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act
bans the IRS from questioning taxpayers regarding religious, social, or political beliefs .
Finally, the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act would block the IRS from finalizing rules that would limit the free speech of 501(c)(4) organizations.
The IRS, whose mission statement pledges to enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all, has broken the American peoples trust by targeting conservative groups based solely on their political perspective. Its not just common sense, its critical, that consequences ensue and that we ensure this does not happen again.
Yours in service,
Randy

This week, I also sent a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and submitted a public comment opposing the IRS proposed rule which would restrict the First Amendment rights of 501(c)(4) nonprofit and faith-based organizations. Learn more,
