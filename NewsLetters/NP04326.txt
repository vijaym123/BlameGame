Dear Friend,
This past week, President Obama
announced that he reached an agreement with
China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Unfortunately, the agreement is essentially
an empty promise that does not bind China,
the worlds largest emitter of
greenhouse gases, to uphold its end of the
deal.
China has pledged to cap its rising
carbon emissions by 2030, and set a lofty
and seemingly unrealistic goal of growing
non-fossil fuels to 20percent of the
countrys domestic energy supply by
2030. According to the most recent data,
China relies on fossil fuels for
approximately 92 percent of its total
energy consumption. President Obama stated
that the United States will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by26 to
28percent below 2005 levels by 2025.
Previously, his target was 17percent
by 2020. While it appears that China will
not be held accountable or required to act
for years, Ohioans and Americans across the
country will face the consequences of
President Obamas plan, which will
lead to job losses and a weakened economic
recovery.
Ohio has already experienced the
negative effects of President Obamas
attacks on affordable energy. Burdensome
regulations handed down by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have
led to the closure of coal-fired plants in
and around Ohios 16th district. The
administrations recent actions will
only lead to the closure of more plants,
the loss of more jobs, and higher energy
costs for hardworking Ohioans who are
struggling to make ends meet. In fact, in
2009, President Obama said that under his
energy plan, electricity rates would
necessarily skyrocket. As we enter
the winter months, higher energy costs are
the last thing Ohioans need at a time when
too many are unemployed or
underemployed.
Though the White House has acknowledged
that the United States has reduced its
total greenhouse gas emissions more than
any other nation since 2005, it continues
to charge forward with new regulations.
That is why we in the House of
Representatives have remained committed to
reducing the squeeze on hardworking
families by promoting an all-of-the-above
energy policy that will bring down the cost
of energy, strengthen our energy security,
and ultimately lead to our energy
independence. Additionally, we have passed
several bills that will rein in the
EPAs overreach to preserve jobs and
protect our domestic energy supply. This
includes the Regulations From the Executive
in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, a bill
that will require Congress to approve any
major regulation that that will have more
than a $100 million impact on the economy.
Furthermore, this week we will vote on
legislation that would prohibit the EPA
from finalizing a regulation unless the
data used is made public and bring
much-needed transparency to the EPA
permitting process.
As a father of three, I understand the
importance of preserving the environment
for the next generation. However, President
Obamas recent unilateral action is
ingrained in politics, not policy, as
evidenced by the vague terms of the deal,
which lacks enforcement altogether. We need
to work together to come up with real
solutions that will protect our environment
and the jobs Ohioans and Americans
everywhere rely on.
