Protect VETS
On Monday afternoon, I visited the
First Troop Philadelphia City Calvary Armory
to discuss my bipartisan efforts to restore federal employment and job training services for America's veterans.
My colleague Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and I introduced the " Protect VETS Act " to ensure that veterans continue to have access to specialized job assistance coaches. These coaches work with businesses to develop job opportunities for veterans, and they help veterans find work - especially disabled veterans who have different employment needs.
Thank you to all who joined me:
Scott Brown - Director, City of Philadelphia Veterans Advisory Committee
Joe Eastman - Community Liaison Officer at the Veterans Group
Alex Archawski - Founder of the Greater Philadelphia Veterans Network
Harry Gobora - Founder and Secretary of the Board, Wall Street Warfighters
Phil Dehennis - Pennsylvania National Guard
Desmond Smith - Former United States Marine Corps Drill Instructor
Working To End Alzheimer's
Most people I meet in Pennsylvania are familiar with Alzheimer's disease, but they may not know just how widespread it is.
Pennsylvania has the fifth-highest statewide total in the nation of people suffering from Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. However, our great state is also a leader in the commitment of volunteers and caregivers to fight it.
I sat down recently with
Dr. Francis Collins , Director of the
National Institutes of Health . We discussed funding for Alzheimer's research and ways we can work together to defeat this debilitating disease.
Supporting Small Business
Small businesses are the backbone of our state's economy. It's important for us to ensure these businesses have what they need to expand and grow jobs.
Thank you to Dan Danner, President and CEO of the
National Federation of Independent Business , for recognizing
my support
of small businesses by naming me a Guardian of Small Business! (Photo credit: Eric Reller)
Good News For Our First Responders
This summer, I had the privilege of touring the Bloomsburg Fire Department station. I always enjoy meeting with the brave Pennsylvanians who serve as firefighters and emergency responders.
Late last week, I received word that Lake Meade Fire and Rescue in Adams County received a $144,000 Assistance to Firefighters Grant. Our firefighters embody public service in their dedicated work to ensure the safety of others. I was pleased to support their grant application.
If you belong to a fire department or emergency response organization and would like more information on Assistance to Firefighters Grants, please contact my Allentown office at (610) 434-1444. I am proud to support these brave men and women across Pennsylvania.
