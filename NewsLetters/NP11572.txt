Dear Friend,
I just arrived home
after heading straight from the airport to visit the site of the
massive explosion in East Harlem. While Congress is still in session,
I could not possibly sleep in Washington knowing of the tragic loss
of life and injuries caused by the shocking explosion that occurred in
the heart of our District. As we continue to pray for the families of
those killed or injured in today's catastrophic explosion, my staff
and I are taking immediate action to help the displaced and those in
need. Many thanks go out to the outstanding rescue workers and first
responders who have been on the scene saving lives, controlling the fire,
and dealing with the aftermath of the explosion. We are closely
monitoring the situation, and we are in constant communications with our
federal, state and local partners as events
unfold.
I have spoken to Gov. Cuomo and will work with him to secure
assistance for the victims, families and small business owners. I
thank Mayor de Blasio for his quick response to provide expedient
assistance to the community and Assemblyman Robert Rodriguez who came down
from Albany to help as well.
Together with the Governor, we will
keep the President apprised of the situation as we follow up with the
NTBS (National Transportation Safety Board) team's
investigation.
My staff and I are also working with clergy
and other community leaders, including Matthew Washington of Community
Board 11 to assist in the relief efforts. They are collecting donations
of food and clothing only. All monetary donations should go to the
Red Cross, which has set-up a Reception Center at P.S. 57, located at
176 East 115 th
Street (between Lexington Avenue and
3 rd
Avenue). I am thankful to the Red Cross personnel
who have provided medical and mental health services as well as
meals. Residents seeking information on loved ones who may have been
affected by todays tragic events are urged to call 311 or my office at
212-663-3900.
I am proud to represent a District
where people have opened up their homes and offered hands to help
their neighbors in any way. I know that we are a resilient community and
hope for a swift recovery for all those affected by this tragic
unexpected event.
