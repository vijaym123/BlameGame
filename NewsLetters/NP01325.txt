Thanks to
Citizens United , right-wing billionaires and corporate special interests can spend unlimited amounts of money to buy elections.
That&rsquo;s why Hillary Clinton just joined Democrats across the country in the fight to stop
Citizens United
once and for all. Cheri and Hillary are in complete agreement -- we need a Constitutional Amendment to overturn this disastrous decision.
But David, we need you with us. Will you sign your name to overturn
Citizens United ?
