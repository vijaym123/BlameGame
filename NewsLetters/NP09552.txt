Dear
Friend,
I am deeply disappointed to
hear the allegations of Veterans Affairs officials potentially
falsifying information on long appointment wait times for veterans seeking
care at VA facilities.
If
proven true, these allegations would be an outrageous betrayal of the
publics trust and a dereliction of the governments basic obligation to
take care of our soldiers after their service. Our veterans deserve
answers and immediate action.
More
than one week ago I wrote to the Director of the Edward Hines, Jr. VA
Hospital asking for answers, but I also want to hear directly from
you.
Have you or someone you know experienced long wait times
while trying to schedule an appointment at a VA facility in
Illinois?
You can let me know by clicking here to fill out a
short survey.
Our veterans put their lives on the line to defend
our country, and it is our duty to ensure they get the care and
respect they deserve when they come home. As your representative in the
United States Congress, I am committed to ensuring that
happens.
Remember I am here to work for you. If
you have any questions, or concerns please feel free to
e-mail me , call our office, or connect with me on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Bill
Foster
Member of
Congress
