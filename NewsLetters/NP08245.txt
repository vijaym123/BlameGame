David,
I know you&rsquo;re getting quite a few emails from us lately. Ok, a whole
lot
of emails.
They usually go like this: &ldquo;SuperPACs! Kochs! Deadlines!&rdquo;
So let me step back for a moment. I take pride in fighting for the issues you care about most
-- from growing our economy, to protecting our environment, to helping women earn equal pay for equal work.
I want to keep fighting for Illinois -- for you. But outside groups and right-wing special interests are gearing up to spend an unprecedented amount of money to try and defeat us.
Tomorrow at midnight we have a critical FEC fundraising deadline. And so far, we&rsquo;ve been neck and neck with Republican Bob Dold every step of the way.
To pull ahead, we must have a strong showing. David, this is my first reelection campaign. If you&rsquo;re able, please make a donation before midnight tomorrow and help me keep fighting for Illinois. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Together, we
will
be successful.
Thanks,
Brad
P.S. The FEC deadline is tomorrow and we&rsquo;re within reach of having our best quarter yet.
Can you please chip in a few dollars to help us out?
