Hello
Friends!
In March, Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Chair
Marcia Fudge and I
sent a letter to
Rep. Paul Ryan
inviting him to discuss poverty with the CBC. This
week, that highly anticipated meeting occurred. My fellow Wisconsinite
Paul Ryan is a nice guy, and I am glad that we had an opportunity to
discuss poverty. But the conversation will not stop this week. Our
meeting was just the first step towards moving past rhetoric and
effecting real change in our communities. Learn more about our meeting and
other recent news
