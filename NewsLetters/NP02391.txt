Hello,
Here's a rundown of some important things that happened in
Congress this week and a look at some events ahead.
Department of Homeland Security
Funding
In November, President
Obama bypassed Congress and issued an executive action on
immigration.
As I was then, I remain opposed to this
Presidential overreach and thus I voted against legislation that would enable
the Presidents executive amnesty to go into effect.
Taking Care of Our
Veterans
On Monday the House passed two important bills
aimed at solving problems for our veterans.
The first bill,
H.R. 294, the Long-Term Care
Veterans Choice Act , authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs
to enter into agreements or contracts with a certified medical foster
home to pay for long-term care for 900 eligible veterans.
For veterans who want a smaller, more familial
and community oriented setting, medical foster home care is a
long-term alternative. The VA, however, does not have the authority to pay for
this option. That puts veterans who want to go this route into a bind
and often forces the VA to move veterans into nursing homes, which
ends up costing the VA more money.
This bill changes that problem by expanding health care choices
for our veterans, giving them more freedom and more options in their
health care decisions.
The second bill
we passed helps pay for this change. When we learned about the
scandals at the VA last year, we also learned that over $380,000 in bonuses
had been paid to top executives at hospitals that were falsifying wait
times for our veterans.
I think
everyone would agree that if you receive a bonus under false pretenses,
you should have to give the money back. I certainly think that's the
case.
But, in typical Washington
fashion, the VA Secretary doesn't have the authority to recoup those
bonuses. So we passed
H.R. 280 , which gives the VA
Secretary the authority to recoup those
bonuses.
Prime Minister Netanyahu's
Speech
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu came and spoke before a joint meeting of Congress.
It was an honor to hear directly from him how grave the threats are
in the Middle East, and the importance of ensuring a nuclear free Iran.
Now, more than ever, we need real leadership. So it was a no brainer
for me to attend the speech to see a true leader speak and show my
support for our greatest friend and ally,
Israel.
School Tours
On Wednesday, I had the chance to meet with students from Gilmour
Academy's Constitutional Law class who were visiting DC. Our office helped
coordinate a tour of the U.S. Capitol and I presented them with a
flag that had been flown over the United States Capitol. If you know that
students from a local school will be coming to Washington, don't
hesitate to reach out to
Ken
in our office and we'll
be happy to help set up a tour for them.
Small Business Seminar
On Thursday, I will be hosting a Small Business Seminar in
Brecksville. We will present an overview of U.S. Small Business Administration,
Ohio Small Business Development Center, SCORE and the U.S. Export
Assistance Center programs and services.The event will include such
topics as selling to the federal government, SBA loan programs, municipal
economic development, exporting, and technical
assistance.
A panel of lenders will also discuss credit
decision variables and the session will end with a question and answer
period.
The details are below and I
hope to see you there.
It is an honor to serve
you,
Dave
