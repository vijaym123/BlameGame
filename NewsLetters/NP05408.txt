Im sure you saw that the Supreme Court
allowed lower court decisions to stand
in five cases, overturning state same-sex marriage bans.
Here are my thoughts: In 2013, the Supreme Court left the task of defining marriage to the states. This week, by refusing to hear cases from five states
including Virginia
seeking to uphold their definition of marriage as one man and one woman, the Court has refused the citizens of these states the opportunity to defend democratically enacted laws defining traditional marriage.
Cases are still pending before several federal circuits and it is likely that the Supreme Court will be asked to consider this issue again.
It is my hope that the judicial process will be respected and that the Court allows the citizens of these states the opportunity to be heard.
Yours in service,
Randy
