Do you agree with President Obama's student loan repayment reform?
Yes - We must do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions
Maybe - Each State should decide emission levels for their coal-fired
power plants.
No - Coal-fired power plants have enough regulations as is.

It was another busy week on Capitol Hill, as Congress debated and voted
on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development (THUD -
pronounced "tee-HUD") Appropriations Bill. This bill allocates
previously-approved federal funds to critical agencies and programs,
such as the Federal Aviation Administration, Amtrak, National
Transportation Safety Board, and housing programs for our nation's most
vulnerable Americans.
Regrettably, this bill contained harmful cuts to the Maritime Security
Program, Federal Aviation Administration, Fair Housing and Equal
Opportunity Program, Amtrak, and TIGER grants, which are critical to
maintaining the competitiveness of the Port of Long Beach. For these
reasons, I voted "no" on the THUD bill. It ultimately passed along
party lines, 229-192.
This week marked the 51st anniversary of President John F. Kennedy
signing the Equal Pay Act of 1963 into law. This historic law set us on
a course to narrow-and eventual erase-our nation's unfair wage gap.
While we've made many gains since that day, there still remains much to
be done, as women still earn on average $0.77 for every $1.00 earned by
a man.
Thankfully, in California, that income disparity is not as wide; women
earn $0.85 for every $1.00 earned by a man. That is not enough though.
We must have equal pay for equal work. I am committed to achieving that
reality. That is why I am cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which
prohibits pay discrimination based on gender.
Protecting Endangered Species and National Marine Landmarks
Two weeks ago the House Natural Resources Committee marked-up
amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Act - a law
written for managing our nation's fisheries.
The bill passed along party lines and its provisions were of great
concern, as they supersede longstanding protections for endangered
species and our national marine landmarks.
This is why I offered an amendment that would have kept Marine
Sanctuaries, the Antiquities Act, and the Endangered Species Act from
being superseded by Magnuson-Stevens, which should only be for managing
fisheries.

Thankfully, the Senate is taking a bipartisan approach to
Magnuson-Stevens. I urge our committee leaders to follow suit and work
across party lines to build a bipartisan fisheries bill.
Action on Student Loan Repayments
In California, 52 percent of our college graduates are over $20,000 in
debt. These numbers are appalling.
I am thankful that the President has announced the expansion of a
program that allows students to have their monthly loan repayments
capped at 10 percent of their annual income. This translates into more
graduates having more money in their pockets to help start their
careers and contribute to the economy.
To build upon this new development for our students, I have also become
a cosponsor of the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act
. While the President's
plan is good to students with new loans, the Bank on Students Emergency
Loan Refinancing Act allows students with current loans to renegotiate
their repayments as a capped percentage of their income.

Israel's New President & My Meeting with the Ambassador
Congratulations to Israel's President-elect Reuven Rivlin, whose long
record of service to the State of Israel will benefit the Israeli
people for years to come. I wish President Shimon Peres only the best
as he finishes his term, and I look forward to continuing the strong
partnership our nation has with Israel.
On Thursday, I met with Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Ron
Dermer, to discuss the leadership transition, the peace process,
and
how we can continue working together on issues of mutual interest.
Meeting with Ambassador Ron Dermer
Voting "Present"
When a bill is being considered on the House Floor, Members of Congress
vote on an electronic recording device. The device has three voting
options: YEA, NAY, and PRES. In this case, "PRES" means "present."
Voting present is essentially a refusal to take a side on a particular
vote, and it does not count towards or against the final passage of a
bill.
Members of Congress often vote present as a party in order to showcase
the views of the opposing party to the general public. While voting
present is always an option, it is rarely used by many Members. As for
me, I prefer to have my vote, either "yea" or "nay," on record for my
constituents to see where I stand on a particular issue.
Should the federal government regulate greenhouse gas emissions from
coal-fired power plants?
50.7% - Yes - We must do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions
12.5% - Maybe - Each State should decide emission levels for their
coal-fired power plants.
33.1% - No - Coal-fired power plants have enough regulations as is.
