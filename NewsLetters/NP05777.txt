Dear David,
While the U.S. economy has
made great strides in recovering from the Great Recession, some
homeowners are still struggling to hold on to the American dream of owning a
home. In response to the housing crisis in 2009, the Federal Housing
Finance Agency (FHFA) created the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or
HARP, to help qualified homeowners refinance their mortgages and
potentially save thousands of dollars each year. HARP is a perfect example
of the type of relief Americans need from the federal government to
jumpstart our economy and ensure a stable middle class.
Here
in Rochester, over one thousand homeowners qualify for the program
but have yet to take advantage of this popular and effective program.
Data from the FHFA reveals homeowners who refinance through HARP save an
average of $191 a month on their mortgages. With recent changes to
simplify and streamline the program to approve more loans and with
interest rates still at historic lows, now is the time for homeowners to
act before the program expires at the end of 2015.
To
qualify, you must be current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments
in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months,
your loan must have originated on or before May 31, 2009 and be owned by
Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, and your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio
must be greater than 80 percent. To check if you qualify, please visit
http://harp.gov/Eligibility .
I
strongly urge you to spread the word about the opportunity to refinance
qualified mortgages to those you know. If my office can be help with this
or other matters, please call us at 585-232-4850.
Best,
Louise M.
