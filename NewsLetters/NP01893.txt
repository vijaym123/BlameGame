New York Times : &ldquo;Major Races in the Senate Get an Early Start.&rdquo; The Koch Brothers are in -- are you??

David -- You&rsquo;ve stood up for progressive values in the past. So we were surprised to see that you haven&rsquo;t renewed as a 2015 DSCC member yet:
DSCC Membership Status:

2015 Membership Rate:

(renew now)
Deadline:
24 hours
It&rsquo;s a disaster -- this Republican-controlled Congress is attacking Social Security and Medicare, undermining President Obama&rsquo;s authority, and obstructing any progressive legislation.
But we&rsquo;re fighting back:
Our
Back to Blue project
will go into swing states to hammer vulnerable Republican incumbents for their failed policies, push a strong progressive agenda (raise the minimum wage, ensure equal pay, protect Social Security, etc.), and elect a Democratic president and Senate who will pass this agenda into law.
It&rsquo;s a one-two-three punch.
Our kick-off date is April 1 -- 24 HOURS FROM NOW. But we still need to raise $200,000 from grassroots supporters!!
Will you renew your membership TODAY so we can launch Back to Blue? We CANNOT miss this opportunity to take the White House and Senate and get our Democratic agenda passed!
