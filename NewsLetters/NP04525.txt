Friends,
Just last
month, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial opened right
across the street from my D.C. office. Visiting the Memorial reminded
me of the sacrifices our men and women in uniform have made, and the
ones they continue to make each day to protect our
freedom.
Veterans Day honors those who
proudly served our country in the armed forces. We must thank our
heroes not simply by our words, but also by our
actions.
That is why I voted to ensure that
veterans have access to quality health care. Our veterans should not be
forced to wait an unreasonably long time for medical care, and it is
appalling to even think that some have died because of treatment delays
at VA medical centers.
I am pleased that Congress took decisive action to address the
issues that plagued the Department of Veterans Affairs. Together, we
passed the
Veterans Access, Choice &amp; Accountability Act of
2014
to reduce delays.
This law created a pilot program which enables veterans who have
waited at least 30 days for an appointment or who live more than 40
miles from a VA center to obtain care at another medical facility. The law
also allocates additional funding for the VA to hire more specialists
and primary care physicians.
Additionally, the law requires public colleges receiving
G.I. Bill payments to offer in-state tuition to veterans and eligible
dependents, and provides full benefits to spouses of service members who
died in the line of duty after September 11,
2001.
We, as a nation, owe so much to the
men and women defending our freedom at home and abroad. This Veterans
Day, let's
ensure their sacrifices do not go
unnoticed.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
