Friends,
Last week, I voted for the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act and the Secret Science Reform Act, legislation that would help rein in the EPAs continual overreach. When the EPA uses secret science and one-sided debate to justify unnecessary regulations, it has real life consequences for hard-working Americans across the country. Jobs are lost, utility bills skyrocket and it costs more to feed the family. These common sense reforms will help protect the American people from the consequences of EPA overreach.
Waste at the IRS
I questioned IRS Commissioner John Koskinen last Wednesday about the billions of dollars the IRS pays in fraudulent tax returns. I told him that it strikes me as odd that the IRS would, without verification, sent out a refund just because they received a submission through an online portal and deposit that money to an unverified account. But thats what happens. And it costs $5.8 billion every year. Click
