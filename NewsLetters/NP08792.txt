Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Happy Father's Day to all of the fathers and grandfathers out there! I
was blessed to become a father three years ago when Carol and I
welcomed our first daughter, Eleanor, into our lives. Now, as the
father of two beautiful daughters, I can comprehend the enormous love
my father has for me and all fathers have for their children.
I am grateful to my Dad for being a terrific role model for my siblings
and me, and for teaching me what it means to be a father to my girls. I
hope everyone is enjoying family time this weekend with the special men
in their lives!
Working to Provide the Care Veterans Earned
Kentucky veterans have sacrificed so much in service to our nation, and
it's critical that they receive the care they have been promised and
the services they have earned. To ensure that all veterans have the
opportunity to get the care they need, I am glad that on Tuesday, the
House passed H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act of 2014,
legislation that would allow veterans to receive health care from local
non-VA health centers and would enhance VA coordination of this care
received outside of a VA.
This bill and H.R. 3775, the Karen Tufts Military SAVE Act I introduced
last year, would help address the challenges facing the VA by providing
brave veterans the care they have earned.

Celebrating Flag Day at the 11th Annual Military Freedom Fest
The 11th Annual Military Freedom Fest in Nicholasville occurred on Flag
Day, Saturday, June 14th. I was glad to attend this patriotic event and
be able to present two worthy organizations with American flags that
had been flown over the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
I presented the first flag to the Camp Nelson Honor Guard in Jessamine
County. I had the privilege of visiting Camp Nelson earlier this month
and am always astounded by its rich history. This Civil War site
recently received a very deserving National Historic Landmark
Designation.
The second flag was given to the Military Freedom Fest in recognition
for their service to our veterans.
Congress officially adopted Flag Day on August 3, 1949, to commemorate
Old Glory. The American flag continues to be a symbol of freedom and
prosperity, and a poignant reminder of so many service men and women
who paid the ultimate sacrifice. I was grateful to have the opportunity
to celebrate Flag Day in such a meaningful way.
Kentuckians in the Capitol
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the
Nashville Songwriters Association. We were treated to two wonderful
performances of "Southern Girl" and "Automatic" by the original
songwriters, Nicholasville native and Eastern Kentucky University
graduate Lee Thomas Miller of Nicholasville and Nicolle Galyon,
respectively.
It was wonderful to meet the Colson family while they were visiting our
nation's Capitol!
I enjoyed meeting with Roger Leasor of Lexington, a Liquor Barn owner
representing the American Beverage Licensees. Kentucky beverage
retailers play a vital role in the local, state and U.S economies.
These retailers also promote Kentucky beverage products and stimulate
job growth while generating more than $129 million. I look forward to
implementing their ideas and working with Mr. Leasor in the future.
Representatives from Clark and NACCO Materials Handling Group visited
me on National Forklift Safety Day to discuss their efforts to improve
forklift-operation safety as well as the important economic impact of
non-automotive manufacturing in central Kentucky. We also discussed the
importance of expanding export opportunities for Kentucky
manufacturers. I look forward to visiting their respective facilities
in Lexington and Berea in the future.
On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of meeting Timothy McDaniel. Timothy has
been named a "Boren Scholar" by the National Security Education
Program, granting him a scholarship to study abroad in areas critical
to United States National Security such as the Middle East and Africa.
Congratulations to Timothy and I wish him the best in his future
travels and endeavors!
I enjoyed meeting with Marieke Gester on Thursday during her trip to
Washington, DC. Marieke has been living in Lawrenceburg for the past
year as an exchange student from Germany. She is participating in the
American Civics Center Program before returning home to Germany. It was
a pleasure meeting Marieke and I'm glad she has enjoyed her time in the
Commonwealth.
It was great to meet with several Kentucky members of the American
Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. We discussed the Higher
Education Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and
promoting the academic achievement of our students. Their hard work
helps to improve the quality of our teachers and the education that
Kentucky children receive.
Casework Corner: Assisting the Citizen's Fire Academy Alumni
Association
Recently, the Citizen's Fire Academy Alumni Association contacted our
office seeking assistance. The Association works to familiarize the
citizens of Lexington with the many ways the Lexington Fire Department
serves our community. This includes organizing the annual Fire
Department Awards banquet and assisting with Lexington's Fire
Prevention Week. Due to a new IRS regulation, the Association failed to
receive a renewal for its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.
The Association depends on voluntary donations to operate, but the
improper IRS designation began to negatively affect its ability to
raise funds. In April, members of the Association contacted our office
for assistance. We were able help the Association once again receive
tax-exempt status, and now they are able to continue their fundraising
efforts for the many special events they plan each year that benefit
our communities.
If you are having trouble with a federal agency, please contact my
Lexington office at (859) 219-1366, as we may be able to provide
assistance!
Around the District
On Friday, I had the opportunity to volunteer as a mentor for the
Fayette County Veterans Treatment Court, a specialized court that
focuses on the unique needs of veterans with substance abuse and mental
health problems. This national program was started locally in Lexington
in October 2013 by Judge John Schrader, and offers eligible and willing
veterans the chance to undergo intensive, 18-month treatment and
counseling for their physical and psychological problems as an
alternative to simply sending them to jail.
It was such a rewarding experience to spend time with these veterans,
who are working to make a better life for themselves and their families
by completing this innovative program.
I would like to thank Judge John Schrader, Kathy Witt and the Fayette
County Sheriffs Office, the Lexington VA employees and all others who
make this program possible. I would especially like to thank the
veterans that are participants in the program for their sacrifice to
our country.
It was my pleasure to address the 92nd Annual State Conference of the
Kentucky Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, Inc. on
Friday in Lexington. Thank you to President Amanda Ishmael for inviting
me to speak! I always enjoy speaking to groups who are focused on our
economy and developing business opportunities in our region. KFBPW is a
powerful networking group for women in the workforce and I appreciate
their contributions across the state.
On Monday, I was glad to participate in the announcement of nearly $2
million in federal funds for an infrastructure project that will allow
the expansion of Custom Foods/CTI Foods in Bath County. Custom Foods'
expansion is a testament to the workforce available in Eastern
Kentucky. This $44 million private investment and the addition of 200
new, full-time jobs presents an exciting opportunity for this region.
Additionally, I would like to thank EDA Director Phil Paradice for
making the trip from Atlanta to be a part of this celebration.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website
, Facebook
and Twitter
, where you can find regular updates about my work at
home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

Dear
Friend,
Happy
Father&#8217;s
Day
to
all
of
the
fathers
and
grandfathers
out
there!
I
was
blessed
to
become
a
father
three
years
ago
when
Carol
and
I
welcomed
our
first
daughter,
Eleanor,
into
our
lives.
Now,
as
the
father
of
two
beautiful
daughters,
I
can
comprehend
the
enormous
love
my
father
has
for
me
and
all
fathers
have
for
their
children.
I
am
grateful
to
my
Dad
for
being
a
terrific
role
model
for
my
siblings
and
me,
and
for
teaching
me
what
it
means
to
be
a
father
to
my
girls.
I
hope
everyone
is
enjoying
family
time
this
weekend
with
the
special
men
in
their
lives!
Working
to
Provide
the
Care
Veterans
Earned
Kentucky
veterans
have
sacrificed
so
much
in
service
to
our
nation,
and
it's
critical
that
they
receive
the
care
they
have
been
promised
and
the
services
they
have
earned.
To
ensure
that
all
veterans
have
the
opportunity
to
get
the
care
they
need,
I
am
glad
that
on
Tuesday,
the
House
passed
H.R.
4810,
the
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
of
2014,
legislation
that
would
allow

to

health
care
from
local
non-VA
health
centers
and
would
enhance
VA
coordination
of
this
care
received
outside
of
a
VA.
This
bill
and
H.R.
3775,
the
Karen
Tufts
Military
SAVE
Act
I
introduced
last
year,
would
help
address
the
challenges
facing
the
VA
by
providing
brave
veterans
the
care
they
have
earned.

Celebrating
Flag
Day
at
the
11th
Annual
Military
Freedom
Fest
The
11th
Annual
Military
Freedom
Fest
in
Nicholasville
occurred
on
Flag
Day,
Saturday,
June
14th.
I
was
glad
to
attend
this
patriotic
event
and
be
able
to
present
two
worthy
organizations
with
American
flags
that
had
been
flown
over
the
Capitol
in
Washington,
D.C.
I
presented
the
first
flag
to
the
Camp
Nelson
Honor
Guard
in
Jessamine
County.
I
had
the
privilege
of
visiting
Camp
Nelson
earlier
this
month
and
am
always
astounded
by
its
rich
history.
This
Civil
War
site
recently
received
a
very
deserving
National
Historic
Landmark
Designation.
The
second
flag
was
given
to
the
Military
Freedom
Fest
in
recognition
for
their
service
to
our
veterans.
Congress
officially
adopted
Flag
Day
on
August
3,
1949,
to
commemorate
Old
Glory.
The
American
flag
continues
to
be
a
symbol
of
freedom
and
prosperity,
and
a
poignant
reminder
of
so
many
service
men
and
women
who
paid
the
ultimate
sacrifice.
I
was
grateful
to
have
the
opportunity
to
celebrate
Flag
Day
in
such
a
meaningful
way.
Kentuckians
in
the
Capitol
On
Wednesday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
representatives
of
the
Nashville
Songwriters
Association.
We
were
treated
to
two
wonderful
performances
of
&#8220;Southern
Girl&#8221;
and
&#8220;Automatic&#8221;
by
the
original
songwriters,
Nicholasville
native
and
Eastern
Kentucky
University
graduate
Lee
Thomas
Miller
of
Nicholasville
and
Nicolle
Galyon,
respectively.
It
was
wonderful
to
meet
the
Colson
family
while
they
were
visiting
our
nation&#8217;s
Capitol!
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
Roger
Leasor
of
Lexington,
a
Liquor
Barn
owner
representing
the
American
Beverage
Licensees.
Kentucky
beverage
retailers
play
a
vital
role
in
the
local,
state
and
U.S
economies.
These
retailers
also
promote
Kentucky
beverage
products
and
stimulate
job
growth
while
generating
more
than
$129
million.
I
look
forward
to
implementing
their
ideas
and
working
with
Mr.
Leasor
in
the
future.
Representatives
from
Clark
and
NACCO
Materials
Handling
Group
visited
me
on
National
Forklift
Safety
Day
to
discuss
their
efforts
to
improve
forklift-operation
safety
as
well
as
the
important
economic
impact
of
non-automotive
manufacturing
in
central
Kentucky.
We
also
discussed
the
importance
of
expanding
export
opportunities
for
Kentucky
manufacturers.
I
look
forward
to
visiting
their
respective
facilities
in
Lexington
and
Berea
in
the
future.
On
Tuesday,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
Timothy
McDaniel.
Timothy
has
been
named
a
&#8220;Boren
Scholar&#8221;
by
the
National
Security
Education
Program,
granting
him
a
scholarship
to
study
abroad
in
areas
critical
to
United
States
National
Security
such
as
the
Middle
East
and
Africa.
Congratulations
to
Timothy
and
I
wish
him
the
best
in
his
future
travels
and
endeavors!
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
Marieke
Gester
on
Thursday
during
her
trip
to
Washington,
DC.
Marieke
has
been
living
in
Lawrenceburg
for
the
past
year
as
an
exchange
student
from
Germany.
She
is
participating
in
the
American
Civics
Center
Program
before
returning
home
to
Germany.
It
was
a
pleasure
meeting
Marieke
and
I&#8217;m
glad
she
has
enjoyed
her
time
in
the
Commonwealth.
It
was
great
to
meet
with
several
Kentucky
members
of
the
American
Association
of
Colleges
for
Teacher
Education.
We
discussed
the
Higher
Education
Act,
the
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act,
and
promoting
the
academic
achievement
of
our
students.
Their
hard
work
helps
to
improve
the
quality
of
our
teachers
and
the
education
that
Kentucky
children
receive.
Casework
Corner:
Assisting
the
Citizen&#8217;s
Fire
Academy
Alumni
Association
Recently,
the
Citizen&#8217;s
Fire
Academy
Alumni
Association
contacted
our
office
seeking
assistance.
The
Association
works
to
familiarize
the
citizens
of
Lexington
with
the
many
ways
the
Lexington
Fire
Department
serves
our
community.
This
includes
organizing
the
annual
Fire
Department
Awards
banquet
and
assisting
with
Lexington&#8217;s
Fire
Prevention
Week.
Due
to
a
new
IRS
regulation,
the
Association
failed
to
receive
a
renewal
for
its
501(c)(3)
tax-exempt
status.
The
Association
depends
on
voluntary
donations
to
operate,
but
the
improper
IRS
designation
began
to
negatively
affect
its
ability
to
raise
funds.
In
April,
members
of
the
Association
contacted
our
office
for
assistance.
We
were
able
help
the
Association
once
again
receive
tax-exempt
status,
and
now
they
are
able
to
continue
their
fundraising
efforts
for
the
many
special
events
they
plan
each
year
that
benefit
our
communities.
If
you
are
having
trouble
with
a
federal
agency,
please
contact
my
Lexington
office
at
(859)
219-1366,
as
we
may
be
able
to
provide
assistance!
Around
the
District
On
Friday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
volunteer
as
a
mentor
for
the
Fayette
County
Veterans
Treatment
Court,
a
specialized
court
that
focuses
on
the
unique
needs
of
veterans
with
substance
abuse
and
mental
health
problems.
This
national
program
was
started
locally
in
Lexington
in
October
2013
by
Judge
John
Schrader,
and
offers
eligible
and
willing
veterans
the
chance
to
undergo
intensive,
18-month
treatment
and
counseling
for
their
physical
and
psychological
problems
as
an
alternative
to
simply
sending
them
to
jail.
It
was
such
a
rewarding
experience
to
spend
time
with
these
veterans,
who
are
working
to
make
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families
by
completing
this
innovative
program.
I
would
like
to
thank
Judge
John
Schrader,
Kathy
Witt
and
the
Fayette
County
Sheriffs
Office,
the
Lexington
VA
employees
and
all
others
who
make
this
program
possible.
I
would
especially
like
to
thank
the
veterans
that
are
participants
in
the
program
for
their
sacrifice
to
our
country.
It
was
my
pleasure
to
address
the
92nd
Annual
State
Conference
of
the
Kentucky
Federation
of
Business
and
Professional
Women&#8217;s
Clubs,
Inc.
on
Friday
in
Lexington.
Thank
you
to
President
Amanda
Ishmael
for
inviting
me
to
speak!
I
always
enjoy
speaking
to
groups
who
are
focused
on
our
economy
and
developing
business
opportunities
in
our
region.
KFBPW
is
a
powerful
networking
group
for
women
in
the
workforce
and
I
appreciate
their
contributions
across
the
state.
On
Monday,
I
was
glad
to
participate
in
the
announcement
of
nearly
$2
million
in
federal
funds
for
an
infrastructure
project
that
will
allow
the
expansion
of
Custom
Foods/CTI
Foods
in
Bath
County.
Custom
Foods&#8217;
expansion
is
a
testament
to
the
workforce
available
in
Eastern
Kentucky.
This
$44
million
private
investment
and
the
addition
of
200
new,
full-time
jobs
presents
an
exciting
opportunity
for
this
region.
Additionally,
I
would
like
to
thank
EDA
Director
Phil
Paradice
for
making
the
trip
from
Atlanta
to
be
a
part
of
this
celebration.
Please
continue
to
let
me
know
your
thoughts
and
concerns
about
issues
facing
our
community,
and
I
hope
you
will
forward
