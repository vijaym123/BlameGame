I know President Obama just asked for your help -- but now, we&rsquo;ve got another problem our hands:
Boehner&rsquo;s allies just dumped $3.7 million into 4 battleground races.
This is NEW money. This was NOT expected.
And now, I need to make a decision TONIGHT on whether we can respond. David -- I appreciate all you&rsquo;ve done, but I need you one more time. We&rsquo;ve got Democrats out there getting ambushed. I want to be able to back them up -- but that means we have to find an extra $200,000 today. Can you help out? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
