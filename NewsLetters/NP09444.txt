Memorial Day
Honoring Americas War
Dead
This coming Monday, May 26, Americans will once again mark Memorial
Day, a day set aside to honor all those who gave their lives in service
to our nation.
As a grateful nation, we should
always remember that the liberty we enjoy has been paid for, time and
again, by the lives of the hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans
who gave, in Lincolns words, the last full measure of devotion in the
defense of our great country.
And, we always remember
those who still serve here or abroad doing the work of
freedom.
This
article
provides a fascinating look back
at the history of Memorial Day
Tragic Neglect of Our
Veterans at the VA
The growing scandal about the
tragic neglect of patients at numerous Department of Veterans Affairs
hospital facilities, coupled with the attempts to cover-up just how
badly the system is failing our veterans, reveals a true dereliction of
duty by the VA to those men and women who did their duty for
us.
Both Dana Milbank
writing
in the
Washington Post
and Major Garrett
writing
in the
National Journal
are highly critical of the President for ignoring this
crisis for years.
To enable the Department of Veterans
Affairs to move swiftly to replace those responsible for this disgrace, I
joined a strong bipartisan majority of my colleagues in passing H.R.
4031, the 2014 VA Management Accountability Act.
This
bill , if passed by the Senate and signed by the President,
will make it easier for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to fire or
demote senior executives who are failing at their jobs to provide the
best possible care to Americas veterans.
The President has
a sacred duty to fix this disgraceful state of affairs
and fix it
now!
Weak Economic Recovery Leaves Unemployed Deeply
Discouraged
A recent
survey
shows that nearly half of the nations unemployed have given up
looking for a job.
The nations economy is stuck in the
doldrums.
We are experiencing the slowest recovery from a recession (which
ended five years ago) since the Great Depression!
The
Presidents economic policies have done nothing to encourage economic growth
and job creation.
In fact, his administrations policies have
hindered it.
The House has passed 40 bills designed to give the
economy the jump start it needs to start creating jobs.
Unfortunately, these bills are stuck in the Senate.
Its long past
time for the Senate Majority Leader to bring these bills to the Senate
floor.
Obamacare Ready to Use Tax Dollars to Bailout
Insurance Companies
According to an
article
in the
Los Angeles
Times
earlier this week, The Obama administration has quietly adjusted
key provisions of its signature healthcare law to potentially make
billions of additional taxpayer dollars available to the insurance
industry if companies providing coverage through the Affordable Care Act
lose money.
According to a spokeswoman for the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), HHS will use appropriations as
available to fill [any insurance company loss]."
Evidently, the taxes
collected under the 2010 law will still not be enough to cover the costs
of implementation!
This is yet another example of the
underlying flaws in the Affordable Care Act.
In an effort to keep
premiums from rising too far, too fast, the Obama administration is
ready to use even more taxpayer dollars to cover any losses!
This is
nothing more than a shell game designed to make Obamacare seem less
expensive than it is.
Patient Choice a Thing of the
Past Under Obamacare
We have known for some time
that the Presidents promise if you like your doctor you can keep your
doctor was not true.
It turns out the situation is growing
even worse, now that the open enrollment period has
ended.
Reports are coming in that some doctors and hospitals that were in
certain
insurance networks during the enrollment period are
beginning to withdraw from those networks.
This means that even if
you selected a certain policy because your doctor was in that insurance
companys network, theres no guarantee that doctor will stay in your
network.
So what limited choice you had may also be going
away.
This
article
from the Georgetown
University Health Policy Institute provides the details on this latest
Obamacare bait and switch.
Salute: Cedar Crest Field
of Honor
I salute all those at Cedar Crest in
Pequannock Township for creating a stirring display of patriotism in
honor
of all those who have served in Americas
armed forces.
More than 250 full-size American flags are
flying atop 8-foot poles along Cedar Crest Drive off Route 23.
The flags were donated by Cedar Crest residents, staff and local
businesses and will be flying through Memorial Day, May
26 th .
If you are in area, I urge you to drive past and take a
moment to remember all those who have given their lives in the
service of our country.
Salute:

Salute: Picatinny
Arsenal Receives Energy Efficiency

Picatinny Arsenal was awarded recently the 2013 Secretary of the Army Energy
