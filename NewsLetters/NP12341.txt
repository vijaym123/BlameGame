Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Votes to Restore Military Retirement COLA
Today, Congressman Paul Cook voted to restore the full Cost of Living
Adjustment (COLA) to all military retirees. This would undo the recent
reduction in COLA and ensure that all veterans receive the full
benefits which they were promised. The restoration of COLA for veterans
passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming bipartisan vote
and is headed to the Senate for final approval.
Congressman Cook has made restoration of veterans' full COLA a top
legislative priority. He had already voted to restore the full COLA for
disabled veterans and was an original cosponsor of the bill of H.R.
3790, a bill that would eliminate the COLA reduction for all military
retirees.
Said Cook, "While we're in difficult budget times, it's vital that
America keeps its promise to the men and women who have put their lives
on the line defending America. I'm proud to have voted to restore
veterans' cost of living adjustments. The House has taken the first
step, and now it's time for the Senate and President to act quickly to
ensure that America keeps its promise to our veterans."
Congressman Cook Votes for Critical California Drought Relief
Legislation
Last week, Congressman Cook voted for H.R. 3964, the "Sacramento-San
Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act." This vital piece of
legislation addresses the drought in California by cutting through the
bureaucratic red tape, which has prevented timely water delivery to
Southern California. Congressman Cook is an original cosponsor of this
important bill.
California has been in a man-made drought for years as a result of
federal regulations and environmental lawsuits. The recent lack of
rainfall has severely exacerbated this drought and on January 17, 2014,
California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for
California.
Said Cook, "This solution restores some water deliveries, ensures a
reliable water supply, and saves taxpayer money by eliminating
unnecessary government regulations. It's possible to protect the
environment while ensuring that California farmers and communities have
access to a safe and reliable water supply. This bill restores balance
to California water policy."
A Message from Congressman Cook
A 62-year-old Army veteran from Highland, who was drafted into the Army
in 1971, came into my office looking for assistance obtaining his
retirement after working in Federal Service from 1971-1991. The veteran
applied for his retirement only to find that his service credits were
miscalculated, and therefore the National Guard was not offering him
his retirement. My staff was able to work directly with the Army
National Guard to include documents the veteran provided, recalculate
the credits, and release the veteran's 20-year letter. The veteran
received eligibility for his retirement, which will give him a monthly
benefit for the rest of his life.
My office and I are happy to assist constituents with help on similar
issues. Please contact my Apple Valley District Office with any
questions or concerns at (760) 247-1815.
King of the Hammers
Last Friday, Congressman Cook attended King of the Hammers. There was
an estimated 40,000 attendees at the races, and four-hundred teams
competed during the week. Congressman Cook wants to thank Dave Cole and
numerous supporters that made the King of the Hammers possible.
