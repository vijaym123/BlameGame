Dear Friend,
This week started with a Memorial Day tribute at Lula,
Georgia, and ended with a celebration of the best of our district at
North Georgia Christian School. In between, I traveled Northeast
Georgia's counties to hear from residents, before I return to Washington,
D.C., to make their concerns and ideas my business in Congress.
At
Lula, we honored our country's fallen heroes , who fought and died
protecting our freedom. We vowed to continue their mission --
to lead lives of integrity and respect for America's founding values.
The next day,
I visited Gainesville's Fire and Police
Departments , where Hall County public servants work to ensure our
safety.
In White County, they told me about ways
Congress can help.
Rep.
Collins speaking Lula's Memorial Day event
Recently, I introduced a bill that would allow federal
law enforcement officers to carry their firearms in the event of a
federal funding lapse and another to improve mental health training for
local police. I've voted to lower taxes and regulations. As my friends
at Overdrive Logistics told me on Thursday, the Gainesville trucking
company could hire more employees, if not for federal
interference.
I attended a
Ministers Appreciation Banquet, where we prayed for our friends and
family. And at North Georgia Christian School, my week ended like it
began -- on a patriotic note. Addressing the graduating class, I
emphasized personal responsibility, faith and perseverance, a conservative
message I'll carry with me to Congress, along with all my stories of
hardworking Northeast Georgians.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
