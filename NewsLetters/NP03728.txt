My Best Wishes This Christmas Season
With the holiday season upon us, I wanted to take a brief moment to wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy, hopeful new year!
Weekly Update
Privileged to announce that the President signed my legislation this week to name the Post Office in downtown Jackson after Officer James Bonneau.
While the release of Alan Gross was welcome news, I remain concerned by the Presidents unilateral changes to U.S.-Cuba policy.

Some of you have contacted my office for further details about my vote last week on funding the government.
I appreciate your feedback and have posted additional background on my website, which may be viewed
