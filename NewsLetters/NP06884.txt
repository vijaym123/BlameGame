Last week, I spent some time touring several of the different manufacturing plants we are fortunate to have in the Fourth District. One of the things that struck me, as I met with employees and toured the different facilities, was the stark difference between the way Washington operates and the way these manufacturing plants operate. In Washington, its all about talk. The air is stagnant with clunky bureaucracy and inefficiency. Here at the manufacturing plants in the Fourth District, the air crackles with energy and efficiency. Theres less talk and more action, more building, more creating value.
Below is a roundup of photos, so you can see what I saw during my tour:
Yours in service,
