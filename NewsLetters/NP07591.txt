Dear Friend, This Tea Party Congress is on track to be the least productive in American history.
Its only real competition is the last Tea Party Congress. Right now, the current session of Congress has passed fewer than 200 laws -- and that includes things like naming Post Offices.
I was in the House when the Tea Party took over. I&rsquo;ve seen the damage this group of obstructionists has done, and I am not going to let them do to the Senate what they&rsquo;ve already done to the House.
Support a Congress that actually does its job -- give $5 to help us reach our $35,000 goal for July.

Or donate another amount.
Republicans in the Tea Party suffer from what I call the &ldquo;Republican Paradox.&rdquo;
They don&rsquo;t like government, but they have to run for office to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t work. And if the Tea Party takes over the Senate, we might end up with something worse than the current gridlock. We could see a renewal of the anything-goes financial deregulation that led to the crash of 2008. We could see the end of Medicare as we know it. We could see the privatization of Social Security.
There&rsquo;s only one thing standing between the Tea Party and the six seats they need to pick up to take over the Senate -- and that&rsquo;s you. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford to help us keep fighting and make sure that the Tea Party doesn&rsquo;t pick up a seat in Massachusetts.
I know the do-nothing Congress has been frustrating to watch. Believe me, it&rsquo;s been frustrating to be a part of. But with your help, we can change that -- and we can send the Tea Party packing.
Thanks.
