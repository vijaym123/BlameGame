Dear Friends,
With the New Year underway, priorities are taking shape in Congress. This week, President Barack Obama will deliver his State of the Union address to the nation. You deserve to know the latest out of Washington.
On
Wednesday, January 29th , I will be hosting a community forum in
Bristol at 5:00 p.m.
I hope you will join me for a discussion on the economy and priorities in 2014. Those who attend will have an opportunity to ask questions throughout the forum.
