Friends,
August has officially begun which means I have the
privilege of working in North Carolina and traveling the district to
hear whats on your mind.
The big issues debated by Washingtons
bureaucrats might differ from the issues you discuss with your
coworkers at the office or with your family around the kitchen table.
That is why its so important that I hear from you about your top
concerns, your most pressing needs, and your bright ideas
ideas that
can root out the waste and steer decision-making power back to North
Carolina and away from Washington.
Please take a minute to fill
out the survey below and let me know your
priorities.
Sincerely,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
