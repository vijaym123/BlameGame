WEEK IN REVIEW
Did you do some online shopping
this Cyber Monday? If so, dont forget to file your sales and use
taxes!
The Supreme Courts 1992 Quill decision
which said that
states do not have the authority to compel sellers to collect and remit the
taxes due on purchases if that retailer does not have a physical
presence in the state
has led Americans to believe the Internet is
duty-free.
But in Arkansas and 45 other states, individuals are
responsible for filing these taxes on their own.
Ive introduced
legislation, the Marketplace Fairness Act (MFA; H.R. 684), that allows
but does
not require
states to shift tax-reporting responsibilities to the
retailer.
But until MFA is passed, dont forget to
file!
Arkansans can find more information
here .
And make sure
to get out
this great piece
from the Times
Record!
On Tuesday, in addition
to meeting with Arkansans representing Americans for Energy Alliance, I
attended the lighting of the United States Capitols 2013 Christmas
Tree.
On
Wednesday, I recorded a holiday greeting to our men and women in uniform
serving in over 170 countries.
Thank you for your sacrifices,
and I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year!
In addition to a number of suspensions, on Wednesday, the
House passed
H.R. 1105 ,
the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation
Act .
H.R. 1105 exempts advisers to certain
private equity funds from the new registration requirements established by
the Dodd-Frank Act.
Specifically, H.R. 1105 exempts advisers to
private equity funds that have not borrowed and that do not have
outstanding a principal amount in excess of twice their funded capital
commitments.
On
Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 3309 ,
the Innovation Act .
H.R. 3309 targets abusive patent litigation by increasing
transparency within the litigation process and requiring parties to disclose
more initial information to explain why a suit is being filed.
The
bill also provides for education and outreach to small businesses;
requires studies on abusive patent litigation; and makes improvements
and corrections to the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act
(AIA).
Next week, the House
and Senate are scheduled to return Monday to work on year - end legislative business, which may include a
budget agreement, the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate, and the FARRM
bill.
Until then, as winter storms move across the state, please stay warm and
safe.
