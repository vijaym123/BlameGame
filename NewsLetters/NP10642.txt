Dear
friend,
Nearly every day, the Obama administration announces a new policy or
regulation that undermines our Constitutional rights and stifles our
economy.
The EPA, in particular, has put out some egregious
regulations that have a direct and negative impact on the people of
Idaho.
We saw that recently when, on March 25, the EPA proposed an
aggressive expansion of its regulatory authority over local bodies of
waters and surrounding property.
Under the
Clean Water
Act
(CWA)
which was first passed in 1972
the EPA has authority over
traditionally navigable waters.
While that term was slightly
ambiguous, for decades, the EPA understood there were certain lines it
couldnt cross.
Now, the EPA wants to cross those lines.
Specifically, it wants to remove the word navigable from its
enforcement of the CWA and change how waterways are defined in order to
capture virtually all land in America.
The most obvious effect
of the EPAs plan is that it would increase the number of waters
subject to federal water quality standards, adding costs to Idahos farmers
and small business owners.
But it goes beyond
that.
If the EPAs plan is implemented, their bureaucrats would have
jurisdiction over virtually the whole country.
Basically, if water can
flow on your property, you might find yourself subject to EPA
control.
Virtually every farmer, rancher and homeowner in America might
have to apply for federal permits to do anything on their
land.
To prevent this disaster, I am a cosponsor of
HR
3377 , the
Defense of Environment and Property Act.
This bill would stop the EPA power grab by clarifying existing law
under the
Clean Water Act .
Bureaucrats in
Washington, D.C. should not have regulatory power over puddles, ditches,
and other water sources that have no connection to interstate
commerce.
Its time for the EPA needs to be reined in.
I am
committed to protecting Idahos property owners and imposing common sense on
an agency that desperately needs it.
