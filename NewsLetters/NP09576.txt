House Passes Bills to Help Combat Human Trafficking
Today, the House of Representatives approved several bipartisan bills to combat the growing
problem of human trafficking.
Most people think that human trafficking only happens in other countries, but this crime is
not confined to brothels in Bangkok or Eastern Europe. It can happen anywhere, and it&rsquo;s happening right here in America every single day.
The approval of these anti-human
trafficking bills in the House of Representatives ensures that we have the tools needed to hold perpetrators who sell, buy, or market children to
potential buyers accountable for their heinous crimes. Three of these bills, the
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
(H.R. 3530), the
Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act
(H.R. 3610), and the
Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act
(H.R. 4225), were
approved by the
House Judiciary Committee
late last month. These bills also ensure that exploited children are treated as victims rather than as criminals and provide much-needed
resources to victims of sex trafficking that will help them reclaim and rebuild their lives. I support efforts to end these horrific crimes, and I
urge the Senate to take up these crucial bills without delay.
Together , we can make significant progress towards ending
human trafficking.

FAST FACTS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING
It is estimated that child sex trafficking in the U.S. is a $9.8 billion industry.
It's estimated that over 290,000
American youth are at risk of becoming a victim of sex trafficking.
From 2004 through 2008, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force experienced an increase of more than
900 percent in the number of minor sex trafficking complaints.
According to the FBI, sex trafficking is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal
enterprise in the world.
