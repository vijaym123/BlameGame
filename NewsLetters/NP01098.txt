Greetings,
Among the privileges of serving as your representative in Congress is the opportunity to meet and work with young people all across South Central Kansas.
Last week I hosted a reception for high school artists from across the district who competed in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.
It was a remarkable day and the talent demonstrated by all who participated was truly top-notch.
Each piece highlighted the unique artistic ability of Fourth District Kansas students.
You can see all of the art
here .
The
Congressional Institute
permits members of Congress to voluntarily host a competition to honor the artistic talents of high school students in their district.
The winner of the competition and a guest are treated to a trip to Washington, D.C. for an awards ceremony.
There they will join the other competition winners who will all have their artwork hung in the U.S. Capitol for an entire year.
We had a record number of entries this year
68 students from 15 high schools submitted 126 pieces of art!
Susan and I, along with members from our Advisory Board, celebrated the talents of the students who submitted artwork, gave honorable mention awards to nine students, and named the top three winners.
The competition was tough with very high-quality works submitted.
I want to thank each of the members of our community that gave freely of their time to provide an impartial, juried experience to these talented young people.

Whether this is their creative outlet for fun or it is the students' intent to make the arts their vocation, these young artists give promise to the quality of the artwork that will come from Kansas in the future.
I want to congratulate each of the winners, and thank all of the entrants in this years competition.
Finally, I want to give a special thank you to Mike Michaelis and Emprise Bank.
They have been such great friends of the arts here in Kansas and have supported my effort to expand the world of young Kansas artists every year weve held these competitions.
Mike has provided the financial support that permits this program to be such a continued success.
Thanks Mike.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
