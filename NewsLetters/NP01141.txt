As part of a larger effort to improve government transparency and keep the constituents of Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District informed of current legislative business, I send out weekly updates at the beginning of each Session week. These updates are a brief overview of legislative matters to be addressed each week. Please click on my photo below to listen to the audio clip.
As always, if you have questions or concerns on any issue or need help with a federal agency, please contact our offices anytime.
