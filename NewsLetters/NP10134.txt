Dear
F riends,
Since 2009, my office has helped more than 1,700 residents deal with pending foreclosures of their homes. Since 2011, nearly 1,000 homeowners in the Fourth District have been approved for HomeSafe Georgia &#8211; which helps homeowners who are
unemployed or underemployed through no fault of their own with up to 24 months of mortgage payments. It&#8217;s resulted in nearly $20 million in relief, more than any other congressional district in Georgia.
I bring this to your attention because there are now more ways to qualify for HomeSafe. Not only has the assistance expanded from 18 to 24 months, but homeowners who have suffered a medical hardship, a death in the family or a military
hardship can now qualify for assistance.
I&#8217;m proud of our office&#8217;s work with the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA)
&#8211;
which runs HomeSafe GA
&#8211;
to get the word out about the program and help get DCA&#8217;s Fourth District outreach off the ground. For more on HomeSafe GA qualifications and how it might help you, a family member or your neighbor, click
HERE . To apply online, click
