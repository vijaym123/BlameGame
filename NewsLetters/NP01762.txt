Dear Friends,
I was on
the short end of a 392-37 vote last week on a budget-busting Medicare
bill that adds at least
$141 billion to our deficit. Casting my
no vote on H.R. 2 should have been easy. Its consistent with one of
the most important promises Ive made to Idahoans: to fight at every
turn to reduce our $18.1 trillion federal debt.
But tucked
into this massive Medicare spending bill is an unrelated provision
extending funding for the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program. Passed as a
stop-gap to replace lost revenue from declining timber harvests on
federal lands, SRS provides support to local government and schools in 35
Idaho counties. Rural counties are especially dependent on these
funds.
I have long advocated a lasting replacement for SRS. We
must reopen our federal forests to job-creating private-sector
investment and empower rural communities to generate revenue from
underutilized lands. In fact, I would have supported extending SRS funding in a
stand-alone bill, or as part of relevant natural resources legislation.
But attaching two years of SRS funding to a completely unrelated
Medicare spending bill was unacceptable to me.
Why? Because I
still believe the debt is the greatest threat to our national security
and the future of our nation. As Republicans, we promised the American
people that we would do everything in our power to battle this debt
crisis.
The timing of the March 26 vote to add more debt is
unsettling. On March 25, a GOP budget passed with promises to balance
the budget in 10 years. Republican fiscal restraint lasted a single
day.
The
Congressional Budget Office
estimates
that H.R. 2 will increase federal deficits by $141 billion from
2015-2025. CBO says a precise estimate is not feasible for
2025-2035, but says the bill would raise federal costs over current
law.
In addition, the bipartisan
Committee for a
Responsible Budget did issue an estimate
for 2015-2035, saying the bill
would add $500 billion to the debt.
Maya MacGuineas,
president of CRFB, spoke in Idaho in 2012. She warned of the fiscal cliff
facing America and called for bipartisan solutions that threaten
future generations.
In announcing her groups opposition to H.R.
2 last week, MacGuineas said, When we call for bipartisanship, this
isnt what we mean. Its easy to be bipartisan when adding to the
debt. The parties need to come together to improve our unsustainable
fiscal situation, not to worsen it.
I wont forget my promise
to restore fiscal sanity. Continuing to kick the can down the road is
irresponsible, wrong-headed and immoral. I simply wont do
it.
Thank
you ,
