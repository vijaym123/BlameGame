The Scalise Capitol Report
Calling for an immediate travel ban to prevent the spread of Ebola
Last week the House called on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Director Thomas Frieden to testify before Congress about the course of action his agency has taken to protect the American people. We didnt get many answers, which is just
one of the many reasons Americans are losing confidence in this president and this Administration.
The CDC has received a 200 percent increase in their budget since 2000, yet has not been able to properly respond to this crisis. After speaking to medical professionals and listening to my constituents, last week I called on President Obama to
issue an immediate travel ban
from the impacted Western African countries until such time that he can ensure no more people who have contracted this dangerous disease will come into the United States.

Protecting the jobs of disabled workers from being shipped overseas
I am outraged by the Obama Administration's decision to
lay off disabled American workers
in favor of sending their jobs overseas with little explanation or transparency. For over 75 years, AbilityOne agencies, such as Lighthouse for the Blind, have helped to support our troops and provide meaningful jobs and income to individuals who are legally blind or have severe disabilities. But due to a policy change by the Obama Administration, the jobs provided by Lighthouse for the Blind and other organizations like them have been shipped overseas.
In this letter , I called on the Obama Administration to reverse this ill-advised policy and bring those jobs back to America.
Meeting our nations maritime needs
I was honored to be a part of the recent christening of Blessey Marine's vessel Clark Todd in New Orleans, which is one of the 40,000 vessels working in the US maritime industry. This vessel serves as a powerful reminder of the positive economic impact the maritime industry as a whole has on our local and national economy. According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers earlier this year, Louisianas maritime industry alone contributes more than $11 billion in total economic output and supports 54,850 jobs. In fact, one in every 83 jobs in Louisiana is connected to the maritime industry and Im proud our State leads the nation in domestic maritime employment. In order to strengthen our economy, I will continue fighting for policies that keep Americas maritime industry strong and thriving.
Special events in Louisiana
I met with some community leaders in Southeast Louisiana at the Metairie Womans Club's Christmas in October event last week. What a great group. We discussed the policies Im fighting for to strengthen our economy, put hardworking Louisiana taxpayers back to work, and ensure a better quality of life for our nations heroes. In addition to attending so many other events throughout the district last week, it was really special to go to St. Dominic's class of 1954 reunion in honor of my late mother Carol's graduating class.
