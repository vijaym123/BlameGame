David -- I'll be frank:
I'm fighting every day to move our country forward, but Republicans in Congress have blocked me every step of the way.
They've voted to repeal health care. They've blocked my executive nominations. They've even threatened to impeach me.
So David, I'm asking for a quick favor:
In 24 hours, we face a crucial fundraising deadline. I need your help to hold House Republicans accountable for their obstructionist tactics.
We need 97 more people from Illinois. Will you chip in $5? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thank you,
Barack Obama
