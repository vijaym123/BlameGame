That annual day of dread is looming: Tax Day.
Each year it becomes
more difficult to figure and pay taxes as the U.S. tax code grows
longer and much more convoluted.
Studies have shown such a
complicated tax code costs Americans $160 billion and 6 billion hours every
year.
The complexity of the U.S. tax code is nonsense and
only hinders our full potential.
There are solutions to this
self-affliction.
Recently, the House passed its Fiscal Year 2016
budget resolution, setting a framework for a much simpler tax code.
The budget balances in nine years without increasing taxes, and calls
for the repeal of Obamacare, which in itself is a $2 trillion
tax.
Another remedy would be the Fair Tax, which continues to be a
measure I strongly support.
The Fair Tax would repeal income,
corporate, employment and estate taxes and impose a consumption tax on
most goods and services.
Even better, it terminates funding for
the Internal Revenue Service.
It also would stop all tax cheats
and underground off the books businesses from avoiding paying their
fair share as we all must. Americans work hard for what they make.
Keeping more of what is earned, rather than it being taken,
incentivizes work and boosts the economy.
The Fair Tax addresses this
common sense notion.
All in all, the tax code is more than 4
million words long, or more than seven times the length of J.R.R.
Tolkiens
Lord of the Rings
novel series and is not near as
interesting.
Closing loopholes, which are inefficient and costly, and
simplifying the code to lessen the burden on all Americans would all
make for an easier read.
It is past time to move forward with a
truly simple, fair and more uniform tax code to better the American
economy and strengthen the nation.
I am hopeful we will soon take
strides to put these ideas to work and make April 15 just another day
on the calendar.
