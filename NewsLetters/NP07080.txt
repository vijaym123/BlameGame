Policy Update: The
VA Scandal
Americans are empowered when their government works for
not against
them.
But as you know, the federal government has faced quite a
few scandals as of late, including the IRS targeting scandal, the
attack in Benghazi, and the VA scandal.
In this weeks policy update,
I will discuss the VA scandal and what Congress has done in response
to the revelation that some within the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) hid waiting lists of patients from official
records.
Earlier this year, news broke that veterans
who had bravely served our country were suffering and even dying
because they had been kept on secret waiting lists for extreme periods of
time to receive care at VA health care facilities.
This was done
to make it look as if these facilities were performing at a higher
level with shorter wait times, so that the employees could receive
performance bonuses in some instances.
The root of the problem was a disconnect between those
performing care and the leadership of the department
oftentimes coming
from VA supervisors themselves.
These supervisors were instructing
their subordinates to hide information, so that reports to their own
superiors would be more favorably received.
Furthermore,
oftentimes when the employees spoke out, the supervisors meted out
retribution.
Finally, a few brave whistleblowers came forward to express
their concerns.
Rewarding VA
employees for delaying and denying care for tens of thousands of our
veterans is indefensible
our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than the
one we owe them, and these reports highlight minimally a breach of
competence and, perhaps, criminal activity within the VA.
We need
the truth, and I commend my colleagues on the House Veterans Affairs
Committee for their dedication to getting to the bottom of this as soon
as possible.
After some investigation, the House and Senate
began developing a plan of accountability to address the needs of our
veterans.
The goals for the
proposal were to get veterans the care they need when they need it and to
make it possible to remove those bad actors within the VA.
There
were those who argued for veterans to have a greater ability to have
their VA benefits cover private care.
Still others wanted more
funding to go to the VA, so that they could expand rapidly the facilities
and personnel needed for timely care.
A mix of these two
options made it into the agreement between Veterans Affairs Committee
Chairmen Bernie Sanders (Senate) and Jeff Miller (House), and Congress
passed the legislation in the last week of session before the August
district work period.
The final
legislative compromise, the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability
Act of 2014, was signed into law on August 7, 2014, by President
Obama.
The law addresses the problems at the VA by allowing veterans to
leverage private care to fulfill their health needs, holds high-level
employees in the VA accountable for underperformance or corruption,
increases congressional oversight through the Congressional Commission
on Care, and provides for the hiring of additional medical staff
within the VA to increase its ability to care for veterans.
I am
hopeful this will jumpstart the efforts to get the VA back on
track.
I am also hopeful that
newly-confirmed Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald will undertake
steps to turn around the embattled department from within.
In his
previous posts, he was known as an innovative thinker, and I am
confident he will produce results to deliver quality and timely care to our
veterans.
While this legislation
and new leadership address problems at the VA on a national level, I
know that individual veterans need assistance resolving a problem
within the VA from time to time.
Should this apply to you or someone
you know, please reach out to one of my district offices in Rogers
(479-464-0446), Fort Smith (479-424-1146), or Harrison (870-741-6900) so
we can do our best to help.
We
owe the greatest amount of respect and gratitude to our veterans for
their selfless service to our nation
this starts with ensuring they
can access the timely and quality care they have earned.
I will
continue to work with my colleagues to address the systemic issues at
the VA and change its culture to fulfill our promise to our
veterans.
From the
Front...
Congressman Steve
Womack
Arkansas Third District
There are many challenges facing our
nation; challenges that must be addressed sooner rather than later.
House Republicans are working every day to advance real solutions to
these challenges. In August and September, I will be hosting town halls
across the Third District, so I can hear what's most important to you
and bring that message back with me to Washington. Armed with your
feedback and ideas, we will continue to fight for the American people by
passing thoughtful, innovative, and commonsense solutions to that lead
to greater freedom and opportunity for you. I hope you will take a
moment to take this quick survey, so I can be sure to talk about the
issues you feel are most pressing.
Of all the challenges facing America, it is most important
for the President - and Congress - focus on Creating jobs and building a healthy
economy Reducing spending and
the size of government Cutting bureaucratic red tape and decreasing the burden of
regulations Dealing with the
Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Reforming our broken immigration system and addressing the crisis
on our southern border Increasing domestic energy exploration and development Holding the government and the
Obama administration accountable for recent scandals, including the VA,
Benghazi, and the IRS Protecting Americans at home and abroad Fighting climate change Other If you answered other, feel free to elaborate
