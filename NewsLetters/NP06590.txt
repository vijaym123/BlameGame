Dear Friend,
We have 8 hours left until midnight, and I know that our grassroots team is going to find a way to raise the last $1,575 we need to hit our $50,000 goal before tonight&rsquo;s deadline. Your contribution could be the one that puts us over the top. Can you give $5, $10, even $20 to help us reach our primary goal before midnight?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
We&rsquo;re almost there. I know it might feel like a long way between now and November, but these next few weeks are going to fly by.
I can see it in the faces of my campaign team as they reach for another cup of coffee. They&rsquo;ve already put in so much work. They&rsquo;ve built the infrastructure we need to win. Now all we need is a grassroots push down the home stretch. That starts with you -- give $5 before midnight and help us hit our $50,000 goal.
We&rsquo;re almost there. And when we&rsquo;re celebrating on November 4, it will be thanks to all the hard work you&rsquo;ve put in.
Thanks,
Ed
