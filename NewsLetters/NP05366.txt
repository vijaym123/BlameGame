Stopping Ebola
Dear
Friends:
With the third
confirmed case of Ebola in Dallas, Americans are justifiably
concerned.
There is currently no cure for this deadly virus, so we as a
nation must take action to prevent its further
spread.
Accordingly on October
8 th , I, along with 26 of my colleagues in the House of
Representatives, sent a bipartisan letter to the President asking him to act to
prevent the continued threat of Ebola by restricting travel to the United
States by people coming from countries with known outbreaks.
The
letter also asks for better screening processes at major airports
within the United States to prevent further incidents of infected people
entering the country.
Shortly after we sent this letter,
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced enhanced screening
procedures at the five major airports (New Yorks JFK,
Washington-Dulles, Newark, Chicagos OHare, and Atlanta) that receive over 94% of
travelers from the affected countries in West
Africa.
As for the resources needed to
fight this outbreak, the House and Senate have already done their part
and on September 19, 2014, the President signed House Joint
Resolution 124 into law.
The legislation allocates $58 million to the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the acceleration
of research and development into potential vaccinations for
Ebola.
It also provides an additional $30 million for expenses necessary
to support the responses of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to the outbreak of the Ebola virus. This total of $88 million to
combat the Ebola outbreak is the amount that the President requested,
so regardless of what you may have heard, Congress has fully funded
efforts to find a vaccine and treat those who it infects.
I
voted in favor of this legislation when it passed the House of
Representatives.
The
Administration is also employing the Department of Defense (DoD) in
the fight against Ebola. The President has announced that he will deploy
over 3,000 troops to West Africa in response to the Ebola outbreak.
The DoD has stated that its personnel will not provide direct medical
care to Ebola victims, but will build treatment centers and provide
logistical and technical support.
Nonetheless, I am deeply
opposed to this use of our military because the DoD is not a development
agency and treating victims of a contagious disease is not something
most of the soldiers deploying are trained to do. I realize that the
deploying soldiers will receive extensive training, but as the infection
of the two nurses, at the Texas hospital where Thomas Eric Duncan was
treated demonstrates, even highly trained professionals are
susceptible.
So, if the President, as commander-in-chief, is determined
to take this step, he must take great care in how it is executed.
Personally, as a Marine Corps combat veteran and Member of the House
Armed Services Committee, I consider the health and safety of our
troops a top priority and I hope the President does,
too.
Congress has done its
job providing the resources to fight Ebola.
Now its time for the
President to do his.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S. Representative

Lawmakers backing travel
ban
By: The
Hill Staff
The Hill
Published October 16, 2014
P ressure is building on President Obama to ban flights to West
African nations that are battling Ebola, as concerns mount about the
disease spreading in the United States.
Administration
officials have resisted a flight ban thus far, arguing it would make it
harder to deliver relief supplies to the countries where the virus is
running rampant.
But
lawmakers, in growing numbers, are pushing Obama to reverse course, and
polls show the idea has strong public support.
Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) says a flight ban is
something the president should consider, adding that he already has
the authority he would need to put such restrictions in
place.
The president has the authority to take this action right
now. The House will continue to conduct rigorous oversight, which,
along with discussions with our members, will help inform our path forward
as we continue to assess the administrations response, Boehner
spokesman Kevin Smith said.
Heres a look at where lawmakers
stand on the travel ban.

LAWMAKERS AGAINST TRAVEL
BAN
House
(13 total, all Democrats)
Rep. Eddie
Bernice Johnson (D-Texas)
Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas)
Cuellar said he's "pleased"

necessary.
Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.)
Ellison
tweeted
Thursday
that a travel ban would be a "bad idea" because it "stops health care

he supports "the work the administration is doing right now" to rein in
the disease.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas)
Jackson Lee said U.S. officials should focus their efforts on
enhanced health screenings.
Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah)

all."
Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.)
Moore said a travel ban
will only exacerbate the epidemic.
Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.)
Sarbanes said Thursday,
"[A]t this point, I'm going to follow the guidance that's being
provided by the experts and by the
scientists."
Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.)
Schakowsky
said Thursday, "[W]e can eliminate flights, but I don't think we can
eliminate people from coming here. ... Do we really want to
essentially quarantine West Africa so that people have a hard time coming or
going? ... We cannot build a wall around the United
States."
Rep. Marc Veasey
(D-Texas)
Rep. Henry Waxman
(D-Calif.)
Waxman said Thursday, "[The ban] doesn't make sense
because that's not the biggest problem we need to deal with, keeping people
from traveling. We've got to stop the epidemic [by taking steps] to
identify the people with Ebola, isolate them, find the people who have
been exposed to them, and track them very carefully, whether that's in
Africa or in the United States."
Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.)
Welch said Thursday, "Congress
is now apparently made up of 435 doctors. We ought to be taking the
advice of the medical community. ... And the medical community
including Doctors Without Borders
are much more in favor of restrictions
and monitoring as being more effective than a ban, which has
psychological appeal but, by experience, doesn't work as
well."
Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.)
Yarmuth
said Thursday, "I'm not quite sure I'm there yet. I understand the
rationale from the administration for opposing it. I think I'd like to
get a little bit more information."

Coffman urges
President to take concrete steps on Ebola
outbreak

Published October 16,
2014
( Washington, D.C.)
Congressman
Mike Coffman
and a bipartisan group of lawmakers
have called on the Obama administration to take concrete steps to
address the Ebola outbreak.
Last week, the lawmakers sent a
letter
to the President,
suggesting additional steps that include increased screening for people
arriving from affected West African nations, possible quarantines
during the dormancy period for individuals who have been to affected areas,
and a travel ban from affected West African countries until the
epidemic has been
defeated.
Denver VA Medical Center says operating rooms open
for surgeries after contamination issues
By:
Russell Haythorn

Posted:

2014
DENVER - After staff
members told 7NEWS the surgical unit at Denver's Veterans Affairs
Medical Center would be closed again this week due to contamination
issues, VAMC Public Information Officer Dan Warvi, provided an
update, saying the hospital's operating rooms are open for limited
procedures, and that disposable surgical tools would be
used.
Warvi released the
following statement to
7NEWS:
"We have been performing surgical
procedures with disposable instrumentation, and now have completed enough
resurfacing and sterilization processes to resume doing procedures with our
stainless steel instrumentation.
We have surgeries
scheduled for tomorrow and the remainder of the week. I would ask that you
emphasize on-air and on your web page that any Veteran who has a surgical
procedure scheduled for tomorrow should go to the Denver
VA."
Last
month, the hospital revealed that " trace mineral
deposits " on surgical equipment forced the hospital's seven operating
rooms within its surgical unit to partially
close.
Concerned veterans say the issue could
have grave consequences for patients such as Daniel King, who suffers
from papillary thyroid cancer.
"And if (I) don't get surgery soon, I'm going to be
inoperable - Stage 4," said King, a U.S. Army veteran. "I signed up for
Vietnam when people didn't say, 'Thank you for your service.' They
spit on us and called us 'baby killers' and every name in the book when
we had to go through the airport in uniform. It's a whole different
culture now. But, we're still being spit on by the
government."
King called the VA issues
a "culture of slackerism."
Monday, Colorado Republican Congressman
Mike
Coffman , also criticized the culture of big bonuses and no
accountability within the VA.
"Where everybody gets a bonus," said Coffman. "Where nobody's
ever fired. Where nobody's ever disciplined. Where we do have patient
safety problems. We still have a long way to go, to be able to fix this
broken system."
Coffman vowed reform is coming from Washington, including a choice
option for patients waiting too long to be
seen.
"So they can go outside the VA system,
their choice, and have that choice provider reimbursed under the
Medicare rates for whatever services they receive," said
Coffman.
King hopes it isn't too
little, too late.
"There are literally thousands of veterans that are going without
surgery that need it," he said. "Lately it just seems to be coming
unglued."
