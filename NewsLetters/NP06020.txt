&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been waiting until after Labor Day to start taking the cycle seriously, time&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;

Dear Friend,
Polls across the country are tightening, but Huffington Post&rsquo;s model still gives the GOP a 56% chance of capturing the Senate.
Steve Benen&rsquo;s right -- it&rsquo;s past time to get serious about this year&rsquo;s elections. We have 41 days until November 4th, and we need to make every second count. We&rsquo;re less than a week away from our FEC deadline, and we need to hit our $145,000 goal to stay on track for victory. Pitch in with a $5 contribution.

Or donate another amount.
A full-blown Tea Party Congress is just six Senate seats away. We may not be able to control what happens in other races, but we can certainly control our own destiny here in Massachusetts.
I know that many of you have been working on this race for months now. I know it&rsquo;s tiring, and I know you&rsquo;re getting tired of these emails -- believe me, I&rsquo;d love to not have to send them. But with so much at stake, we can&rsquo;t take anything for granted, even in a traditionally blue state like Massachusetts. Help us hit our goal before the FEC deadline on the 30th -- make a $5 contribution right now.
Thank you for reading these emails, and thank you for taking this year&rsquo;s elections seriously. It will be up to us to make sure our friends and neighbors are doing the same.
Sincerely,
Ed
