The Rigell Report: Honoring Our Veterans
( Congressman Rigell thanks WWII veterans participating in the Honor Flight program)
Dear Friend,
Our 35th President John F. Kennedy once said, "As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them." While we pause every year on this day to honor and extend our heartfelt appreciation to our veterans and their families for their service to our great country, we must be ever mindful of the generations of heavy sacrifice paid so that the blessings of liberty and freedom may endure.
It is an incredible honor to serve the Second Congressional District of Virginia because I am mindful of the special contribution our region has made in defense of our country. From the piers of Norfolk have sailed thousands of Sailors, Marines, and Soldiers to places across the globe in defense of liberty. From the airfields in Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Hampton our pilots have taken to the skies in defense of freedom. On those same piers and airfields, tears of joy have been shed as families have been reunited with their husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters coming home from war.
I do not know why Providence calls upon some to give so much and others their last breath in defense of our freedom
but I do know with certainty that we owe these brave men and women our complete commitment to care for their families. Those who have lost a loved one in this fight for freedom - our Gold Star families - have our eternal gratitude and respect.
I am deeply grateful for each of our nations veterans
theyve truly met their duty to our country. Their mission was accomplished and they stand before an eternally grateful nation.
As we thank our heroes in our district today, I would like to particularly thank my father, Ike Rigell, an Iwo Jima Marine, who has taught me the importance of honor, courage, and commitment.
May God continue to bless our veterans, their families, and the United States of America.
Mindful that I work for you, I remain
Yours in Freedom,
Scott Rigell
