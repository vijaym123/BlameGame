This week, Congressman Peter King (R-NY) and I introduced the Sensible Accounting to Value Energy (SAVE) Act, which establishes more accurate mortgage underwriting and appraisals, encouraging investments in energy efficient homebuilding.
Independent analysts predict this bipartisan legislation will create 83,000 construction jobs and will save consumers $1.1 billion in energy bills by 2020. This bill allows mortgage agencies to take into consideration a home&rsquo;s energy efficiency and expected monthly energy bills when determining a homeowner&rsquo;s ability to pay monthly mortgage payments.
It will also improve appraisal values for energy efficient homes, incentivizing homeowners to invest in energy efficiencies and lowering utility bills for American households in the long-term.
In today&rsquo;s real estate market it is easy for a homeowner to recoup the costs of aesthetic renovations such as granite countertops and wood flooring &ndash; the SAVE Act makes it easier for homeowners to recoup investments in energy efficiency improvements.
This is the companion bill to S. 1106, Sen. Michael Bennet's bipartisan Senate bill. Because of the bipartisan and broad support, I hope House and Senate leaders will quickly allow us to pass this important proposal.
Colorado STEM focus fuels House App Competition
Ed talks mobile technology with Northglenn students
Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) are crucial to the 21st-century economy, and schools around Colorado are quickly adopting policies to better introduce these subjects to students eager to learn about innovation how jobs and the economy will look in the future.
On Saturday, teams competed in my first ever House App contest. High School students throughout the 7th district developed apps for mobile devices, and then presented them at Northglenn High School to a panel of expert judges. The winning app, from the Northglenn High School team, was designed to keep students more connected with their school by incorporating and updating calendar, assignments page, and school wide notifications alert. Congratulations to all the talented students who participated!

Thank you, teachers!
Ed thanks teachers on the House floor
This week we recognized Teacher Appreciation Week. To all teachers, thank you for all you do. I am fortunate to have learned from many amazing educators, from my time in the Jefferson County public schools through graduation at the University of Colorado. My wife, Nancy, and my sister, Cassie, are both teachers, and they continue to inspire me.
This week, I thanked teachers on the floor of U.S. House of Representatives.
