David, you&rsquo;re reading this, so you know we&rsquo;ve been emailing
non-stop
this month.
Why? Because Cheri&rsquo;s running in one of the
toughest
races in the entire country.
And while our opponent has Boehner and the Kochs in his corner, we&rsquo;ve got grassroots supporters like you, David. A whole lot of you in fact -- 7,433 donations just this year alone!
BUT -- we can&rsquo;t rest on our laurels. Not even for a second.
Illinois, let&rsquo;s make history. Pitch in before midnight and help us reach 7,5OO donations for Cheri.
