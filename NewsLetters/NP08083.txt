Rep. Levin Introduces Bill to Prevent Loss of
700,000 Highway Jobs
The federal Highway Trust Fund is nearing the end of the
road.
The fund, which supports highway construction and maintenance,
will be exhausted later this summer.
Unless Congress acts soon,
112,000 roadway projects and 5600 transit projects could be brought to
a halt, and as many as 700,000 construction jobs could be put at
risk.
Reps. Levin and Van
Hollen (D-Maryland) have introduced a bill to solve this problem by
closing an abusive loophole in the tax code.
Their bill [ H.R. 4985 ] would shore up the Highway Trust Fund by
putting an end to so-called corporate tax inversions.
Through these
maneuvers, U.S. companies reincorporate as foreign companies for
tax purposes.
These corporate expatriations cost other taxpayers
billions of dollars.
By tightening restrictions on corporate
inversions, H.R. 4985 raises $19.5 billion over ten years and uses the
money to address the immediate shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund,
keeping American workers on the job rebuilding and repairing our
infrastructure.

House Lawmakers Divided on Military Operations in
Iraq
Recent events in Iraq
have many Americans concerned.
A violent extremist group called
ISIL has quickly seized large amounts of territory within Iraq with very
little resistance from the Iraqi army.
The situation in Iraq is
complicated.
Iraqs Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has
governed Iraq in a sectarian manner for years, refusing to share political
power and failing to promote reconciliation with Sunnis and other groups
within Iraq.
President Obama has sent 300 non-combat military
advisors to Iraq to assess the situation on the ground, but the
President has indicated that U.S. troops will not return to combat operations
in Iraq.
On June 29,
the House of Representatives debated the annual funding bill for the
Department of Defense.
Many House members feel that further U.S.
military involvement in Iraq would be unlikely to succeed and that
only Iraqs leaders can unify their nation.
Rep. Barbara Lee of
California offered an amendment to the defense bill that would bar the
use of funds in 2015 for any combat operations in Iraq.
The
amendment failed on a vote of 163 to 249.
Rep. Levin voted for the
Lee amendment.
Rep. Levin Urges Greater Protections for Captive
Marine Mammals
In May 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposed to
update captive marine mammal standards for indoor facilities, outdoor
facilities, water quality, space requirements, and swim-with-the-dolphin
programs.
During the comment period, USDA received numerous
comments recommending changes to tank sizes and otherwise improving
facilities for marine mammals. Yet 12 years after the public comment closed,
USDA still has not completed the rulemaking.
On May 29, forty
members of the House of Representatives, including Rep. Levin, wrote a
letter
to the Secretary of Agriculture to urge
him to take immediate steps to immediately update Animal Welfare Act
protections for captive marine mammals.
