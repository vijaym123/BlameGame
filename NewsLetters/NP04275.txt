The First Amendment guarantees that we have freedom to live our lives according to our religious beliefs and moral convictions, free from government coercion. An individual does not abandon this freedom simply because he enters the military.
Faith, and the ability of individuals to exercise their religious beliefs, has been vital to the men and women who have served on behalf of this nation for generations.
Its what got them through war.
Its what kept them going when they wanted to give up.
Its something that bonded them with each other.
Last week, the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel held a hearing on religious accommodation in the Armed Services.

to watch the hearing as well as my questioning. Just because you wear a uniform, doesnt mean you can no longer express your faith.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Servicemembers should not be forced to leave their faith at home when they volunteer to serve.
As Founder and Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, I will continue working to protect and preserve religious freedom for those in the military and for all Americans.
