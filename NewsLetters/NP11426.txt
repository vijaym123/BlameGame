Lummis Fights for Wyoming Volunteer Firefighters
Dear Friends,
Most of our communities in Wyoming do not have the resources to support a full-time, paid fire department.
That is why we depend heavily on the willingness of Wyomings volunteer firefighters and other volunteer first responders.
Their work contributes immensely to the safety of our communities and their sacrifice is an inspiration to Wyoming.
Since they do not have the resources to fulfill Obamacares heavy-handed mandates, these volunteer departments were threatened with closure.
These first responders and their volunteer work, which contributes so much to the safety of our communities, deserve our thanks and support.
I am pleased we passed H.R. 3979: the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act of 2014 to protect these volunteer emergency responders from having to shut their doors because of Obamacare.
As I continue to work for Wyomings interests in Washington and fight the ramifications of Obamacare and for its full repeal, feel free to
contact me
with any thoughts or concerns.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

and
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
