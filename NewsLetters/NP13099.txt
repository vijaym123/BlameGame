Jan 17, 2014
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) today made the following statement upon her appointment to the
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure&#8217;s Public-Private Partnerships Special Panel.
The Committee&#8217;s Public-Private Partnerships Special Panel will focus on the use of and opportunities for public-private partnerships (P3s) across all modes of
transportation, economic development, public buildings, water, and maritime infrastructure and equipment.
Miller has served on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure since 2007 and is the only member from Michigan on the committee.
&#8220;Our nation is faced with numerous infrastructure maintenance, modernization and new construction needs &#8211; all which require investments to be made.
Through the use public-private partnerships, there is a tremendous avenue for our nation to move needed infrastructure
projects forward in a significant and responsible way.
Michigan has put a focus on developing these types of partnerships which only help support underserved projects within our communities and enable them to both thrive economically and improve quality of
life,&#8221; Miller said.
&#8220;As the only Michigan member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee this will be an interesting challenge, and I look forward to the panel&#8217;s work focusing on the positives ways these types of partnerships will lessen the reliance
on federal government assistance and create a network of public and private resources aimed at moving important projects forward.&#8221;
Miller will be joined on the panel with the following members: Representatives John J. Duncan, Jr. (TN-2) - Panel Chairman,
Lou Barletta (PA-11), Tom Rice (SC-7), Mark Meadows (NC-11), Scott Perry (PA-4), Michael Capuano (MA-7) - Ranking Member, Peter A. DeFazio (OR-4), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC), Rick Larsen (WA-2) and Sean Patrick Maloney (NY18).
The panel will examine the current state of P3s in the United States to identify: (1) the role P3s play in development
and delivery of transportation and infrastructure projects in the U.S., and on the U.S. economy; (2) if/how P3s enhance delivery and management of transportation and infrastructure projects beyond the capabilities of government agencies or the private sector
acting independently; and (3) how to balance the needs of the public and private sectors when considering, developing, and implementing P3 projects.
This week, the Transportation Committee held its first hearing on the next reauthorization of surface transportation programs,
which it plans to develop this year.
The P3 panel&#8217;s work can serve as another tool the Committee uses to write that legislation, as well as other initiatives to improve the United States&#8217; ability to utilize available resources and strengthen our infrastructure.
