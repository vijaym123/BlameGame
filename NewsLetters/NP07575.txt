Standing Strong Against
Terrorism
It was a busy but rewarding week on Capitol
Hill. Two different bills I introduced passed the House without a single
'nay' vote. On Tuesday evening, the House passed the Hezbollah
International Financing Prevention Act of 2014 by a vote of 404-0, which
will place harsh sanctions on the terrorist organization Hezbollah. The
U.S. must take a strong stand against Hezbollah, a dangerous terrorist
organization that is responsible for the second largest number of
American deaths overseas just after al
Qaeda.
Hezbollah's terrorist activities aren't confined within the borders
of Iran and Lebanon, but span globally--even into the U.S.. It wasn't
very long ago that a Hezbollah terrorist cell was
found operating
in Charlotte, NC. Recent reports suggest this
organization is considering joining Hamas in the fight against Israel. Now,
more than ever, this legislation must be signed into
law.

floor speech urging support for the bill

Fighting to End Human
Trafficking
On Wednesday, my bill combating human trafficking passed the
House unanimously. The Human Trafficking Detection Act,
H.R. 5116 , requires the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) to provide training for employees who monitor travelers across
U.S. borders and through airports, on the best methods of detecting
potential trafficking victims. Human trafficking doesn't just take
place in the developing world, but right here on American soil. The U.S.
State Department estimates as many as 17,500 people--half of which are
children-- are trafficked through our nation annually. Human
trafficking is one of the great injustices of our time. We must do all that we
can to stop modern day slavery. You can read more about the bill
here .

Preventing Another IRS Email
Scandal
Oversight and Government Reform
Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and I introduced a bill that will
prevent a repeat of the IRS email scandal by beefing up federal
record-keeping laws. The American people are sick and tired of federal
employees picking and choosing when to follow federal law. Former IRS
official Lois Lerner wasn't only in violation of the law when she targeted
Tea Party groups, but also when she failed to properly archive her
official communications under the Federal Records Act. This bill will
ensure federal employees comply with the law. It's time for some
accountability. Read more about the bill in the
Washington Times
