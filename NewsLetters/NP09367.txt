Dear Friend,
Memorial
Day is an occasion to pay tribute and offer thanks to the men and
women in uniform who have sacrificed their lives for our country. The debt
owed to them and to their families can never be repaid.
As
we spend the holiday weekend with family and friends, please take a
moment to reflect on the service of all those who have fought to protect
our nation and defend democracy.
Please watch my video about
the importance of remembering our troops and their
sacrifice.
Sincerely,
Contact
