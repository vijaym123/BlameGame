My Trip to South Asia and the Middle East
Earlier this month, I traveled to India
, Afghanistan
, Pakistan
, and Qatar
with Senator Tim Kaine (D-Virginia). I learned a great deal about the
regions, our interests there, and how best to further American
interests in those countries. I was also honored to meet with some of
the people from Maine who are supporting air operations over Syria and
Iraq, as well as troops and civilians stationed in Afghanistan.

Economic Development in Aroostook County
There is a lot of optimism and excitement in the Ashland area right now
with several facilites opening their doors and existing businesses
starting to hire more workers. I called it a "boom town" when I was
there at the beginning of the month to celebrate the grand openings of
the Irving Woodlands Ashland Sawmill and Ecoshel Cedar Shingle
manufacturing, as well as applaud the official restart of operations at
the ReEnergy facility, and tour several other businesses in the area.
Read more about my visit and the exciting developments in Aroostook
HERE
.
The recently-rebuilt and energy efficient Irving Woodlands Ashland
Sawmill is expected to create and sustain approximately 65 jobs within
the region.
I spoke with Mark Bossie during the restart of operations at ReEnergy
in Ashland. Mark is the Director of Operations and Maintenance at the
facility.
Surveying America's Nuclear Facilities
Together with Senator Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), I toured the Los Alamos
National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico. The
national laboratories are responsible for maintaining a safe, secure,
and effective nuclear deterrent for the United States and for other
science-related functions in support of U.S. national security
interests. You can read more about the visit HERE.
