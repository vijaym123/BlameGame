Dear David Doherty:
I will be meeting one-on-one with constituents at the first of many mobile district office hours in El Cerrito,
Saturday, March 14th from 11 am to 1 pm . During my first term, I plan to hold mobile district office hours across the district to provide residents with direct access to their Congressman&rsquo;s office.
People are busy and I want them to have easy and direct access to the information and assistance they need. That&rsquo;s why, in addition to two district offices, I have instituted a plan to host mobile district office hours at locations all across Contra Costa County during my first two years in office.
I will be available to share thoughts and to answer questions on federal legislation, and to assist with issues related to Social Security, the Veteran&rsquo;s Administration, passports, or other federal agencies.
&bull;
What : Congressman DeSaulnier&rsquo;s Mobile District Office Hours &bull;
When : Saturday, March 14, from 11 AM to 1 PM &bull;
