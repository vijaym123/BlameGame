COMMENT:
This
table
is
here
for
the
soul
purpose
of
explaining
the
template
components.
COMMENT:

may
this

before

It

here
to
offer
suggestions
on
way
to
avoid
common
problems
COMMENT:
If
tables

borders,
they
are
visible
only
as
a
mechanism
to
make
them
easier
to
see
or
for
demonstration
purposes.
Use
borders
sparingly
in
your
design.
COMMENT:
Table
borders
do
not
always
align

and
should
be
set
to
zero
before
publishing
unless
the
design
is
very
simple
and
is
pleasing
with
borders.
COMMENT:
This
template
used

COMMENT:
A

COMMENT:
TABLE
COMMENT:
TBODY
-
optional
(table
body
is
used
to
group
the
parts
of
a
table
with
a
header,
body,
and
footer
when
you
want
a
spreadsheet
effect)
COMMENT:
TR
(table
row)
COMMENT:
TD
(table
data
or
column
-
this
is
where
your
actual
content
or
text
is
located)
COMMENT:
Style
concepts:
Tables
carry
NO
style
declarations.
Only
declare
border,
cellspacing,
width,
bgcolor
(background
color)
and
alignment
attributes
to
a
table.
Think
of
the
table
as
providing
the
boundary
for
the
enclosed
content
you
place
within
it.
COMMENT:
Style
may
be
added
to
the
TD
tag
(table
data)
or
"cell/column"
within
a
table.
COMMENT:
This
will
help
simplify
the
styling
of
the
content
within
the
table.
COMMENT:
The
TD
is
where
you
may
declare
a
default
font-family,
font-size,
color
(this
applies
to
the
font
only),
text-alignment
(left/right/centered)
and
a
valign
(alignment
of
the
content
from
top/middle/bottom
of
the
TD
cell.
COMMENT:
By
declaring
a
default
style
on
the
TD,
you
avoid
the
need
to
apply
a
style
to
every
paragragh,
DIV
(Division),
header,
or
other
text
in
your
content.
COMMENT:
You
may
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the
HTML
code
of
this
COMMENTS
table
you
will
see
how
these
concepts
are
being
applied.
COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of
style,
size
and
table
attributes
that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
shorter
tables
on
top
of
each
other
to
form
one
very
long
series
of
tables
and
avoid
the
page
breaking
problem
in
Outlook.

COMMENT:
Things
to
Remember:
Design
for
multiple
platforms
(Windows,
Apple,
Linux,
Mobile).
COMMENT:
This
means
you
design
narrow
tables
(660
pixels
or
less)
to
accomodate
mobile
devices.
COMMENT:
Declare
fonts
with
the
least
likely
to
be
installed
first
or
the
least
popular
platform
first
and
add
more
common
fonts/platforms
to
the
end
of
the
font-family
list.
