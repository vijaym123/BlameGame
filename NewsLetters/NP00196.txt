Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major
General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas to inform Galvestons
slaves that they were free men and women. From that date forward,
Americans have marked Juneteenth as a celebration of the end to one of
the darkest chapters in our nations history.
As we
commemorate the 150th Juneteenth, we honor the sacrifices made by generations
of African-Americans who embraced freedom and helped to expand equality
throughout our nation. It is because of the conviction of these men
and women that African-Americans lead some of Americas greatest
industries and institutions. One of the greatest testaments to the enduring
strength of freedom and equality is the two term presidency of the
nations first African-American president, President Barack
Obama.
We have made tremendous strides in expanding freedom and equality
for all. However, millions of Americans feel powerless in the face of
a system that is rigged against thema direct result of unequal
opportunities, failing school systems and the prevalence of disturbing
police interactions particularly with men and women of color. It is the
duty of every American to work toward ending these realities and
providing the hope of the American dream to every American regardless of
their race or background. Just as Major General Gordon Granger carried the
shared responsibility of freedom and equality into Galveston, Texas,
we all have the responsibility of ensuring that freedom, justice and
equality reaches every aspect of our society.
As we reflect
on this historic anniversary of Juneteenth, may we recommit ourselves
to defending freedom, justice and equality for every American in every
community in Nevada and across United States of
America.
