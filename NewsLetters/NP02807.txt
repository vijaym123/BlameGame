Dear Friend,
I
travel a lot across Northeast Georgia, listening to constituents' stories
about over-regulation, and shared one with Congress this week.
Arguing for the
Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Act , I told
naysayers, who crave Big Government, about a small business in the
Ninth District.
My friend told me he'd be
hiring a new employee to add to his 10-person team. Happy for every new
job, I congratulated him. "That's great," I said. "You'll have 10
percent job growth." He corrected me. "No, Doug, you don't understand. I'm
hiring someone to keep us compliant with federal
regulations."
"My new employee, unfortunately, won't
contribute to our bottom line," he told me. I understood. As a small business
owner in Gainesville, who owned a scrapbook store with my wife, I
know how hard it is move the bottom line a little. Every second my friend
and his employees would be spending filling out more paperwork would
interfere with providing their customers quality products and
services.

Treats Congress to Stories from the Ninth
District
The
Regulatory
Flexibility Act
I helped pass would compel federal agencies to
consider their economic impact on small businesses -- and the
Sunshine
for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act
I introduced with Sen.
Charles Grassley this week would halt so-called "sue and settle"
regulation by litigation.
Because they do not
have popular support, special interest groups and bureaucrats are
devising burdensome environmental regulations outside the normal,
transparent process Congress instituted. Activist lawyers are suing agencies
to speed regulations, collecting attorney fees and writing their own
rules without public approval.
As a result
of my bill, these hasty "sue and settle" agreements would become open
to public participation. In the light of day, most would die, and
small businesses would grow. In the 114th Congress, I will continue to
fight for Northeast Georgians' right to earn a living.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
