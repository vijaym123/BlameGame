On
Palm Sunday and the eve of Passover, our entire community was shocked to
learn of a horrific act of hate that led to the deaths of three of
our beloved community
members.
I was heartbroken to learn of the shootings at the Jewish
Community Center and Village Shalom in Overland Park. Brooke and I are
praying for the families and victims of this tragedy and our office
continues to stand ready to provide needed
assistance.
While facts are being gathered by local and
national law enforcement, it is difficult to accept and understand the
answers to many questions surrounding the senseless act of hate that was
committed.
During these most
difficult times, a tight-knit and caring community is often our best
source of support and comfort. Overland Park and the entire greater Kansas
City area is a shining example of family in community. We will
comfort each other, support each other, and help each other through this
tragedy.
What happened on Sunday
may have broken our hearts, but it has stiffened our resolve. We go
forward unified in thought, word and
deed.
Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to the families
of the victims
lost.
