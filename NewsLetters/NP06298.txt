As the Representative of Fort
Hood, known as the Great Place, Im uniquely familiar with the
sacrifices our war fighters have to make. These young men and women have been
away from their families for years fighting to keep us safe.
Ultimately, in the history of war, we have almost always had to put boots on
the ground to finish the fight. We would be nave to think that fighting
ISIL is an exception.
Lets not put our sons
and daughters in the line of fire without rebuilding the United
States Military. Our policies have taken our military down to pre-World War
II levels at one of the most dangerous time in our Nations history.
Our men and women deserve the best equipment and training to defend
them. They also deserve to know that their job is secure when they come
back home from war. A pink slip is no way to thank our troops for
their service.
On Wednesday, September 17,
2014, to make sure our warriors at Fort Hood get their paychecks,
the House passed
H.J.Res. 124 ,
the
Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 , by a vote
of 319-108 (See
Roll Call
#509 ).
The Continuing Resolution keeps the government
open and keeps our troops funded through December 11, 2014.
On Thursday, September 18, 2014, the House
passed
H.R. 4 , the
Jobs for America
Act , by a vote of 253-163 (See
Roll Call #513 ).
The
Jobs for America Act
contains 15 House-passed bills
that will help get people back to work, increase their take-home
pay, provide immediate tax relief, and expand opportunities for all
Americans.
The measure repeals the Obamacare 30-hours-per-week
definition, and repeals the Medical Device Tax.
This legislation
also ensures that Congress has the power to vote on all new major
regulations before they can be enforced. Lastly, H.R. 4 promotes
responsible and effective timber production, and allows the U.S. to domestically
develop the resources critical to economic development and
competitiveness.
Finally, the House passed
H.R. 2 , the
American Energy Solutions for
Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act,
by a vote of
226-191 (See
Roll Call
#515 ).
H.R. 2 contains 14 House-passed bills that will create
jobs, increase domestic energy production, and improve American energy
independence.
With gas prices hovering near $3.50 per gallon,
middle class families need a break.
Thats our
boarding pass and I am looking forward to getting back to Texas. Look
for me around the district. I will be in town until November
12 th . See yall at home.
