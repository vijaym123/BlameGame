I'm sure you've heard -- former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton recently admitted that she used a
private
email account to conduct
official
business.
This
raises serious questions about security, transparency, and accountability
surrounding the way our nation's leaders do
business.
This news has wide-ranging implications
for the Administration's compliance with federal laws -- including the
Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act -- and
congressional oversight.
So to
get to the bottom of this latest scandal, I sent a letter last week to
the State Department demanding answers from the Inspector General
about the ongoing investigation.
You can read the full letter
here .
