David --
We know you&rsquo;re a top Democrat -- but you haven&rsquo;t pitched in yet toward our MUST-HIT April fundraising goal!!
Pitched in to Critical April Goal:
NOT YET
(give now)
FEC Deadline:
24 hours
We&rsquo;re at risk of being CRUSHED by the GOP in early investment.
In the last 4 months alone, the GOP has found a way to unlock a treasure trove of SIX-FIGURE donations from their megadonors.
We don&rsquo;t have the GOP&rsquo;s wealthy financiers. We Democrats rely on our loyal grassroots supporters.
If we don&rsquo;t raise the $172,000 we still need for our make-or-break April FEC Goal in the next 24 hours, the GOP could lock up 2016 RIGHT NOW.
We&rsquo;re TRIPLE-MATCHING all gifts before the deadline! Pitch in now -- time is running out.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
