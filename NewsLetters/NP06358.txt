Update from Senator Bob Corker
September
15, 2014
Remembering September 11,
2001
Senator Corker released the following statement marking the anniversary of
the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States:
May
this somber anniversary serve as a reminder of the durability of the
American spirit, the countless acts of courage, and the displays of
selflessness by so many Americans on that fateful day and in the years
since September 11, 2001, said Corker. Our military men and women and
their families who answered the call to defend this country have made
tremendous sacrifices on our behalf and continue to inspire all of us
through their public service.
President Exercising Poor Judgment Not Seeking
Authorization from Congress
Senator Corker, ranking
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued the
following statement regarding President Obamas address to the nation on the
U.S. strategy against the terrorist organization the Islamic State of
Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS):
While much of the wording
in the presidents speech was good, the substance of how we accomplish
what he laid out is what matters. I believe the president is
exercising poor judgment by not explicitly seeking an authorization from
Congress where consensus can be reached around a substantive plan of action
and support can be built for an operation that he has described will
take several years, said Corker.
Plan to Address U.S. Passport Holders Joining
ISIS
Senator Corker this week led a group of 14
senators in sending a
letter
to State Department
Secretary John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson
requesting more information and calling on the administration to provide a
plan for dealing with the large number of U.S. and visa waiver country
passport holders suspected of fighting alongside the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist organizations. The
administration has expressed concern about these individuals, but has yet to
provide a clear and comprehensive plan for tracking and preventing them
from traveling to the U.S. to potentially carry out terrorist
acts.
We write today to encourage you to take immediate action
to prevent U.S. and western country passport holders fighting alongside
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Jabat al-Nusra or other
terrorist organizations from traveling to the U.S. to commit acts of
terrorism against the homeland, wrote the senators.
On
September 3, 2014, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated that the U.S.
government is aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports
who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIS forces. The following
day the Pentagon clarified that approximately 100 American passport
holders are operating inside of Syria and roughly one dozen of those
individuals are fighting alongside ISIS. Reports also indicate that
hundreds of additional westerners have joined the ranks of ISIS, Jabat
al-Nusra, and other terrorist organizations in that
region.
CBO Confirms Corker Housing
Finance Reform Bill a Win-Win for American
Taxpayer
Senator Corker, a member of the Senate Banking Committee,
issued the following statement on the release of the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report on the Housing Finance Reform and
Taxpayer Protection Act of 2014 (S.1217), which passed the Senate Banking
Committee on May 15 in a 13-9 bipartisan vote.
Todays
CBO report further confirms that the bipartisan bill passed by the
Senate Banking Committee in May is a win-win for the American taxpayer and
should serve as the framework for how our housing finance system
should look in the future, said Corker. This bill not only protects
taxpayers against future losses, but it also reduces the deficit by $58
billion over 10 years and creates a more competitive, dynamic housing
finance system. It is time for our country to move beyond the status quo
and finally end the failed model of private gains and public
losses.
According to the report, CBO estimates that enacting
the bill would decrease federal deficits by $58 billion over the
2015-2024 period. Additionally, CBO expects that the government would take
on less risk under FMIC guarantees than it would from continued
operation of the GSEs under current law.
