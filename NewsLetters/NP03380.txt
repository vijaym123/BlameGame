Video of the
Week:
I talked with Loretta
Boniti, Senior Political Reporter, News 14 Carolina about the great
opportunity we have in the 114th Congress to move forward on jobs, health
care, veterans and other important issues to provide real solutions for
the American people.

America's New Congress got off to a great start last
week and continued with a flurry of activity this week in the
House.
I
re-introduced H.R. 270 -- The Flexibility in Health IT Reporting (Flex-IT) Act --
to ensure that health care providers receive the flexibility they need
to comply with strict deadlines imposed on them by the Department of
Health and Human Services. This legislation will improve healthcare
outcomes for hospitals and physicians back home and will prevent them
from being penalized with expensive fines.
Additionally, we need to continue to
fight President Obamas unilateral executive action on immigration. As I
have stated, we must work to fight illegal immigration and seal the
border. Currently states face what is, essentially, an unfunded mandate
when it comes to services that must be provided to illegal immigrants.
To put an end to this, I introduced H.R. 369, the Accountability in
Foreign Aid Act, which would reimburse states for funds spent on illegal
immigrants with funding from foreign aid accounts. Our states deserve
a real solution to this problem, so its time to redirect funding and
prioritize our local governments here at home.
Thank you for the opportunity to
represent you in Congress, and please contact my office if there is
ever anything I can do for you.
Republican Women's Policy Committee Meeting:
This week, members of the Republican Women's Policy
Committee
met to talk about their legislative goals and
initiatives in America's New
Congress!
Congresswomen Elise Stefanik (NY-21) and Mimi Walters
(CA-45) are two of the newly-elected freshmen members of Congress who
joined the U.S. House this January. They joined returning members of
the RWPC this past week for our
meeting.
RWPC members had the opportunity to meet
in the Lincoln Room of the Capitol to discuss our upcoming agenda. It
was wonderful to speak with some of the new ladies who joined the
committee.
