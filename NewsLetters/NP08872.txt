Dear Friend:
Yesterday, Senate Republicans blocked legislation that would have helped nearly 2.3 million Californians struggling with student loan debt to refinance their loans at today's lower interest rates. Not only did Republicans oppose this bill, they filibustered it - stopping us from even debating it.
This is just the latest in a long line of legislation to help middle-class families and the economy that has been blocked by Republicans, including equal-pay legislation, a minimum-wage hike and energy-efficiency legislation.
It is time for Congress to act to ease the burden of student debt, which is hurting our economy and our families and tearing at the fabric of the American dream. To see my speech on the Senate floor on why addressing the student loan crisis is so critical, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
