To top off the GOP&rsquo;s damaging actions over the past three months, they are voting on their budget plan TODAY.
David -- After three months of reckless acts and disturbing bills, Republicans are voting on their budget plan TODAY.
And it&rsquo;s even worse than we expected.
Medicare decimated. Social Security in jeopardy. Obamacare repealed. Tax breaks for the wealthy, no help for the rest of us.
But the GOP controls Congress -- there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to stop them, right?
NO.
We can FIGHT BACK.
Our Million Dollar March campaign will hold vulnerable Republicans accountable for their budget votes and start the work of defeating them.
We&rsquo;ll put our strong Democratic agenda in front of the American people -- one that protects Social Security and Medicare and puts working families first. But we need your help right this minute -- because the budget votes are happening TODAY.
