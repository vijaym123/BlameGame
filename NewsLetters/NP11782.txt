Army Corps to Dedicate $1 Million to
Dredging Black River
Rep. Miller applauds Army Corps&#8217; decision to dredge Port Huron&#8217;s Black River; says project is necessary for economic and recreational activity
Washington
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10), member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, issued the following statement on the Army Corps of Engineers&#8217; decision to dedicate $25 million for navigation projects in the Great Lakes,
including $1 million to dredge Port Huron&#8217;s Black River:
&#8220;I applaud the Army Corps&#8217; decision to address the backlog of navigation and dredging projects in the Great Lakes, specifically Port Huron&#8217;s Black River.
The Black River is essential to the economic development and success to Port Huron.
It also plays
host to major sporting events that boost the local tourism industry, like the annual Port Huron to Mackinac race.
This project, which includes dredging 12,000 feet of maintained channels up to depths of 20 feet, will help sailboats travel freely, especially
those with deep drafts.
&#8220;Those of us who grew up on the Great Lakes understand the important role they play to our economic and recreational livelihood. Billions worth of commerce travel across and between the Great Lakes annually, and they are home to recreational sporting, boating
and fishing activities that help our economy and create jobs.&#8221;
