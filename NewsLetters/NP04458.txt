Dear
Friends,
This past Friday, the House voted to pass,
HR
5682
the Keystone XL pipeline bill. Im proud to say I voted for the
bill.
The Keystone XL pipeline is an amazing opportunity to
create jobs for the American people. Possessing the ability to generate
42,000 jobs, the Keystone XL pipeline provides a chance for Americas
unemployed to finally get back to work. Some argue that this bill is
a waste of time, but I disagree.
In North Georgia, I have talked
to several constituents about the importance of jobs, and they have
expressed their frustrations when looking for employment. While others
maintain that the pipeline does not do enough, the effort to repair
this economy has to start somewhere. 42,000 jobs will put millions of
people in jobs when getting the economy back together again. HR 5682
accomplishes exactly what American citizens have sent me to do. I am here
to work for the people of this great nation and help those in need of
employment find that job.
I hope this bill will see action
in the Senate soon. As always,
let me know
your
views on the issue.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
