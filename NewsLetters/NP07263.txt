Dear Friends,
One of the most important duties of members of Congress is
ensuring the care of those brave Americans who answered the call of serving
in the Armed Forces and were willing to lay down their lives for our
country.
When problems come to light, it is
imperative that we respond. You deserve to know about that response,
and this update explains what Congress has done to reverse the
breakdown at the Veterans Administration with the goal of ensuring that our
veterans receive the best possible care as quickly as possible, and to
restore confidence and excellence in the delivery of care at the
VA.
Last week, the House passed the
Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 . This bipartisan
legislation restores full and prompt access to medical care,
including care at non-VA facilities as long as the veteran is enrolled in the
VA health care system as of August 1, 2014, is a newly discharged
combat veteran unable to secure a VA appointment within 30 days, or
resides more than 40 miles from the nearest VA
facility.
Also, the bill creates the Congressional Commission on
Care, which will carefully evaluate access to care throughout the VA
health care system.
This legislation is the first step toward
meeting our obligation to our veterans.
We have more work to do to
restore the confidence and excellence in delivery of care that rises
to the level of the valor of our troops and the debt we owe to
Americas veterans.
As a reminder, my office
stands ready to help any active duty service member or veteran, or their
families on a wide range of
issues.
Recently, my office was able to help the family of deceased U.S. Army
veteran Sergeant Ryan Dickinson. In the wake of his murder at Fort
Hood in September 2013, Sgt. Dickinsons widow and their two young
children were at risk of not receiving the proceeds of his military life
insurance policy. Sgt. Dickinson had been in the process of applying to
upgrade his disability rating from 70 percent service-connected to 100
percent. If granted within one year of his date of discharge,
this upgrade would have extended the time available to him to convert
his life insurance policy from a service member policy to a veterans
policy.
Upon learning the policy had
been cancelled, Sgt. Dickinsons family contacted my office. We
were able to work with the family to show the VA that not only would
the upgrade have been granted, it would have been granted within the
first year after Sgt. Dickinsons discharge. As a result, I am pleased to
report his family received the $400,000 benefit provided for in the
policy.
Helping the thousands of veterans
residing in New Yorks first district and representing their families
in Congress is an honor and privilege. Please do not hesitate to
contact my office if you need assistance, and we will do everything we
can to help you reach a favorable outcome.
Sincerely,
Congressman Tim Bishop
First District of New
York
