Friend,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving and the opportunity to enjoy the
day with friends and family. I joined with my daughters and some great
men and women from Naval Base Kitsap to serve meals at the Salvation
Army in Bremerton. Then on Saturday, I took part in some Small Business
Saturday shopping on Bainbridge Island. There are a few fun pictures
from the week up on my Facebook page
.
On to the meat and potatoes of this update: This week we had some big
news to announce.
Announcing the Olympic Peninsula Collaborative
I've always said we don't have to choose between economic development
and environmental protection.
Earlier this week, I was very happy to announce a new partnership
between stakeholders in conservation, timber, and government that I
hope will prove that's true.
It's called the Olympic Peninsula Collaborative and it will show how we
can build consensus and can bring folks together to simultaneously
create a more environmentally healthy forest, provide for increased,
sustainable timber harvests on the Olympic National Forest, and provide
economic benefits to timber communities on the Peninsula.
One of the reasons I care so much about these issues is because I grew
up on the Olympic Peninsula and saw firsthand what happened to folks
when mills closed down and folks were laid off.
Unfortunately given
the challenges of recent decades, there's often a lot of toxicity in
the dialogue about land-use issues on the Peninsula.
It's my hope that we can turn down the volume a bit and have a
commonsense conversation about these issues. That's part of the
rationale behind this effort.

.
What I like about a collaborative approach is that it brings people who
might normally disagree together around common goals. We can do more,
and we are much stronger when we work on things we agree on rather than
fight over things we disagree on.
We're just getting started and there's much more to do. I'll be sure to
keep you posted as we announce specific projects.
My Innovation Bill Passes in the Science, Space, and Technology
Committee
We also had some good news yesterday from the Science, Space, and
Technology Committee. A bill I've co-sponsored and championed, the
TRANSFER Act, was passed by unanimous consent. The TRANSFER Act is a
bipartisan piece of legislation that would help spur America's
competitiveness and create new jobs by helping innovators and
entrepreneurs commercialize their ideas.
To remain competitive in the 21st century, we need to step up our game
and look for ways to facilitate innovation by giving our universities,
entrepreneurs, and small businesses the tools to grow ideas into
commercial products.
Passing the TRANSFER Act will help stimulate the growth of new ideas,
new investments, and new small businesses. This legislation not only
provides early-stage proof of concept funding, but encourages mentoring
through creating programs to provide advice, entrepreneurial education,
project management, and technology and business development expertise.
The legislation will now move on to the Small Business Committee for
passage. I'll keep you updated on its progress!
Puget Sound Caucus Hearing
Many of us care about maintaining a healthy Puget Sound. The Sound is
an icon of our region that has weaved itself into the DNA of those of
us who live here. But not only is protecting the Sound consistent with
our environmental values, it's part of our state's economic imperative.
Puget Sound is a cornerstone that supports tourism, fishing, shellfish
harvesting, and other important industries.
In our ongoing effort to protect the Sound, this week, Representative
Denny Heck and I hosted our first Puget Sound Recovery Caucus
roundtable discussion in Washington, D.C. We had an extraordinary
turnout that included representatives of the Puget Sound Partnership,
along with folks from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park
Service, Department of Interior, NOAA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and EPA Region 10 Administrator Dennis McLerran. The meeting was a good
follow-up on the successful briefing we held this past August in Tacoma.
The meeting was timely, following on the release of the Puget Sound
Partnership's 2013 State of the Sound Report. That report detailed the
initiatives on which our state has made progress and identified the
areas in which we are coming up short.
While I was encouraged to hear we've made strides in restoring
shellfish beds, beaches, and estuaries, there have been mixed results
in the progress of on-site sewage, shoreline armoring, sand development
and cover, freshwater, marine sediment, toxins in fish, and worsening
circumstances for the health of our marine waters and the orca and
herring populations.
We've got work to do. Our work on Puget Sound recovery efforts is only
just beginning and with another budget cycle fast approaching, we have
to highlight the importance of the Puget Sound to our economy in
Washington State. Both Representative Heck and I as well as the other
members of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus are committed to working in
a coordinated effort with Washington State and our federal partners to
make meaningful strides in improving the health of the Puget Sound.
For me, making progress on this is not just about the impact to our
economy. As the dad of two little girls, I want to make sure Puget
Sound remains one of our state's crown jewels for generations to come.
Upcoming Telephone Town Hall
Finally, I'll be holding one more telephone town hall before the year
ends, this coming Wednesday, 12/11 at 6pm PT. I work for you, and I
like to make sure that I continue to be accessible and accountable to
you. If you'd like to be a part of it, please email your name and phone
number to kilmer.teletownhall@mail.house.gov or sign up here
.
As always, thanks for reading and hope to talk with you soon.
Sincerely,
Derek

Friend,
I
hope
you
had
a
great
Thanksgiving
and
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
day
with
friends
and
family.
I
joined
with
my
daughters
and
some
great
men
and
women
from
Naval

Kitsap
to

the
Salvation

on
Saturday,
I
took

some
Small

Bainbridge
Island. There
are
a
few
fun
pictures
from
the

On
to
the
meat
and
potatoes
of
this
update:
This
week
we
had
some
big
news
to
announce.
Announcing
the
Olympic
Peninsula
Collaborative
I&#8217;ve
always
said
we
don&#8217;t
have
to
choose
between
economic
development
and
environmental
protection.
Earlier
this
week,
I
was
very
happy
to
announce
a
new
partnership
between
stakeholders
in
conservation,
timber,
and
government
that
I
hope
will
prove
that&#8217;s

It&#8217;s
called

Olympic

Collaborative
and
it
will
show
how
we

One
of
the
reasons
I
care
so
much
about
these

is
because
I
grew

a

the

What
I
like
about
a
collaborative
approach
is
that
it
brings
people
who
might
normally
disagree
together
around
common
goals.
We
can
do
more,
and
we
are
much
stronger
when
we
work
on
things
we
agree
on
rather
than
fight
over
things
we
disagree
on.
We&#8217;re
just
getting
started
and
there&#8217;s
much
more
to
do. I&#8217;ll
be
sure
to
keep
you
posted
as
we
announce
specific
projects.
My
Innovation
Bill
Passes
in
the
Science,
Space,
and
Technology
Committee
We
also
had
some
good
news
yesterday
from
the
Science,
Space,
and
Technology
Committee.
A
bill
I've
co-sponsored
and
championed,
the
TRANSFER
Act,
was
passed
by
unanimous

The
TRANSFER
Act
is
a
bipartisan

of
legislation
that
would
help
spur
America's
competitiveness
and
create
new
jobs
by
helping
innovators
and
entrepreneurs
commercialize
their

To
remain
competitive
in
the
21st
century,
we
need
to
step
up
our
game
and
look
for
ways
to
facilitate
innovation
by
giving
our
universities,
entrepreneurs,
and
small
businesses
the

products.
Passing
the
TRANSFER
Act
will
help
stimulate
the
growth
of
new

new

and
new
small
businesses.
This
legislation
not

provides
early-stage

but
encourages
mentoring
through
creating
programs
to
provide

entrepreneurial
education,
project

and
business
development
expertise.
The
legislation
will
now
move
on
to
the
Small

Committee
for
passage.
I'll
keep
you
updated
on
its
progress!
Puget
Sound
Caucus
Hearing
Many
of

care
about
maintaining
a
healthy
Puget

is

and
EPA
Region

Administrator
Dennis
McLerran. The
meeting

on
Puget

recovery
efforts
is
only

and
with
another
budget

fast

we
have
to
highlight
the
importance
of
the
Puget

to
our
economy
in
Washington
State. Both
Representative
Heck
and
I
as
well
as
the
other
members
of
the
Puget
Sound
Recovery
Caucus
are
committed
to
working
in
a
coordinated
effort
with
Washington
State
and
our
federal
partners
to
make
meaningful
strides
in
improving
the
health
of
the
Puget
Sound.
For
me,
making
progress
on
this
is
not
just
about
the
impact
to
our
economy. As
the
dad
of
two
little
girls,
I
want
to
make
sure
Puget
Sound
remains
one
of
our
state&#8217;s
crown
jewels
for
generations
to
come.
Upcoming

I&#8217;ll
be
holding

town
hall

the
year
ends,
this

at

work
for
you,

I

sure
that
I
continue
