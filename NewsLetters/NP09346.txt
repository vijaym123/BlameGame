Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
DOTCOM Act Hitches Ride On Defense Bill To House Approval
In passing the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4435
) 325-98
Thursday, the House of Representatives included my amendment mirroring
language from the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters
(DOTCOM) Act of 2014. I introduced the DOTCOM Act in response to the
Obama Administration's announcement in March that it would be pursuing
a process that could remove the United States from its oversight role
of critical Internet functions.
For over two decades, U.S. oversight of the Internet's domain name
system has kept the global Internet free and open. Though dismissed by
some as merely a "clerical" role of assigning and matching domain names
with IP addresses, U.S. stewardship of these basic functions has
prevented authoritarian governments from censoring content or
restricting access to websites beyond their own borders.
While the administration says it won't accept a proposal that puts the
Internet in the hands of another government or government-led entity,
there's no guarantee that won't happen after the initial transfer takes
place. But one thing is for sure: once our authority is gone, it's gone
for good. Click below to see me speak on behalf of my amendment on the
House floor:
The amendment requires that the nonpartisan Government Accountability
Office study any potential consequences before the administration may
take action.
VA Accountability Act: Reports that dozens of veterans died after being
put on "secret" waiting lists and facing delays in medical care at
multiple U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals across the
country have sparked understandable outrage.
In response, I joined the 390-33 majority in the House on Wednesday in
approving the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability
Act, H.R. 4031
. The
legislation gives the Veterans Affairs secretary greater authority to
fire senior executives for poor performance.
Water Resources Compromise Legislation Passes Overwhelmingly
On Tuesday, I was pleased to support the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA, H.R. 3080
)
Conference Report. The House-Senate compromise passed the House by a
vote of 412-4.
This is the first water resources bill approved by Congress in seven
years and likely the first ever without earmarks. WRRDA is vital to
Illinois, where more than 77 million tons of commodities worth over $28
billion travel up and down our rivers each year.
The conference report reforms the bureaucracy to accelerate project
completion and streamline environmental reviews. It also invests in
ports and water infrastructure to benefit navigation, trade, and
commerce, spurring job creation and economic growth.
Restarting Yucca Mountain Would Reverse 'Waste' Of $40 Billion
May 16 marked a milestone for the Department of Energy's management of
nuclear power. The agency ceased collecting nuclear waste fees from
ratepayers in response to a court order that found the DOE was not
complying with the law and had no feasible plan in place to store the
country's nuclear waste.
CNN's Situation Room featured a story on this action and highlighted
the billions of dollars the government has collected from consumers for
decades to pay for a "non-existent" nuclear waste site. I appeared on
the segment and expressed that the best nuclear waste plan would be for
the Obama Administration to comply with the law and restart the Yucca
Mountain project. Click below to view the story:
To get our nuclear future back on track, the Secretary of Energy simply
needs to carry out his obligation and restart Yucca Mountain. Short of
that, I am glad this annual theft of $750 million from electricity
consumers has finally come to an end.
Announcements
Thomas Jefferson Award: I was proud to be named as a recipient of the
2014 Thomas Jefferson Award this month by the International Foodservice
Distributors Association (IFDA)
. The IFDA cited "positive votes on legislation to support
job growth, the private sector and free market principles." During each
Congress, IFDA presents the Thomas Jefferson Award to Senators and
Members of Congress who demonstrate their commitment to increasing
economic opportunity and reducing government regulation.
Main Street Heroes: As part of the recent National Small Business Week,
the National Retail Federation
recognized several Members of Congress as "Heroes of Main Street" for
their advocacy of small business and the U.S. retail industry. I was
honored to be one of those selected as a supporter of "a pro-economic
growth policy," according to the federation.

May

marked

nuclear

site.
I
appeared
on

expressed
that
the
best
nuclear
waste
plan
would
be
for
the
Obama

to
comply

To

our
nuclear

back
on

the
Secretary

needs

Yucca
Mountain.
Short
of
that,
I
am
glad
this
annual
theft
of
$750
million
from
electricity
consumers
has
finally
come
to
an
end.
