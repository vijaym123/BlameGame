ICYMI: BILL INTRODUCTIONS THIS
WEEK
This week, I introduced H. J. Res. 9, a
joint resolution which restores Congresss constitutional authority to
ban the desecration of the United States flag. Until invalidated
by the 1989 U.S. Supreme Courts decision in
Texas v. Johnson , 48 states had laws banning flag
desecration. H. J. Res. 9 reinstates Congresss authority to protect our
flag by giving states the ability to take a stand on this important
issue, which states have overwhelmingly supported throughout our
nations history.
Americans have
continually
made the ultimate sacrifice for the values
espoused in our flag, and as a veteran, I believe it is disgraceful to
allow it to be desecrated. Our flag is not only one of the greatest
symbols of our nation, its one of the most prominent symbols of
freedom and democracy in the world. We should be allowed to protect
it.
Members of Congress have bipartisanly
supported the passage of this amendment since the 1989 Supreme Court
decision. To date, a joint resolution giving Congress power to prohibit the
physical desecration of the American flag has been passed by the House
six times, most recently in 2005. Passage in the Senate has
fallen just short of the 67 required votes three times, most recently in
2006.
The final text of the joint
resolution can be found
here .
I also introduced
H.R. 178, the Terrorist Denaturalization and Passport Revocation Act, to
address the dangerous and unique threat to our homeland posed by U.S.
citizens actively joining the ranks of terrorist organizations.
Specifically, the
Terrorist Denaturalization and Passport Revocation Act amends the
Immigration and Nationality Act by including certain acts of allegiance to
terrorist organizations as a renunciation of U.S. citizenship, which serves
as grounds for denaturalization. The bill also amends the
Passport Act to provide increased mechanisms for the U.S. State Department
and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when it comes to the
revocation of passports of U.S. citizens engaging in terrorist
activities.
When an American turns against their country by willfully
traveling overseas to join forces with terrorists, a revocation of
citizenship and the privileges it affords them is not only warranted, but
necessary to ensure that these citizens are not able to freely re-enter the
U.S. to carry out attacks on our homeland.
The final text of the bill can be found

WEEK IN REVIEW
On Tuesday, the 114th Congress commenced,
and I took my oath of office and was officially sworn in for my third
term. ( Watch the video here! )
Serving Third District Arkansans is an honor and a privilege, and as
your representative, your priorities are my priorities. This new
Congress is an unprecedented opportunity to address the many challenges
America faces today, and I look forward to working with the Republican
majorities in the House
and now the Senate
to not only find these
solutions and fight to restore fiscal responsibility and government
accountability in Washington, but also promote the conservative values
we hold dear.
The House continued our business by passing a
resolution Providing for the House Rules of the 114th Congress
( H.Res. 5 ) by a vote of 239-168 and the Hire More Heroes Act of 2015
( H.R. 22 ) by a vote of 412-0 on Tuesday
afternoon.
On Wednesday, the House took up
suspensions and passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization
Act of 2015 ( H.R. 26 ), the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of
2015 ( H.R. 23 ), the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2015
( H.R.
34 ), and the
Low-Dose Radiation Research Act of 2015 ( H.R.
35 ).
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R.
30 , the Save American Workers (SAW)
Act of 2015, by a vote of 252-172. H.R. 30 repeals the 30-hour
definition of full time employee in the Affordable Care Act for
purposes of the employer mandate and replaces it with a 40-hour definition
for full time employee. Obamacares 30-hour definition of a fulltime
employee puts 2.6 million Americans at risk of losing their jobs and
hours
it could slash wages by 25 percent. Those Obamacare was
designed to help most would actually be hurt the most if this provision was
left as is, and I am encouraged that the House has acted to make this
provision right. I hope the President will do the same.
On Friday,
the House passed
H.R. 3 , the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, by a vote of 266-153-1. H.R.
5682 authorizes the construction, connection, operation, and
maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline. The bill deems the Final
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Secretary of State
in January of 2014 sufficient to satisfy all the requirements of the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and any other federal
law that requires federal agency consultation or
review.
Over six years have passed since the
Keystone XL pipeline application was first submitted to the U.S.
Department of State, and all the while, instead of approving its construction,
President Obama has supported an energy agenda counterproductive to
American success. Throughout the 112th and 113th Congresses, my fellow
House Members and I have fought endless battles to overcome these
administration-instituted delays. Now, at the start of the 114th Congress,
Im hopeful that with the aid of the new Republican-led Senate, well
pass this legislation and give the President no choice but to finally
free the commonsense, shovel-ready Keystone XL pipeline from years of
Democratic roadblocks.
Next week, in addition to
suspensions the House will consider the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing
Small Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37), the Regulatory Accountability Act
of 2015 (H.R. 185), and the Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 240).
