Dear Friend,
This was the second of two consecutive in-district work weeks, and one
of the stops for the MO4U team was Pulaski County. A highlight of this
visit was a tour of the Life Care Center of Waynesville. This
state-of-the-art facility provides rehabilitation and long-term care
services that include individualized therapy to enable patients to
reach their full potential for quality living.
I was particularly impressed with the Center's Alzheimer's unit. The
Alzheimer's unit provides residents with nurses and therapists
specially trained in caring for Alzheimer's residents. And, since
Alzheimer's disease affects more than just patients, the Center hosts
support meetings for families and friends of loved ones who are
afflicted.
According to a study published in the April, 2013New England Journal of
Medicine, Alzheimer's is now the costliest disease in America,
outpacing cancer and heart disease. With America's aging population,
the number of senior citizens in this country who are affected by this
expensive and debilitating disease, estimated at five million, will
continue to grow. It is projected that the costs of Alzheimer's could
exceed $1.2 trillion a year by 2050 unless a breakthrough is found.
Given these skyrocketing costs, I sent a letter to the Secretary of
Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health, urging
them to increase funding for Alzheimer's research. We must find a cure
for this disease and find it soon. Until that happens, facilities like
the Life Care Center of Waynesville are a blessing providing valuable
services to both residents and their families.
Later, I spoke to the Pulaski County Rotary Club, updating luncheon
attendees on the ongoing events in Washington and on how I am working
to promote issues of importance to our district.

Robert
I then had the privilege of hosting a business roundtable with
business, civic, and community leaders from the Waynesville and St.
Robert areas.

Many important issues were raised during the meeting. First and
foremost, community leaders taking part in the meeting stressed the
importance of Fort Leonard Wood to the economic well-being of both
communities. It is vital that we keep it strong and look for
opportunities to expand the missions of the installation. As a member
of the House Armed Services Committee I will continue to fight for Fort
Leonard Wood to remain vital and to expand its duties and
responsibility.

Other issues of importance to Pulaski County citizens are similar to
those I hear from the good people in other parts of Missouri's Fourth
Congressional District: Concern with government overregulation, the
Obama Administration's war on coal in a state that is highly dependent
on coal for its energy needs, and worries that the President's health
care law is having unintended consequences. Those consequences include
school districts and other employers cutting hours of employees,
including bus drivers, to avoid the expense of having to comply with
the law's definition of "full time" workers. Once again, hardworking
Missouri citizens are offering common sense ideas that should be
considered by Washington, D.C. bureaucrats.
Not far from Pulaski County, I joined my Missouri Congressional
colleagues Jason Smith and Blaine Luetkemeyer for a tour of parts of
Mark Twain National Forest, which encompasses 1.5 million acres across
29 southern and central Missouri counties.

The tour was a follow-up to concerns raised by local groups over
prescribed burning on National Forest land. This tour provided an
opportunity for me to work with fellow legislators in the state to
raise the profile of land use issues and to encourage the forest
rangers to work closely with the Missouri forest products industry to
properly balance our precious natural resources. I remain committed to
working with all stakeholders to ensure these federal properties are
managed properly to improve the economic and environmental resources in
the state of Missouri.
A visit with the Centralia Kiwanis Club rounded out a busy week on the
road. It was good to discuss with community business leaders some of
the concerns I am addressing in Washington, including overregulation.
Several attendees shook their heads at the examples I offered of
government impediments standing in the way of job creators hoping to
hire new workers. While we have had some success pushing back egregious
rules and regulations (such as the Environmental Protection Agency's
proposed regulation of farm dust, its requirement that dairy farmers
build concrete containment barriers around their milk tanks, and the
Department of Labor's proposals last year that would have prevented
young people from working on farms) the job of eliminating waste and
nuisance regulations is far from over. I will continue to fight
unnecessary regulations hurting people and hindering jobs.
On another matter, President Obama met Japanese Prime Minister Abe this
week to talk trade, and I was honored to lead dozens of my House
colleagues in urging the Obama Administration to push Japan to
eliminate tariff and non-tariff trade barriers for U.S. agricultural
products as part of the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade
talks.
A letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Agriculture
Secretary Tom Vilsack expresses concern with Japan's demand for special
treatment for its agricultural sector. The fact is that Japan has not
made a comprehensive offer on market access for agricultural goods and
we are encouraging the Administration to continue the efforts that have
already been attempted, pointing out that giving in to Japan's demands
would be inconsistent with U.S. requests in previous trade deals.
"We commend previous efforts to expand market access with Japan,
including completion of a revised export for certain agricultural
products last year," states the letter. "We now seek assurances from
you that the U.S. will not close TPP negotiations with Japan's
participation unless Japan has agreed to eliminate tariff and
non-tariff trade barriers to agriculture."
As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I am committed to
continuing to work toward improved access to foreign markets for U.S.
agricultural products.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear

weeks,
and
one
of

was
Pulaski

the

The
tour
was
a
follow-up
to
concerns
raised
by
local
groups
over
prescribed
burning
on
National
Forest
land.
This
tour
provided
an
opportunity
for
me
to
work
with
fellow
legislators
in
the
state
to
raise
the
profile
of
land
use
issues
and
to
encourage
the
forest
rangers
to
work
closely
with
the
Missouri
forest
products
industry
to
properly
balance
our
precious
natural
resources.
I
remain
committed
to
working
with
all
stakeholders
to
ensure
these
federal
properties
are
managed
properly
to
improve
the
economic
and
environmental
resources
in
the
state
of
Missouri.
A
visit
with
the
Centralia
Kiwanis
Club
rounded
out
a
busy
week
on
the
road.
It
was
good
to
discuss
with
community
business
leaders
some
of
the
concerns
I
am
addressing
in
Washington,
including
overregulation.
Several
attendees
shook
their
heads
at
the
examples
I
offered
of
government
impediments
standing
in
the
way
of
job
creators
hoping
to
hire
new
workers.
While
we
have
had
some
success
pushing
back
egregious
rules
and
regulations
(such
as
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency&#8217;s
proposed
regulation
of
farm
dust,
its
requirement
that
dairy
farmers
build
concrete
containment
barriers
around
their
milk
tanks,
and
the
Department
of
Labor&#8217;s
proposals
last
year
that
would
have
prevented
young
people
from
working
on
farms)
the
job
of
eliminating
waste
and
nuisance
regulations
is
far
from
over.
I
will
continue
to
fight
unnecessary
regulations
hurting
people
and
hindering
jobs.
On
another
matter,
President
Obama
met
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Abe
this
week
to
talk
trade,
and
I
was
honored
to
lead
dozens
of
my
House
colleagues
in
urging
the
Obama
Administration
to
push
Japan
to
eliminate
tariff
and
non-tariff
trade
barriers
for
U.S.
agricultural
products
as
part
of
the
ongoing
Trans-Pacific
Partnership
(TPP)
trade
talks.
A
letter
to
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Michael
Froman
and
Agriculture
Secretary
Tom
Vilsack
expresses
concern
with
Japan&#8217;s
demand
for
special
treatment
for
its
agricultural
sector.
The
fact
is
that
Japan
has
not
made
a
comprehensive
offer
on
market
access
for
agricultural
goods
and
we
are
encouraging
the
Administration
to
continue
the
efforts
that
have
already
been
attempted,
pointing
out
that
giving
in
to
Japan&#8217;s
demands
would
be
inconsistent
with
U.S.
requests
in
previous
trade
deals.
&#8220;We
commend
previous
efforts
to
expand
market
access
with
Japan,
including
completion
of
a
revised
export
for
certain
agricultural
products
last
year,&#8221;
states
the
letter.
&#8220;We
now
seek
assurances
from
you
that
the
U.S.
will
not
close
TPP
negotiations
with
Japan&#8217;s
participation
unless
Japan
has
agreed
to
eliminate
tariff
and
non-tariff
trade
barriers
to
agriculture.&#8221;
As
a
member
of
the
House
Agriculture
Committee,
I
am
committed
to
continuing
to
work
toward
improved
access
to
foreign
markets
for
U.S.
agricultural
products.
Have
a
great
week.
