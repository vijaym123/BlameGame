Friend,
This week Congress did something that is unique in my short time here -
it passed a bill to fund government operations on a bipartisan basis
without the posturing and brinkmanship that has previously harmed our
economy.
I'm particularly happy that this bill includes funding that is critical
for our region, including important projects at Naval Base Kitsap and
money that will help clean up the Puget Sound.
While there is still more work to do and many things this funding bill
did not address, I hope that this is a positive sign that Congress can
put aside the partisanship and work together to address the many
challenges our nation is facing.
ANNOUNCING THE OLYMPIC PENINSULA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE
When I decided to run for Congress, I knew one of the major issues I
wanted to address was the persistent high unemployment rate on the
Olympic Peninsula.
Over the course of the last year, I've met with a wide range of
constituents to discuss just what it will take to get our local economy
really going again. As someone who was born and raised on the Peninsula
and spent a decade working in economic development, I know we actually
have a lot of the key building blocks in place. We have a skilled
workforce, strong ports, abundant natural resources, innovators, and
entrepreneurs who are laying the foundation for long-term economic
growth. It's also clear that the federal government can help leverage
these strengths to boost our local economy.
That is why today I've released a plan called the Olympic Peninsula
Economic Development Initiative
that outlines ways in which we can
advance policies that will help spur economic growth, strengthen the
long-term viability of key industries, and protect our precious natural
resources for future generations.
The plan includes proposals focused on:
Growing opportunities in the timber industry
Bringing jobs back to America - and investing in rural areas in
particular
Enhancing our infrastructure including rural broadband
Protecting our fisheries
Supporting innovation and new market opportunities (including
opportunities in composite manufacturing); and
Promoting competitiveness through lifelong learning.
I hope you'll take a look and tell me what you think. This initiative
doesn't mark the end of the conversation. If you have further
suggestions on how we can get folks back to work and get our economy
humming again, please share your thoughts at
KilmerEconDev@mail.house.gov.
GROWING HIGH TECH OPPORTUNITIES
As a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I've been
active in discussions of American competitiveness. This past week in
committee we had an extraordinary hearing looking at the importance of
providing opportunities for young people to get exposed to Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math Education.
Among the panelists was Hadi Partovi, the co-founder of Code.org.
According to Code. Org, exposure to computer science can lead to some
of the best paying jobs in the world. Unfortunately, there are some
real concerns with the status quo. Hadi testified that by 2020, it is
predicted that there will be 100,000 more computer science jobs than
students. Yet, in 33 of 50 states, computer science doesn't even count
toward high school graduation math or science.
What's more, according to an article in Education Week just this past
week, in 2013 there were 11 states where not a single African American
student took the Advance Placement exam in Computer Science. In 8
states, not a single Latino student took the exam. And no female
students took the exam in two states.
I have 24,002 reasons to care about this. There are currently 24,000
vacant computing jobs in Washington State. And I have two little girls
that will be entering into a workforce that will rely on skilled in
computing.
We need to find ways to expand computer science courses in every state,
especially in underserved areas and get girls excited about computing
at a young age.
This is why I am a cosponsor the Computer Science Education Act which
would take the first step in ensuring this vital area of study can be
incorporated into K-12 academic curriculum.
STATE OF THE DISTRICT TOUR
Over the next week, I will visit every county in our district to meet
with constituents, local business leaders, and various stakeholders. I'm
calling it a "State of the District" tour because I want to listen to
folks to better understand the concerns of my constituents and to get
input on my plans for economic development.
Building a strong and healthy economy in the region begins with
conversation. I'll be holding roundtable discussions on federal
workforce issues, environmental issues, small business issues, and
education issues. I'll also hold meetings with seniors, veterans,
attend Kilmer at Your Company events where I'll be accessible to a
company's workforce, and speak to Rotary Clubs and other organizations.
I'm looking forward to getting input on ways we can grow our economy,
create jobs, and solve problems for folks here at home.
Thanks as always for reading and don't hesitate to reach out of I or my
office can help you in any way.
Sincerely,
Derek

Friend,
This

Congress
did
something
that
is

in
my
short

here
&#8211;
it

that
will

Puget

While
there
is
still
more
work
to
do
and
many
things
this
funding
bill
did
not
address,
I
hope
that
this
is
a
positive
sign
that
Congress
can
put
aside
the
partisanship
and
work
together
to
address
the
many
challenges
our

is
facing.
ANNOUNCING

When

I&#8217;ve

with

just
what
it
will
take
to
get

As

who
was
born

I

we

who
are
laying
the

for

It&#8217;s
also
clear
that
the
federal
government
can
help
leverage
these
strengths
to
boost
our
local
economy.
That
is
why
today
I&#8217;ve
released
a

Initiative
that
outlines
ways
in
which
we
can

of

The
plan
includes
proposals
focused
on: &#183;
Growing

in
the
timber

Bringing

back
to

&#8211;
and

Promoting

I
hope
you&#8217;ll
take
a
look
and
tell
me
what
you
think.
This
initiative
doesn&#8217;t
mark
the
end
of
the
conversation.
If
you

GROWING

OPPORTUNITIES
As
a

of
the
Science,

Committee,
I&#8217;ve
been
active
in
discussions
of
American
competitiveness.

and
Math

Among
the
panelists
was
Hadi
Partovi,
the
co-founder
of
Code.org.
According
to
Code.
Org,
exposure
to
computer
science
can
lead
to
some
of
the
best
paying
jobs
in
the
world.
Unfortunately,
there
are
some
real
concerns
with
the
status

Hadi
testified
that
by
2020,
it
is
predicted
that
there
will
be
100,000
more
computer
science
jobs
than
students.
Yet,
in
33
of
50
states,
computer
science
doesn&#8217;t
even
count

What&#8217;s
more,
according
to
an
article
in
Education

just
this
past
week,
in
2013
there
were
11
states
where
not
a
single
African
American
student
took
the
Advance

exam
in
Computer

In
8
states,
not
a
single
Latino
student
took
the
exam.
And
no
female
students
took
the
exam
in
two
states.
I
have
24,002
reasons
to
care
about
this.
There
are
currently
24,000
vacant
computing
jobs
in
Washington
State.
And
I
have
two
little
girls
that
will
be
entering
into
a
workforce
that
will
rely
on
skilled
in
computing.
We
need
to
find
ways
to
expand
computer
science
courses
in
every
state,
especially
in
underserved
areas
and
get
girls
excited
about
computing
at
a
young
age.
This
is
why
I
am
a
cosponsor
the
Computer

would

the

STATE
OF
THE
DISTRICT
TOUR
Over
the
next
week,
I
will
visit
every
county
in
our
district
to
meet
with
constituents,
local
business
leaders,
and
various
stakeholders.
I&#8217;m
calling
it
a
&#8220;State
of
the
District&#8221;
tour
because
I
want
to
listen
to
folks
to
better
understand
the
concerns
of
my
constituents
and
to
get
input
on
my
plans
for
economic
development.
Building
a
strong
and
healthy
economy
in
the
region
begins
with
conversation.
I&#8217;ll
be
holding
roundtable
discussions
on
federal
workforce
issues,
environmental
issues,
small
business
issues,
and
education
issues.
I&#8217;ll
also
hold
meetings
with
seniors,
veterans,
attend
Kilmer
at
Your
Company
events
where
I&#8217;ll
be
accessible
to
a
company&#8217;s
workforce,
and
speak
to
Rotary
Clubs
and
other
organizations.
I&#8217;m
looking
forward
to
getting
input
on
ways
we
can
grow
our
economy,
create
jobs,
and
solve
problems
for
folks
here
at
home.
Thanks

don&#8217;t

of
I
or
my

can
