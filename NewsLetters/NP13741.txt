Dear Friends,
As we enter the holiday season, we reflect on the many blessings in our life, make memories with our families, and take the time to show our gratitude to others. Unfortunately, many members of our military and veterans will be far away from their loved ones while they are working on their recovery.
That is why I am holding a holiday card drive that will let our troops at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and veterans at the Fresno VA Medical Center know they are in our thoughts and prayers. I encourage you to take a moment to get involved in this effort.
Until December 20th, you can drop off cards at my Fresno and Merced offices that will be delivered to Walter Reed and the Fresno VA.
If you choose to mail cards to our office, please place them in a separate envelope and send to:
Congressman Jim Costa
"Holiday Cards for our Troops"
855 M St, Suite 940
Fresno, CA 93721
Signing a card or sending a note of thankfulness and best wishes from back home is always appreciated. Your holiday greeting could help brighten the day of a local veteran or recovering soldier.
All cards should be unaddressed, signed, and placed in unsealed envelopes . Please also refrain from purchasing or making cards that include glitter as they can aggravate health issues of ill or injured soldiers.
There is no way that we can repay our debt to those who serve and those who have served, but small gestures such as these let them know that our nation deeply appreciates their sacrifices. If you have any questions, please call my Fresno office at 559-495-1620 or my Merced office at 209-384-1620.
I wish you and yours a safe and blessed holiday season. As Americans, we have so much to be thankful for.
Sincerely,
Jim Costa
Member of Congress
