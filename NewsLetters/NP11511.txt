28th
District
Dear Friend,
2 million Americans have
now been cut off from their unemployment insurance
a lifeline
during desperate and trying times
and I have received a
number of letters asking me one simple question: why?
I
wanted to respond as part of my Ask Adam video series.
Daniel,
a West Hollywood resident afraid of losing his unemployment insurance
wrote: Im a Veteran working in the entertainment industry in Los
Angeles, but out of work since June 7th. Because it's been so
long, I have completely exhausted my savings just to get by and now
unemployment insurance is literally the only thing I have to live
on.
Late in 2013, as unemployment benefits for more than a
million workers were set to expire, the House Majority prevented any vote on
extending long-term unemployment insurance to come up in the House
showing a cruelty and indifference to the plight of millions who are
desperately looking for work.
More
than 2.3 million unemployed job-seekers will lose their benefits
in April if Congressional inaction continues. This is not only
irresponsible to these struggling families, but economists have estimated
that the expiration of benefits could also cost our economy an additional
240,000 lost jobs this year.
Congress
must act immediately
there is no excuse. Click below to watch the
