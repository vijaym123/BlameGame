Honoring Public Service
Dear Friend,
Public Service Recognition Week begins this Sunday, and I wanted to
take this opportunity to thank the Pennsylvanians who have answered the
call to serve their fellow citizens, our communities and our nation.
Every day, public employees - both military and civilian - provide
services that sustain and improve our way of life. These dedicated
individuals care for our veterans and seniors, teach our children,
deliver our mail, preserve our natural resources and develop new,
innovative technologies to strengthen our economy, combat disease and
improve our health. At home and abroad, the men and women who serve in
law enforcement and in the military sacrifice so much to protect our
local communities and defend our nation. They all deserve our
appreciation and respect.

Street's soup kitchen in Lansdale, PA.
As a member of Congress, it has been my privilege to work with
talented, dedicated people who are committed to strengthening the
Commonwealth and improving the lives of their fellow Pennsylvanians.
This includes the wonderful team that serves the constituents of the
13th Congressional District from my offices in Northeast Philadelphia
and Abington.
Each year my district offices help thousands of individuals, families
and businesses with matters related to federal agencies, such as Social
Security, Medicare, passports and veterans services. Over the past nine
years, my office has successfully assisted more than 16,500
constituents, including:
*	1,800 veterans with U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
benefits.
*	1,700 seniors and disabled constituents with Social Security.
*	1,200 individuals with IRS issues.
*	1,000 seniors with Medicare cases.
*	800 constituents with issues concerning passports.
*	500 individuals with U.S Postal Service issues.
Please join me in thanking our region's public servants as we mark
Public Service Recognition Week.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress
