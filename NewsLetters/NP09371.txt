The
Arlington National Cemetery
was established 150 years ago to serve as a final resting place for Civil War soldiers.
It now honors military heroes from every war.
Throughout our more than 237-year history, countless men and women have selflessly answered the call of duty to preserve liberty by serving in our military. Now each day we wake up in a country with freedoms that are coveted, studied and admired across the world. There is no nation greater than the United States of Americaa status maintained because of the extraordinary service of those who volunteered to protect our nation.
True patriotism is embodied in the lives of our military and their families. Their bravery and courage is truly unmatched and must never be taken for granted. It is because of those who are ready and willing to serve and sacrifice for the common good that we continue to be the greatest nation on earth.
While weve been celebrating military service all month long, Memorial Day marks a special time of remembering and honoring those who offered their last full measure of devotion to our nation, an extraordinary act of sacrifice, loyalty and patriotism. President Thomas Jefferson once said, The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. For our fallen heroes, those words are still not empty, a reminder that their service was not in vain.
Please join me this Memorial Day in celebrating and remembering the lives of our dedicated military heroes past and present. To them do generations owe the greatest and most sincere gratitude.
Sincerely,
Tom Cole
