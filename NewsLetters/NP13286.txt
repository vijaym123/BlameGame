Friends,
I hope you and your family had a safe and exciting beginning to 2014.
Today, I returned to Washington to start the second session of the 113th Congress.
Before I returned, many of you completed a poll about the Seventh Districts legislative priorities for this year.
I have included the poll at the bottom of the newsletter but wanted to expand on the
leading priority from our District's poll: job creation and economic growth.
This issue has been my focus and will remain my focus throughout the 113th Congress.
Given our economic situation, I believe getting people back to work should be every Representatives first priority.
The Seventh District has counties with some of the highest unemployment in the state and I, along with local leaders, pledge to continue to move our district forward.
I spent last weekend in our district with a
West Coast manufacturer looking to relocate
to the East Coast.
I am excited to tell you that he left our District impressed with what we have to offer.
This weekend Governor Haley announced that
40,000 jobs have been brought back to South Carolina
since 2010.
South Carolina has become one of the most business friendly states in our country and an example of economic competitiveness.
This attitude has led to job creation and renewed growth.
If we can apply this attitude nationally, our country will see more jobs coming back to our shores .
We still have plenty of work to do.
I will continue to work every dayin Washington and in the Seventh Districtto attract more jobs and make our country, and community, more competitive.
It is my great honor to serve you.
If you or your family needs help with a federal agency, filing a claim with the VA, or obtaining a passport, please contact one of my District Offices.
Are you planning a trip to Washington this year? If so, please stop by my Washington Office.
Give us a call in advance so we can arrange a tour of the Capitol or White House.
My Washington Office can also request to have flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a special occasion.
For more information on any of these services, please give us a call.
Have a good week,
