David -- Republicans are going all in to GUT Social Security. Here&rsquo;s the latest:
FIRST:
Jeb Bush said he wants to raise the retirement age to 70.
THEN:
He announced a proposal to privatize Social Security.
We can&rsquo;t let Bush and the Republicans put Social Security on the chopping block.
TELL REPUBLICANS:
Don&rsquo;t rob Social Security from millions &gt;&gt;
SIGN YOUR NAME &gt;&gt;
Millions of Illinois seniors depend on Social Security to retire with dignity.
So while Jeb Bush is trying to take away the safety net for our seniors, Cheri continues to make protecting Social Security one of her top priorities in Congress.
But if we&rsquo;re going to force Republicans to drop their plans to end this critical program as we know it, it&rsquo;s absolutely critical we show our grassroots strength. Will you sign our petition demanding Republicans back off their plan to gut Social Security? http://act.cheribustos.com/Defend-Social-Security
