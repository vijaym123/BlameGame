Opening Statement
The
Hill: GOP, Dems Blast Obama on Arctic
Drilling
By Timothy Cama
The Obama administration got heavy criticism from both the right and
the left Tuesday on its policies toward oil and natural gas drilling
in the Arctic
Ocean.
In a House hearing on Arctic drilling, Republicans
accused President Obama of trying to stifle development with unattainable
rules and restrictions, while Democrats said he is going out of his
way to allow unsafe
exploration.
The Interior Departments regulations
proposed earlier this year for offshore drilling in the Arctic were a main
focus of the hearing, along with a report from the industry-backed
National Petroleum Council that called for more Arctic
drilling.
We have an Arctic rule published by the
Department of the Interior
largely prescriptive in nature
that
could significantly slow exploration and development and possibly curtail
industry interest in future offshore lease sales that are currently
scheduled, Rep. Doug Lamborn, chairman of the House Natural Resources
subcommittee with jurisdiction over offshore drilling, said at the
hearing.
The rule, which was
published just weeks before the final release of the NPC study, does
not take into account many of the well thought out conclusions of the
study
the most striking being that most of the U.S. Arctic offshore
oil and gas potential could be developed today using existing, field
proven technology, he
continued.
The controversial rule includes
requirements such as that a driller have a drilling rig in the Arctic
ready to make a relief will in the case of a blowout. It also restricts
the drilling season to avoid ice and requires Arctic-specific
plans.
Rep.
Don Young (R-Alaska) accused the administration of hysteria with its
Arctic rules.
The problem I have is, I believe the administration has a
mother may I approach. I dont think that really will work, he
said.
Young asked Brian Salerno, director of Interiors Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement, if he had considered the low pressure in the
Arctic Ocean when developing the rule, since the risk of well blowouts
is lower.
Ive heard the word blowout, blowout, blowout, he said. It
will not happen at that
pressure.
We do agree that the risk is low,
Salerno responded. But its not
zero.
While Democrats welcomed the rule,
they criticized the approval last month of Royal Dutch Shells
exploratory drilling permit, less than three years after its last error-prone
attempt.
They also criticized drillers who said the rules are too
strict.
The
majority points out that there are so-called barriers to development in
the Arctic, said Rep. Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on
the panel.
But I dont see it. Instead, it seems to me that the
administration is supporting Arctic development, and I think thats a
mistake.
He
said the United States should set an international example and
declare that the Arctic is too fragile for
drilling.
But unfortunately, the
administration continues to move forward with the plans to allow
additional onshore and offshore drilling in the Arctic, he said. The oil and
gas industry should be exceptionally grateful for this opportunity
that theyre being given, that even after Shells failure of three years
ago, they are being given the chance to try to drill
again.
Salerno
focused mostly on the proposed rules, and said that they are reasonable,
given the particular weather, remoteness and other concerns in the
Arctic.
The proposed rule is intended to provide the clarity needed to pursue
these resources safely, he
said.
In our view, these requirements are
necessary to provide the assurance that drilling can be managed safely,
and that emergencies can be effectively
addressed.
While Shell will not
be subject to the rules for its planned drilling this summer, the
Interior Department has put similar requirements on Shells drilling
approval.
