This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined Family Research Council

recent
legislative changes he was able to make leading the Air Force to
more clearly reflect the priority of religious freedom in their
regulations.

Background

The revised

The Lamborn amendment was added to the FY2015 National
Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4435) during debate on the House floor
in May of this year. The amendment, section 528, requires the Air
Force to revise Air Force Instruction (AFI) 1-1. The previous version of
AFI 1-1 included language restricting the religious expression of
Airmen.
2.11.
Free Exercise of Religion and Religious Accommodation. Every Airman is
free to
practice the
religion of their choice or subscribe to no religious belief at all. You
should
confidently
practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ
from your
own. Every Airman
also has the right to individual expressions of sincerely held
beliefs, to AFI1-1 7 AUGUST 2012 19
include conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs, unless
those expressions would have an
adverse impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, good order,
discipline, health and safety, or
mission accomplishment.
2.11.1. Your right to practice your religious beliefs does not
excuse you from complying
with directives, instructions and lawful orders; however, you may
request religious
accommodation. Commanders and supervisors at all levels must fairly consider
requests for
religious
accommodation. Airmen requesting accommodation will continue to comply
with
directives, instructions and
lawful orders from which they are requesting
accommodation
unless and until the request is
approved.
2.11.2. If it is
necessary to deny free exercise of religion or an accommodation request,
the
decision must be based
on the facts presented, must directly relate to the
compelling
government interest of military
readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health
and
safety, or mission
accomplishment, and must be by the least restrictive means necessary
to
avoid the cited adverse
impact.
2.12. Balance of Free Exercise of
Religion and Establishment Clause. Leaders at all
levels
must balance constitutional
protections for their own free exercise of religion,
including
individual expressions of religious
beliefs, and the constitutional prohibition
against
governmental establishment of religion. They
must ensure their words and actions
cannot
reasonably be construed to be officially endorsing
or disapproving of, or extending
preferential
treatment for any faith, belief, or absence of
belief.
