News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
First off, I want to wish all of the veterans out there a very happy
Veterans Day. As many of you know, our district is home to more than
100,000 veterans and that makes today a very special day in our area.
If you see a veteran today, please let them know we're thinking about
them and we appreciate everything they have done for this country.
Along those lines, later this afternoon I'm going to be participating
in a celebration for Operation Shoebox. They are celebrating Veterans
Day generally, but today they are celebrating having sent their 1
millionth care package to troops overseas.
The project was started a decade ago by Mrs. Mary Harper, a dedicated
military mom. To make a long story short, Mrs. Harper knew how
important care packages were to her own sons serving abroad and set
about sending packages to other troops. What started out in her kitchen
grew over the years into a full-scale international operation that has
touched the lives of countless service members.
It's things like that that make the biggest difference to our troops.
They are an all-volunteer force and knowing that their fellow
countrymen support them and appreciate their sacrifice means a great
deal.
It is also the responsibility of our government to ensure that when our
troops come home that they have the resources and support they have
earned. One thing I've been working on with Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH)
is a bill to improve the way that DOD and the VA respond to medical
issues that are largely specific to veterans. Traumatic Brain Injuries
and other medical challenges affect large numbers of returning
veterans. It's important that the full weight of our resources are
brought to bear is treating these injuries. Right now, duplication and
inefficiency is preventing us from achieving that. Congressman Ryan and
I are preparing to introduce legislation in the coming days which will
help address that.
As partisan as Washington can be at times, there are definitely issues
that we can all come together around. Helping to heal our nation's
warriors is certainly one of those things.
As we pause today to recognize America's veterans, please remember all
of those young people who are still out there in harm's way doing what
they can to protect us and to protect each other.
And as always, just know that if there is ever anything my staff or I
can do, it is an honor to serve those who have served us.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
First
off,
I
want
to
wish
all
of
the
veterans
out
there
a
very
happy
Veterans
Day.
As
many
of
you
know,
our
district
is
home
to
more
than
100,000
veterans
and
that
makes
today
a
very
special
day
in
our
area.
If
you
see
a
veteran
today,
please
let
them
know
we&#8217;re
thinking
about
them
and
we
appreciate
everything
they
have
done
for
this
country.
Along
those
lines,
later
this
afternoon
I&#8217;m
going
to
be
participating
in
a
celebration
for
Operation
Shoebox.
They
are
celebrating
Veterans
Day
generally,
but
today
they
are
celebrating
having
sent
their
1
millionth
care
package
to
troops
overseas.
The
project
was
started
a
decade
ago
by
Mrs.
Mary
Harper,
a
dedicated
military
mom.
To
make
a
long
story
short,
Mrs.
Harper
knew
how
important
care
packages
were
to
her
own
sons
serving
abroad
and
set
about
sending
packages
to
other
troops.
What
started
out
in
her
kitchen
grew
over
the
years
into
a
full-scale
international
operation
that
has
touched
the
lives
of
countless
service
members.
It&#8217;s
things
like
that
that
make
the
biggest
difference
to
our
troops.
They
are
an
all-volunteer
force
and
knowing
that
their
fellow
countrymen
support
them
and
appreciate
their
sacrifice
means
a
great
deal.
It
is
also
the
responsibility
of
our
government
to
ensure
that
when
our
troops
come
home
that
they
have
the
resources
and
support
they
have
earned.
One
thing
I&#8217;ve
been
working
on
with
Congressman
Tim
Ryan
(D-OH)
is
a
bill
to
improve
the
way
that
DOD
and
the
VA
respond
to
medical
issues
that
are
largely
specific
to
veterans.
Traumatic
Brain
Injuries
and
other
medical
challenges
affect
large
numbers
of
returning
veterans.
It&#8217;s
important
that
the
full
weight
of
our
resources
are
brought
to
bear
is
treating
these
injuries.
Right
now,
duplication
and
inefficiency
is
preventing
us
from
achieving
that.
Congressman
Ryan
and
I
are
preparing
to
introduce
legislation
in
the
coming
days
which
will
help
address
that.
As
partisan
as
Washington
can
be
at
times,
there
are
definitely
issues
that
we
can
all
come
together
around.
Helping
to
heal
our
nation&#8217;s
warriors
is
certainly
one
of
those
things.
As
we
pause
today
to
recognize
America&#8217;s
veterans,
please
remember
all
of
those
young
people
who
are
still
out
there
in
harm&#8217;s
way
doing
what
they
can
to
protect
us
and
to
protect
each
other.
And
as
always,
just
know
that
if
there
is
ever
anything
my
staff
or
I
can
do,
it
is
an
honor
to
serve
those
who
have
served
us.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
