Dear
Friends,
Yesterday, Secretary of State John Kerry appeared
before the Foreign Affairs Committee where I serve and it was
disappointing that in his written statement he failed to mention the ongoing,
over one month long crisis in Venezuela. The Administration is
condemning Nicolas Maduros use of force against the peaceful protesters in
Venezuela, but voicing a concern is not enough.
One of the
opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez, was unjustly arrested and has been
imprisoned, isolated in a military jail now for 24 days as Maduro attempts
to silence dissent in Venezuela. Three more people died this week as
a result of Maduros violent suppression, bringing the sad tally to
two dozen dead since protests began.
President Obama issued an
executive order that would impose sanctions against Russian officials
responsible for human rights abuses, and Ive written to the President
asking that he do the same for Venezuela.
Maduro continues
to get help from the Castro regime while it has been sending Cuban
troops to crackdown on the Venezuelan protesters. I hope the President
holds these violators in Venezuela responsible and sanction individual
human rights abusers in Venezuela.
And continuing with the
theme of accountability, I have doubts that accountability and oversight
over the Palestinian Authority finances are actually taking
place.
Abu Mazen repeatedly reaffirms his refusal and unwillingness to
recognize Israel as a Jewish State, he continues to pay
nearly $50
million dollars a year now
the salaries of Palestinians who were
imprisoned in Israeli jails, many of whom have blood on their hands. In
fact, dozens of rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza this week. So
this serves as a grim reminder that Israel continues to be under
attack.
And in the West Bank, hundreds of millions of taxpayer
dollars continue to flow to the Palestinian Authority (PA)
wishing and
hoping and praying that they do theyll do the right thing. Something
must be done to ensure that the PA recognizes and accepts Israel as a
Jewish State. Money is fungible, so one could say that U.S. taxpayer
dollars are being used to pay the salaries of these
terrorists.
The Administration is still seeking a waiver authority to fund
agencies at the United Nations that admit a non-existent Palestinian State.
Abu Mazen has repeatedly reaffirmed that, if the peace process fails to
produce an agreement, the Palestinians will make a full out push at
the UN to get statehood.
Secretary Kerry said that withholding
our money wont deter Abu Mazen, but I say that it very clearly could
deter UN agencies so we cannot allow this waiver authority to
undermine the peace process.
Let's work together to re-affirm
America's exceptional role as the model of democracy, freedom, the rule of
law and human rights.
Sincerely,
Ileana
