After 17 years of patching the old
inner tube, on March 26th the House did the right thing and put on a new
tire. We said enough is enough on such an important issue for our
seniors and passed a permanent fix to Medicares Sustainable Growth Rate
(SGR), known as the doc fix.
The House passed legislation to
permanently repeal this flawed formula and replace it with a plan that
strengthens Medicare, providing our seniors with better
care.
The SGR was enacted in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act and
has been a chronic source of concern for physicians who serve
seniors.
Consistently recognized as an imperfect solution rewarding
quantity of services over quality of care, Congress has repeatedly
implemented a temporary doc fix to prevent substantial Medicare
reimbursement rate cuts, which could result in fewer physicians serving Medicare
patients.
By an overwhelming vote of 392 to 37, the
House passed a permanent solution to fixing the flawed SGR.
The
legislation establishes the first real structural reform to Medicare in
nearly two decades without increasing taxes.
I urge the
Senate to pass this legislation so Congress can once-and-for-all be done
with the short-term fixes to the SGR.
I hope this legislation
can serve as a model for future legislative efforts to reform our
nations programs without increasing the tax burden on
Americans.
