Last month President Obama announced his
support for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the
Internet as a public utility. Let me repeat that - the president wants
to regulate the Internet.
The Internet is a system of
private and public networks created by many different individuals and
organizations.
These networks are paid for in a variety of
different ways, and most are private property.
I believe that those
who own and maintain those systems should stipulate how their property
is used, and since net neutrality or anything resembling it conflicts
with this principle, I cannot support it.
How carriers manage
their networks and negotiate arrangements should be determined by
engineers, entrepreneurs and consumers acting in the vigorous marketplace,
not by the subjective judgments of unelected
bureaucrats.
The Internet is one of the most exciting and promising inventions we
have created.
It has immense potential to transform human
civilization and accelerate scientific progress.
We do not need more
heavy-handed intervention from government bureaucrats who have a limited
understanding at best as to what the Internet should become, what
services it should provide, or how those services should be delivered to
the public.
If the FCC regulates the Internet as a
public utility it will diminish investment and hinder opportunity for
commercial activities.
In our sluggish economy one of the bright
spots has been investment and innovation on the Internet.
According
to a recent study released by the Progressive Policy Institute, the
presidents support for regulating the Internet like a utility amounts
to a $17 billion tax on Americans.
We need a
hands-off approach to regulating the Internet.
An Internet free
from government intrusion is a vital ingredient to a growing economy.
One more thing - did I mention the president wants to regulate the
Internet - let that sink in.
