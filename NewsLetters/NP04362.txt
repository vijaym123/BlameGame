But Thanksgiving is more than eating, Chuck. You heard what Linus was saying out there. Those early Pilgrims were thankful for what had happened to them, and we should be thankful, too. We should just be thankful for being together. I think thats what they mean by Thanksgiving, Charlie Brown.
Marcie
That famous quote from the movie A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is a light hearted way to remind young and old about the importance of Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is not only a day to celebrate with loved ones but also a reminder for all of our good fortunes.
As the story goes, in 1621, the first Thanksgiving was shared among the Plymouth colonists and the Wampanoag Tribe. The colonists had to endure the voyage which left many sick and facing starvation. Then, after persevering through a harsh winter and with the help of the Native Americans, the two groups came together and celebrated a feast. The colonists and the Wampanoags were able to put aside their hardships and differences and enjoy the day together.
During this time of year, I like to share the story of the very first Thanksgiving, and the act of kindness, with my grandchildren so they know the history and meaning behind this holiday
and remind them to whom we are giving thanks.
While our great nation has faced much adversity of its own, I am always humbled when I hear and read stories about strangers lending a helping hand to someone less fortunate. Whether it might be donating canned goods to a local shelter or spending a Saturday morning volunteering, there are many ways to give back. This spirit of Thanksgiving and sharing has always been part of the American character.
So, whether its gathering your family and loved ones around the television to watch A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving or if you have a family tradition of going outside to toss the pigskin, or making creative dishes from the leftover turkey and stuffing
remember all of the blessings you have to be grateful this holiday season.
On behalf of myself, my family, and my staff, I want to wish you all a very Happy Thanksgiving.
