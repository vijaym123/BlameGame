Friends,
Congress just wrapped up its
first legislative week of the New Year.
It was a productive week, but a cold one. I hope you were able to stay warm during the polar vortex. Surprisingly, it was nearly the same temperature in Florence as it was in Washington.
I am pleased to report that
my
Stop This Overreaching Presidency (STOP) Resolution has really started to pick up steam.
This resolution, H. Res. 442, directs the House to file suit against the President for not enforcing our countrys laws. STOP started out with only a handful of cosponsors. When Congress recessed for Christmas, it had 27 cosponsors and when Congress reconvened on Tuesday, the resolution had 34 cosponsors. Today, I am proud to say the
STOP Resolution has over 50 cosponsors and nearly 100 citizen cosponsors.
I have seen a great deal of interest in STOP but
still need your help spreading the word.

to learn more about STOP and how you can help this effort. Our Founding Fathers created a government of the people, by the people, for the people. As such, they provided us with a Constitution to protect our democracy. We cannot stand by and watch our Constitution and our laws be ignored.
Together, we will ensure that our nations laws are upheld.
Honoring a Seventh District Hero
WWII veteran, Billy Thomas
was honored for his service to our country last week during a ceremony at Belin United Methodist Church in Murrells Inlet. Mr. Thomas is 85-years-old and graduated from the Citadel in 1945. At the ceremony,
Mr. Thomas was presented with the WWII Victory Medal.
I was humbled to learn about Mr. Thomas brave service to our country.
Heroes, like Mr. Thomas, are one in a million
and we must never forget the sacrifices our veterans and their families made for our country.
Thank you, Mr. Thomas. We salute you.

Seventh District Family Needs Your Help
Wrenzie and I are deeply saddened by a young constituents disappearance.
Heather Elvis, a 20-year-old from Myrtle Beach, has been missing for nearly a month.
As a father of three boys and a father-in-law, my thoughts and prayers go out to the Elvis family during their continued search for their daughter.
If you have any information or would like to volunteer in the search efforts, you can call the Horry County Police Department at (843) 915-5350 or (843) 915-TIPS (8477).
It is an honor and privilege to serve you.
Have a good week,
