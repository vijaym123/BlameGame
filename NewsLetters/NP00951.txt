Small Business Owners: Key to a Healthy and Growing
Economy
This week is Small Business Week, and with good
reason. Consider these facts:
There are an estimated
28 million
small businesses in the United States and
they employ half of Americas workforce! Generally a small business is
defined as any enterprise with fewer than 500 workers. And there are
many of these companies as nearly 98 percent of all U.S. employers fall
into this category.
Small business is absolutely
critical to a growing and healthy economy as they create nearly seven out
of ten new jobs. In this regard, its very important that we allow
them to grow by reducing needless regulation and keeping their tax
burden as low as possible.
In this regard, the Administration
does not appear to be doing too well.
Last year, the U.S. ranked
46th in ease of starting a business according to a World Bank report.
In 2007, it ranked 3rd.
In fact, since 2008, more small
businesses have closed than have opened. This is the first time business
casualties have exceeded business births since data has been recorded
on the issue.
The last thing a small business needs is
uncertainty from their government, changes in the tax code, or excessive
regulation.
In this new Congress, we have passed several key
bills to boost small businesses in the first 100 days
alone.
We passed the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility
Improvements Act (H.R. 527) to scale back the regulatory red tape that
burdens Main Street so that small businesses are free to
grow.
We passed the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small
Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37), which cuts excess regulation so
that small businesses have access to the capital they need to grow and create
good-paying jobs.
We passed the Small
Business Tax Relief Act (H.R. 636) that helps to reduce uncertainty from
government so that small businesses can invest in their
future and grow.
We passed the Save the American Workers
Act (H.R. 30), which restores the 40-hour work week that Obamacares
employer mandate destroyed so that small businesses can hire more
workers at the hours that work for them.
We
passed the Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22) to exempt veterans from
Obamacares employer mandate threshold if they already have health care through
TRICARE or the VA so that no employers are penalized for hiring a
veteran and that no veteran is left jobless because of the
mandate.
We repealed the unfair death tax (H.R. 1105) to reform
our tax system so that small businesses can be kept in the family,
even when a loved one dies.
Now, if we can get the
Senate to pass these bills and have the President sign them, well be
boosting small businesses, a key to a growing and healthy
economy.

ER Visits on the Rise under
Obamacare
Of course, one of the most significant
recent drags on job creation among small and large businesses has been
the complicated implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or
Obamacare.
The President says his law is working "better than
expected," even as premiums and deductibles rise, the website remains a
mess, and workers across America have had their hours and wages
slashed.
This week, a new report indicates that patient visits to
the emergency room have surged since Obamacare took effect
just the
opposite of what many Americans had been told would happen.
A
poll released Monday by the American College of Emergency Physicians
shows that 28% of 2,099 doctors surveyed nationally saw large
increases in volume, while 47% saw slight increases. By contrast, fewer than
half of doctors reported any increases last year in the early days of
the Affordable Care Act.

Holding the Obama Administration Accountable for Iran Nuclear
Deal
Next week, the House is expected to vote on legislation
allowing Congress to review a nuclear arms deal with Iran.
The
Senate approved the bipartisan bill yesterday by a vote of
98-1.
The measure would require a competed deal with Iran to be
submitted to Congress, which could then vote to approve or disapprove the
nuclear deal within 30 days. Sanctions on Iran could not be lifted
during this consideration.
While I am pleased that the House
will have the opportunity to hold the Obama Administration accountable
for the contents of any Iran deal it negotiates, I regret that this bill
is not stronger.
After all, a Congressional vote to disapprove
a nuclear deal with Iran would not kill it. President Obama could veto
such a measure, and the House and Senate would then need two-thirds
majorities to override his veto.

Salute: The Men and Women of
Picatinny Arsenal
For the first time in more than a
decade, Picatinny Arsenal opened its gates to the public Monday,
showcasing all they do on the base.
"I think it is important the
local community understands what we do here," Brig. Gen. Patrick Burden
said. "Many people pass the gates and wonder what's inside. Every now
and then we get someone that will come up and ask, or someone
accidentally turns in off of Route 15 and we have to turn them away. This is
an opportunity to let folks see our mission."
