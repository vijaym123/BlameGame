The Patient Choice, Affordability,
Responsibility, and Empowerment (CARE)
Act
A Proposal to Lower Health Care Costs,
Increase Access to Affordable, Quality Care
Without Government-Centered Regulations,
Mandates
Dear Friend:
This week, along with Senators Richard Burr
(R-N.C.) and Tom Coburn, M. D. (R-Okla.), I
unveiled the Patient Choice, Affordability,
Responsibility, and Empowerment (CARE) Act to
repeal ObamaCare and replace it with
common-sense, patient-centered reforms to reduce
health care costs and increase access to
affordable, high-quality care. In contrast with
Obamacares government centered mandates
and regulations, our proposal empowers the
American people to make the best health care
choices for themselves and their families.
Obamacare is a disaster. It forces too many
Americans out of the insurance they have, away
from the doctor they trust and, for some, out of
the job they need. With our plan, were
making it possible once again for Americans
not Washington
to make the best
informed health care decisions for themselves if
given the right tools, information, and
opportunities.
After first repealing the Presidents
health law, we take aim at the chief concerns of
the American people - greater economic security
by driving down costs and expanding access to
high-quality care through increased insurance
market competition and reforms. What weve
put forward is sustainable and achievable
and without the tax hikes, mandates, and
budget-busting spending that have made Obamacare
so unpopular with the American people.
The Patient CARE Act provides a legislative
roadmap to fully repeal the Presidents
health care law, and replace the law with
common-sense measures that would:
Establish sustainable,
patient-centered reforms:
o Adopt common-sense consumer protections;
o Create a new protection to help Americans
with pre-existing conditions;
o Empower small business and individuals with
purchasing power;
o Empower states with more tools to help
provide coverage while reducing costs; and
o Expand and strengthen consumer directed
health care.
Modernize Medicaid to provide better
coverage and care to patients:
o Transition to capped allotment to provide
states with predictable funding and flexibility;
and
o Reauthorize Health Opportunity Accounts to
empower Medicaid patients.
Reduce unnecessary defensive medicine
practices and rein in frivolous
lawsuits:
o Medical Malpractice reforms.
Increase health care price
transparency to empower consumers and
patients:
o Requiring basic health care transparency to
inform and empower patients.
Reduce distortions in the tax code
that drive up health care costs:
o Capping the exclusion of an employees
employer-provided health coverage.

proposal to build consensus and introduce the
legislation.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
