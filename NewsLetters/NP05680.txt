Friend
As I travel around the Fourth District, I am always reminded of one thing: while Washington may have lost track of the heart of America, I know the heartbeat of America is strong because I hear it every time I speak with a small business owner, listen to a citizen, or hear a servicemember talk about why they love and choose to serve this country.
Thats because at the heart of this region
and at the heart of America
is our people. And while the people of the Fourth District are as diverse as the landscape of our region, citizens still come together to overcome barriers, rise to challenges, partner across communities, and fight for a strong future for our country. Below is a photo round up of some of the places I have been privileged to visit this week. I hope as you scroll through these photos, you see not only small business owners, employees, citizens, community leaders, and Virginians; more than that, I hope you see a glimpse of what made America great, and what continues to make us great today:
the people.

It was an honor to speak at the grand opening of Sabra Dipping Companys expanded hummus manufacturing plant in Chesterfield. Great to have this energetic and growing company as part of our economy in the 4th District and I enjoyed touring the newly expanded facility -- seeing how the products are made, and meeting with the workers there.

Visited Canon Information Technology Services in Chesapeake to meet the people that provide support to the 32 million customer contacts each year for Canon products sold in the United States including copiers, fax machines, and digital cameras. I appreciated hearing their ideas and perspectives on growing the economy and business in the Hampton Roads region.

It was great seeing friends in Chesterfield for my Seniors Toolkit Seminar, where I spoke about how to keep important financial and personal documents organized, and information safe online. You can download a copy of the Organizational Toolkit, here:
