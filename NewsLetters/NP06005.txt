An Update from
Congress
Congress returned from the August District
Work Period on September 8 with a full plate of items to consider--the
most important of which was to pass a continuing resolution to keep
the government funded past the end of the fiscal year on September 30.
Other issues that came before the House in the past two weeks of
September included a package of bills to spur economic growth and
create jobs and to increase American energy production.
The House
also considered an amendment on whether to authorize the President to
arm and train Syrian rebels to fight against
ISIS.
Keeping the Government Funded -
The
federal fiscal year runs from October 1 - September 30.
While the
House has passed seven appropriations bills to fund individual
departments and programs, the Senate has passed none.
Zero.
Zilch.
Therefore, a continuing resolution was needed to fund
government operations in the meantime.
This is certainly not ideal, but
it seems to be the norm lately.
What we need is long-term
funding that allows Congress to give careful consideration to each
department's funding and what works and what doesn't.
But to prevent
another government shutdown, I supported the continuing resolution that
passed the House on September 17 by a vote of 319 -
108.
Vote to Arm and Train Syrian
Rebels to Fight ISIS -
As part of consideration of
the continuing resolution, the House voted on an amendment offered by
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon (R-CA) that would
give President Obama the authority to train and arm moderate
Syrian rebels to fight against Islamic extremists in ISIS.
There are
still too many unanswered questions about this plan -- such as who
exactly the rebels are that we would be arming -- and in the past when
the U.S. has become involved in similar conflicts, it has been drawn
out and potentially counterproductive to our interests.
That is
why I voted against this amendment, which passed by a vote of 273
-156.
Jobs and
Energy Bills -
The Senate has over 200 bills that
the House has passed but have not seen the light of day on the Senate
floor for consideration.
The House passed two comprehensive
bills, which combine several previously-passed House bills into one.
The first -- H.R. 2, the American Energy Solutions for
Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act -- would increase domestic
energy production and aims to reduce energy prices for American families.
Having supported each of the bills individually in the past, I
voted for this bill.
Similarly, the House has passed several
jobs bills that break down government regulations and would allow the
economy to grow.
These bills were combined together into H.R. 4 -
the Jobs for America Act, and passed the House with my
support.

Supporting Our Troops and Honoring 9/11
Victims
It's important to support our men and women in uniform
each way we can, and that is why each time the United Services
Organization (USO) comes to the U.S. Capitol in Washington and sponsors a care
package event, I make every effort to attend.
On September 10,
I participated in the biannual event
with some
of my staff and put together care packages for our troops.
The
USO has distributed more than 2.3 million care packages to troops around
the world since 2003.
On September
11,
I participated in the third annual 9/11 Blood
Drive
sponsored by the Ahmadiyya Muslims for Life and the American
Red Cross.
I gave blood at the first one in 2011 commemorating
the ten-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and I was happy to
do my part to honor those who died in the attacks and help save
lives.

Train
Blocks Wisconsin Road for Five Hours -- My
Response
You may have seen or
read about the
Canadian National (CN) freight train
that stopped in the
intersection of Highway 175 in Fond du Lac County, near the Town of Byron.
There may be more than one reason for this, but one that is cited
is that the train's operators maxed out on their hours-of-service
requirements and could not move the train the 50 feet it needed to move so
that it would not block the intersection.
50
feet!
That is unbelievable and unacceptable.
I raised the issue
at a House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee markup of a passenger rail bill,
and
introduced legislation the next day
to
provide flexibility for train operators in their hours-of-service
requirements so that they would be able to move a train to keep it from
blocking a road.
My staff and I have also met with Canadian National
railroad representatives to express my displeasure and discuss what
options they are taking themselves to prevent this from happening in the
future.
I certainly understand there are many issues that may
have caused this to happen, but my bill will prevent federal
hours-of-service rules from being the reason.
