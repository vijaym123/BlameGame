Congressman Lamborn Supports Call For
Ebola Travel Ban
10/16/14
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn issued the following statement supporting a travel ban as a
result of the Ebola outbreak.
The Ebola humanitarian crisis unfolding in Africa is
heartbreaking and cause for grave concern. However, the first priority of the
President must be doing everything in his power to protect the
citizens of the United States. Thats why President Obama should implement a
temporary civilian travel ban by revoking all visas for the countries
currently struggling with Ebola, while keeping carefully monitored and
quarantined travel avenues open for healthcare professional and
others helping to battle the disease. There are likely to be significant
business, economic, and psychological impacts if the American people
continue to lose confidence in the safety and security of our airline
travel system.
