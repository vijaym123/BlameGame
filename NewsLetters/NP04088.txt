73 years ago on this day, approximately 2,000 Americans were killed and over 1,000 injured in the horrific attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
We will never forget that day. We will never forget the loss of those lives
the loss suffered by the heartbroken families, and the loss suffered by our nation as it missed the good that these patriotic, duty-driven servicemembers would have brought to our country. No matter how many years pass by, we will always remember and we will always be grateful for those who fought to protect our country, sacrificing so much that we might be here today.
This weekend, take a moment to pause and pay tribute to those who dedicate their lives to serving our country. Let us remember Pearl Harbor.
Yours in Service,
Randy
P.S.
If you have worn our nations uniform, or have a family member who has served, I want to say a special thank you. Our country can never repay you for your service or sacrifice. We cannot repay you for the months spent far from home and far from loved ones, for the time and energy invested in protecting this nation. But we are grateful. And we will never forget. Fighting for you in Congress is not just a duty, it is a privilege.
