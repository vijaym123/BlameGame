Friends,
I hope this e-newsletter finds you well.

from Washington and at home with you.

Thank You to the Greatest Generation
?Last Friday marked the 70th anniversary of D-Day, the largest marine
and air invasion in history. We can never repay the Greatest Generation
for all they have done to keep America safe and free. Thank you for
your courage and sacrifice, and for your strength to step off those
boats and jump out of those airplanes 70 years ago today.
You are
appreciated.
Working for Our Veterans?
Those who choose to put on our uniform and serve our country deserve
the very best medical care that we can give them.
The recent
revelations of secret waiting lists and veterans dying for lack of
doctor's appointments are absolutely shameful.
If you or a loved one has been affected by this failure, we want to
help.
My state staff and I met with veterans across the state today to
hear their stories and to work towards resolving their issues. You can
read about our meetings here
.
If you were not able to come to our listening sessions today and need
help with the VA or any other federal agency, please contact my office
here.
Protecting Americans Abroad
I continue to have serious concerns about the Administration's
unilateral release of five high-ranking Taliban leaders. Frankly,
allowing these terrorists back into the theater of war puts more
Americans at risk and puts a price on our troops around the world.
Beyond that, I'm concerned the White House did not notify Congress as
the law requires, something this Administration seems to continue to
forget.
I am honored to serve as your voice in the United States Senate, and
appreciate hearing your thoughts, questions, and concerns.
Please do
not hesitate to reach out to my office if we can ever be of service to
you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
