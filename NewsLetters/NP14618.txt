Dear Friends,
Congress is
not in session this week, so I'm traveling West Virginia to discuss our
state's energy future and honor our veterans as we approach Veterans
Day.
On Wednesday, I toured WVA Manufacturing/Globe
Specialty Metals in Alloy, a longtime employer in Fayette
County.
On Thursday, I spoke at the dedication
of the new Interstate 77-Route 2 bridge in Parkersburg in honor of
Chief Petty Officer Andrew Scott Mollohan, who passed away in 2009 after
more than 20 years of service in the U.S. Navy. I commend the efforts
of his father, Thomas Mollohan, to raise awareness of post-traumatic
stress disorder. This Veterans Day, we must do more to protect those who
have given so much for our nation.
Later that day, I visited Huntington to speak to
veterans at CSX, where I was privileged to meet with so many wonderful
veterans. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I heard firsthand
the sacrifices and efforts our veterans have made to serve our
country, and I thank all veterans in West Virginia for their
service.
And on Friday, I spoke
to students at Bridgeview Elementary School in South Charleston about
the significance of Veterans Day. I hope everyone will take time to
thank a veteran for his or her dedication to our nation and its
principles.
