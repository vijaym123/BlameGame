Dear Friends,
Last week I joined Congressman Joe Courtney to speak with UCONN students on college affordability and student debt (pictured below). As both the
UCONN Daily Campus
and
CT News Junkie
point out, several students spoke on the immediate need for Congress to deal with the rising costs of higher education and the massive burden of student debt.
In fact, there is about $1.2 trillion worth of student loan debt owed by about 40 million individual borrowers in the United States right now. Costs of college continue to go up while the total amount of student loan debt now exceeds total credit card debt nationwide.
With several measures before Congress to deal with this rising national issue, it&rsquo;s crucial that students have several opportunities to have their voices heard and discuss college affordability with their Representatives.
That&rsquo;s why I will continue to host Student Forums on College Affordability across the First Congressional District and invite all local students to attend the following upcoming forum:
CCSU Student Forum on College Affordability
With Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty
Thursday, February 19th, 5PM-6PM
Central Connecticut State University, Student Center, Bellin Gallery
1615 Stanley Street, New Britain, CT

Students will have an opportunity to share their views throughout the forum. Refreshments will be provided for those who attend. I look forward to hearing from you and continuing this discussion over the next several months.
Sincerely,
