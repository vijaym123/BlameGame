Kansas Common Sense
March 31, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
For More and Better Jobs Look to Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship is crucial to the health of the greater economy and
its role in federal deficit reduction. I am a vocal supporter of
innovation because the success of entrepreneurs helps the society at
large through the production of better products and services at lower
prices, while creating jobs and sparking the engine of economic growth.
The power of growth to cut the deficit is profound: Increased economic
growth rates of just 0.1 percent per year for 25 years would add more
than $1 trillion in deficit-cutting revenue. Just imagine the impact of
significant and sustained growth; it has happened before in America
and, with the right pro-growth policies in place, it can happen again.
Kansas has a rich history of entrepreneurship and has shaped the nature
of our state and its economy. Click here
to read my recent editorial on this issue.
Lesser Prairie Chicken Listed as Threatened Species
This week, we received word from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services
Director Dan Ashe that the lesser prairie chicken will be listed as a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. This is not
welcome news because listing the lesser prairie chicken will have real
consequences on many sectors in communities across Kansas including
agriculture, oil and gas development, ranching, transportation and wind
energy.
I am confident there are ways to address conserving the species while
not hampering economic growth and farming and ranching activities. As
conservation efforts are considered, producers deserve the flexibility
to implement plans that fit their operations. Additionally, it will be
imperative to account for ongoing species recovery developments. I am
committed to working with U.S. Fish and Wildlife to make certain the
measures implemented are based on sound science and common sense, as
well as represent the best interest of producers. Click here

Senate Hearings on Challenges Facing Rural America
Questioning FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioner Ajit Pai on FCC
Budget Priorities
On Thursday, the Financial Services and General Government
Appropriations Subcommittee met with the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to discuss their FY2015 budget request. This year's
FCC budget request asks for additional money for technology upgrades to
make the agency more efficient and additional staff to enhance
enforcement of the E-Rate and Lifeline programs that have shown signs
of waste, fraud and abuse. During the hearing, I had an opportunity to
question FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioner Ajit Pai about rural
broadband, the future of Universal Service and the Connect America
Fund, and the upcoming broadcaster incentive auction, which will make
new airwaves available for mobile broadband services. Access to
affordable broadband is critical for every Kansas community. I will
continue to work with my colleagues to ensure the FCC not only uses
their funds wisely to achieve the goals set out by Congress, but also
makes common sense policy decisions that increase access to broadband
and next generation communications. Click here
to watch
excerpts from the hearing.
Questioning Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Farm
Bill Implementation
As a member of the Subcommittee for Agriculture Appropriations, I had
the opportunity to question U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Secretary Tom Vilsack this week. We primarily discussed implementation
of the Farm Bill, and I asked him to provide a timeline so producers
know when the new farm programs will be up and running.
The first set of programs to be implemented are the Livestock Disaster
Programs, and signups should be available as soon as April 15 with
producer payments being delivered thereafter. Right now, USDA is
working to draft the rules for the commodity and crop insurance
programs, as well as educate Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff and
producers on the new programs. USDA is hopeful that by late summer
producers will have the opportunity to update yields and acres with
their FSA office, and by early fall the final rules for the new
programs will be available. Additionally, signups for farm programs
should available by the end of the year.
I also reminded Secretary Vilsack that one of his primary roles is to
be an advocate for agriculture within the administration. It's
imperative that the issues facing rural America are explained and
understood by an increasingly urban Congress. I will continue to
advocate for agriculture, and implore my colleagues from rural America
to do the same.
Overregulation by the Environmental Protection Agency Continues
Proposed Clean Water Act Rule
This week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposed a new Clean Water Act rule. The
rule would expand their authority of waters regulated by the Clean
Water Act. Unfortunately, the EPA continues to draft and implement
unreasonable rules that increase burdens for farmers and ranchers in
Kansas and across the country. The proposed rule would expand federal
authority to almost all waters in the United States including small
streams and wetlands on private property that dry up during the summer
months. This is yet another example of federal government overreach and
unnecessary intrusion into the lives of Americans, and I encourage
Kansas producers to make their voices heard. Click here
to comment on the proposed rule.
EPA Employment Impact Analysis Act
I also joined Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma this week in introducing
the EPA Employment Impact Analysis Act, a bill to prohibit the EPA from
finalizing any major regulations until the agency analyzes the economic
impact of its current air regulations as required under Section 321(a)
of the Clean Air Act.
Once again, American businesses are being put at a competitive
disadvantage and losing access to world markets because of government
overreach. Our government should not be an adversary when it comes to
the success of a business in the United States. The legislation would
stop the EPA from implementing any more job-killing regulations until
the economic impact of its current regulations are fully known.
Hopefully, businesses in Kansas and across our country may be
optimistic about the future of the American economy. Click here

TRIO Breakfast
On Tuesday, I attended the Kansas TRIO Programs' 20th Annual
Legislative Breakfast. TRIO programs operate in 19 Kansas
post-secondary schools and provide services to students from low-income
and disadvantaged backgrounds, students with disabilities, adult
learners and veterans to support them in achieving their goal of
completing higher education, and often becoming the first in their
family to earn a college degree.
I had the opportunity to meet Kansas TRIO alumni Shanda Burch and
Kimberly Woolf, and hear their inspiring personal stories about
pursuing higher education with the support of TRIO programs. Thank you
to Wichita State's Kaye Monk-Morgan for emceeing the event and for the
Kansas TRIO staffs for hosting the breakfast. As a first-generation
college graduate myself, I am proud of the effectiveness of TRIO
programs at our schools and have seen their success firsthand.
L'Taken Seminar
On Tuesday, four young Kansans from Topeka's Temple Beth Sholom met
with my staff as part of the 2014 L'Taken seminar. Each year, thousands
of Jewish teens from across the nation travel to Washington, D.C., to
learn about issues of social justice and visit with their
representatives to advocate legislative action. This program is a great
way for young people to learn about public policymaking and have a real
opportunity to consider and articulate which issues matter to them and
why. Thanks to Rabbi Debbie Stiel of Temple Beth Sholom for chaperoning
the trip.
Visiting Labette County
Labette Health Visit
On Friday, I traveled to Labette County to visit Labette Health in
Parsons. Labette Health, which has provided health care to families in
southeast Kansas since 1961, is a 99-bed acute, intensive and
rehabilitation care hospital. The hospital provides 24/7 emergency
care, surgical services, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation
services, and laboratory services to name a few. I always appreciate
the opportunity to meet with Kansas hospital administrators, medical
staff, and other providers to gain insight on the unique challenges
they face caring for patients.
During my visit, we discussed Labette Health's initiatives to increase
patient care quality and utilize community resources to enhance health
services in the area. They emphasized the importance of targeted rural
health initiatives, such as Medicare Dependent Hospital designation and
the Low-Volume Hospital adjustment, which support rural hospitals that
work under tight operating margins to care for patients across wide
areas. We also discussed concerns with federal regulations that fail to
account for the reality of delivering health care in Kansas and across
rural America. For example, unreasonable and inflexible physician
supervision rules relating to the provision of outpatient therapeutic
services, which include drug infusions, blood transfusions, wound
debridement, and cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services, are
making it difficult for many hospitals in Kansas and other rural states
to provide these services to patients. The Senate has passed
legislation I introduced, S. 1954, to prevent the federal government
from enforcing these burdensome regulations for Critical Access
Hospitals and other small, rural hospitals in 2014. Another concern we
visited about were Medicare audit regulations that are flawed and cause
serious financial challenges and unnecessary administrative burdens for
Kansas hospitals and other health providers. Reducing fraud, waste and
abuse in Medicare is an extremely important goal that I support,
however the government also must be careful not to overburden providers
to an extent that restricts their ability to care for patients. As
Ranking Member of Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee, I continue
to advocate for reasonable regulatory flexibility for rural hospitals
and other health providers to deliver the care that is essential to
Kansas communities. Thanks to Labette Health CEO Jodi Schmidt for
hosting my visit, and to Kansas Hospital Association President and CEO
Tom Bell for stopping by.
Zetmeir Health Science Facility Ribbon Cutting
While in Parsons, I participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the
new Sonny and Sophia Zetmeir Health Science Facility on the campus of
Labette Community College (LCC). LCC has a major role in educating the
skilled workers necessary for economic growth in southeast Kansas and
throughout our state. LCC has been tremendously successful in educating
the skilled health professionals who will have a positive impact on the
lives of all those in the communities they serve. Access to health care
providers is essential to the survival and success of communities in
Kansas and across the country. The care these providers administer
determines whether individuals can remain in the communities they call
home and whether their children will return to those communities to
raise their families. I appreciate LCC's commitment to providing
high-quality training to the next generation of health professionals
who will contribute to the success of our communities for decades to
come.
Congratulations to LCC students, faculty and alumni on the opening this
new state-of-the-art facility. I extend my thanks to the members of the
Board of Trustees, the Capital Campaign Committee and the LCC
Foundation and Alumni Association for their many years of hard work and
a real team effort on this project. Thanks to all the donors,
especially Sophia Zetmeir and her late husband Sonny, for your
investment in the future of LCC, Parsons and our state. And thank you
to LCC President Dr. George Knox for inviting me to take part in the
day's events.
Kansas Listening Tour Stops in Bourbon and Rooks Counties
Last week, I held a Kansas Listening Tour stops in Bourbon and Rooks
Counties.
Prior to my town hall meeting in Fort Scott, I stopped by the
courthouse to visit with County Commissioners Barbara Albright, Allen
Warren and Harold Coleman and County Clerk Kendell Mason, as well as
made a quick stop at the National Historic Site. I appreciated Fort
Scott area residents who came out to discuss a variety of issues such
as government regulations, banking and the federal budget. Medicare
reimbursements, the Affordable Care Act and concerns with the employer
mandate were also topics of discussion. Thanks to the Karen
Endicott-Coyan and Reta Baker at Mercy Health Systems for hosting my
town hall. Thanks to State Representative Adam Lusker; Bourbon County
Commissioners Barbara Albright, Allen Warren and Harold Coleman; and
Tom Bell with the Kansas Hospital Association for attending.
On Saturday, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour at Barney's in Palco.
About 35 folks from around the area turned out to share concerns and
give feedback on a wide range of topics - from the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's decision to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as a
threatened species, to First Amendment rights and Obamacare. We also
discussed the importance of improving health care for veterans and
tackling the national debt. Thanks again to everyone who attended
including Rooks Co. Commissioner John Ruder. Thanks to Barney's for
hosting the Listening Tour stop.
The issues I focus on and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely
based on the conversations I have with Kansans during these town hall
meetings. Thanks to all the folks who came out and shared a dose of
Kansas common sense. Check my website
for upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops.
Kansas Community Leaders Visit Washington
This week, leaders from several Kansas communities came to Washington
to visit their elected officials. They were also in town to meet with
representatives from federal agencies whose projects and programs
affect their respective communities. We were happy to host
representatives from Dodge City, Garden City, Great Bend, Greensburg,
Hays, Leavenworth and Liberal. Thanks to everyone who made the trip and
stopped by our office.

Common Sense March

Hello,
Welcome

Senate Hearings on Challenges Facing Rural America
Questioning FCC
Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioner Ajit Pai on FCC Budget Priorities On
Thursday, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee met with the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to discuss their FY2015 budget request. This year&#8217;s FCC budget
request asks for additional money for technology upgrades to make the agency more efficient and additional
staff to enhance enforcement of the E-Rate and Lifeline programs that have shown signs of waste, fraud
and abuse. During the hearing, I had an opportunity to question FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioner
Ajit Pai about rural broadband, the future of Universal Service and the Connect America Fund, and the
upcoming broadcaster incentive auction, which will make new airwaves available for mobile broadband services.
Access to affordable broadband is critical for every Kansas community. I will continue to work with my
colleagues to ensure the FCC not only uses their funds wisely to achieve the goals set out by Congress,
but also makes common sense policy decisions that increase access to broadband and next generation communications.

from the hearing.
Questioning
Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Farm Bill Implementation As
a member of the Subcommittee for Agriculture Appropriations, I had the opportunity to question U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack this week. We primarily discussed implementation of the Farm
Bill, and I asked him to provide a timeline so producers know when the new farm programs will be up and
running.
The
first set of programs to be implemented are the Livestock Disaster Programs, and signups should be available
as soon as April 15 with producer payments being delivered thereafter. Right now, USDA is working to
draft the rules for the commodity and crop insurance programs, as well as educate Farm Service Agency
(FSA) staff and producers on the new programs. USDA is hopeful that by late summer producers will have
the opportunity to update yields and acres with their FSA office, and by early fall the final rules for
the new programs will be available. Additionally, signups for farm programs should available by the end
of the year.
I
also reminded Secretary Vilsack that one of his primary roles is to be an advocate for agriculture within
the administration. It's imperative that the issues facing rural America are explained and understood
by an increasingly urban Congress. I will continue to advocate for agriculture, and implore my colleagues
from rural America to do the same.
Overregulation
by the Environmental Protection Agency Continues
Proposed Clean Water Act Rule This
week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposed
a new Clean Water Act rule. The rule would expand their authority of waters regulated by the Clean Water
Act. Unfortunately, the EPA continues to draft and implement unreasonable rules that increase burdens
for farmers and ranchers in Kansas and across the country. The proposed rule would expand federal authority
to almost all waters in the United States including small streams and wetlands on private property that
dry up during the summer months. This is yet another example of federal government overreach and unnecessary
intrusion into the lives of Americans, and I encourage Kansas producers to make their voices heard.
Click

to comment on the proposed rule.
EPA
Employment Impact Analysis Act I also joined Senator Jim Inhofe
of Oklahoma this week in introducing the EPA Employment Impact Analysis Act, a bill to prohibit the EPA
from finalizing any major regulations until the agency analyzes the economic impact of its current air
regulations as required under Section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act.
Once
again, American businesses are being put at a competitive disadvantage and losing access to world markets
because of government overreach. Our government should not be an adversary when it comes to the success
of a business in the United States. The legislation would stop the EPA from implementing any more job-killing
regulations until the economic impact of its current regulations are fully known. Hopefully, businesses
in Kansas and across our country may be optimistic about the future of the American economy.

TRIO
Breakfast
On Tuesday, I attended the Kansas TRIO Programs&#8217;
20th Annual Legislative Breakfast. TRIO programs operate in 19 Kansas post-secondary schools and provide
services to students from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, students with disabilities, adult
learners and veterans to support them in achieving their goal of completing higher education, and often
becoming the first in their family to earn a college degree.
I
had the opportunity to meet Kansas TRIO alumni Shanda Burch and Kimberly Woolf, and hear their inspiring
personal stories about pursuing higher education with the support of TRIO programs. Thank you to Wichita
State&#8217;s Kaye Monk-Morgan for emceeing the event and for the Kansas TRIO staffs for hosting the
breakfast. As a first-generation college graduate myself, I am proud of the effectiveness of TRIO programs
at our schools and have seen their success firsthand.
L&#8217;Taken
Seminar
On Tuesday, four young Kansans from Topeka&#8217;s Temple
Beth Sholom met with my staff as part of the 2014 L&#8217;Taken seminar. Each year, thousands of Jewish
teens from across the nation travel to Washington, D.C., to learn about issues of social justice and
visit with their representatives to advocate legislative action. This program is a great way for young
people to learn about public policymaking and have a real opportunity to consider and articulate which
issues matter to them and why. Thanks to Rabbi Debbie Stiel of Temple Beth Sholom for chaperoning the
trip.
Visiting
Labette County
Labette Health Visit On
Friday, I traveled to Labette County to visit Labette Health in Parsons. Labette Health, which has provided
health care to families in southeast Kansas since 1961, is a 99-bed acute, intensive and rehabilitation
care hospital. The hospital provides 24/7 emergency care, surgical services, inpatient and outpatient
rehabilitation services, and laboratory services to name a few. I always appreciate the opportunity to
meet with Kansas hospital administrators, medical staff, and other providers to gain insight on the unique
challenges they face caring for patients.
During
my visit, we discussed Labette Health&#8217;s initiatives to increase patient care quality and utilize
community resources to enhance health services in the area. They emphasized the importance of targeted
rural health initiatives, such as Medicare Dependent Hospital designation and the Low-Volume Hospital
adjustment, which support rural hospitals that work under tight operating margins to care for patients
across wide areas. We also discussed concerns with federal regulations that fail to account for the reality
of delivering health care in Kansas and across rural America. For example, unreasonable and inflexible
physician supervision rules relating to the provision of outpatient therapeutic services, which include
drug infusions, blood transfusions, wound debridement, and cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services,
are making it difficult for many hospitals in Kansas and other rural states to provide these services
to patients. The Senate has passed legislation I introduced, S. 1954, to prevent the federal government
from enforcing these burdensome regulations for Critical Access Hospitals and other small, rural hospitals
in 2014. Another concern we visited about were Medicare audit regulations that are flawed and cause serious
financial challenges and unnecessary administrative burdens for Kansas hospitals and other health providers.
Reducing fraud, waste and abuse in Medicare is an extremely important goal that I support, however the
government also must be careful not to overburden providers to an extent that restricts their ability
to care for patients. As Ranking Member of Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee, I continue to advocate
for reasonable regulatory flexibility for rural hospitals and other health providers to deliver the care
that is essential to Kansas communities. Thanks to Labette Health CEO Jodi Schmidt for hosting my visit,
and to Kansas Hospital Association President and CEO Tom Bell for stopping by.
Zetmeir
Health Science Facility Ribbon Cutting
While in Parsons, I participated in the ribbon cutting
ceremony for the new Sonny and Sophia Zetmeir Health Science Facility on the campus of Labette Community
College (LCC). LCC has a major role in educating the skilled workers necessary for economic growth in
southeast Kansas and throughout our state. LCC has been tremendously successful in educating the skilled
health professionals who will have a positive impact on the lives of all those in the communities they
serve. Access to health care providers is essential to the survival and success of communities in Kansas
and across the country. The care these providers administer determines whether individuals can remain
in the communities they call home and whether their children will return to those communities to raise
their families. I appreciate LCC&#8217;s commitment to providing high-quality training to the next generation
of health professionals who will contribute to the success of our communities for decades to come.
Congratulations
to LCC students, faculty and alumni on the opening this new state-of-the-art facility. I extend my thanks
to the members of the Board of Trustees, the Capital Campaign Committee and the LCC Foundation and Alumni
Association for their many years of hard work and a real team effort on this project. Thanks to all the
donors, especially Sophia Zetmeir and her late husband Sonny, for your investment in the future of LCC,
Parsons and our state. And thank you to LCC President Dr. George Knox for inviting me to take part in
the day&#8217;s events.
Kansas
Listening Tour Stops in Bourbon and Rooks Counties
Last week, I held a Kansas Listening Tour stops in Bourbon and Rooks
Counties.
Prior
to my town hall meeting in Fort Scott, I stopped by the courthouse to visit with County Commissioners
Barbara Albright, Allen Warren and Harold Coleman and County Clerk Kendell Mason, as well as made a quick
stop at the National Historic Site. I appreciated Fort Scott area residents who came out to discuss a
variety of issues such as government regulations, banking and the federal budget. Medicare reimbursements,
the Affordable Care Act and concerns with the employer mandate were also topics of discussion. Thanks
to the Karen Endicott-Coyan and Reta Baker at Mercy Health Systems for hosting my town hall. Thanks to
State Representative Adam Lusker; Bourbon County Commissioners Barbara Albright, Allen Warren and Harold
Coleman; and Tom Bell with the Kansas Hospital Association for attending.

Saturday, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour at Barney's in Palco. About 35 folks from around the area
turned out to share concerns and give feedback on a wide range of topics &#8212; from the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service&#8217;s decision to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as a threatened species, to First
Amendment rights and Obamacare. We also discussed the importance of improving health care for veterans
and tackling the national debt. Thanks again to everyone who attended including Rooks Co. Commissioner
John Ruder. Thanks to Barney&#8217;s for hosting the Listening Tour stop.
The
issues I focus on and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely based on the conversations I have with
Kansans during these town hall meetings. Thanks to all the folks who came out and shared a dose of Kansas
common sense. Check my
website
for
upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops.

Community Leaders Visit Washington
This week, leaders from several Kansas communities came
to Washington to visit their elected officials. They were also in town to meet with representatives from
federal agencies whose projects and programs affect their respective communities. We were happy to host
representatives from Dodge City, Garden City, Great Bend, Greensburg, Hays, Leavenworth and Liberal.
Thanks to everyone who made the trip and stopped by our office.
