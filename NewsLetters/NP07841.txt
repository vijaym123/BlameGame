Dear
Friend,
Staying in touch with you and maintaining open lines of
communication is important so that you can stay informed with what is going
on in Congress and so that I can hear the opinions and concerns of the
people I represent.
Facebook,
Twitter
and
YouTube
have been some of the most
effective ways to stay in contact with the people of the Third District.
They have allowed me to provide fast and consistent information, as well
as garner feedback from you.
Id like to encourage you
to
Like
my official Facebook page,
Follow
my official Twitter page and
subscribe
to my Youtube channel.
I utilize these pages to discuss
the issues facing Congress, and to let you know what Im up to in
Washington, D.C. I also post frequent survey questions ( https://tsongas.house.gov/survey-question ) and recognize the great
communities in our region each week during my Third District
Thursdays.
And we are currently hosting the Spring/Summer Photo
Contest!
Over the winter
I hosted a
photo contest on my Facebook page, which resulted in some amazing
seasonal photos submitted from across the Third District. We used several
as the Pages cover photo. Now I am encouraging you to again submit
your original photo submissions of places and things from around the
Third District to
TsongasPhoto@gmail.com . Be sure
to include your name, where you live and a description of your photo.
Submissions will be accepted until July 18.
And dont
forget to head over and
Like my
Facebook page
to see all the wonderful submissions as they come
in!
I hope youll follow along and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas
