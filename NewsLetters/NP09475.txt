#RoadLessTraveledUtah Contest
Utah
has over 43,000 miles of public roads.
These roads connect
communities, pass through some of the most beautiful landscapes in the
country, and they enable Utahns to enjoy an enviable standard of
living.
I would like to showcase an outstanding collection of Utahs roads
in my Washington DC office.
Utahgram and I have joined together
to invite you to submit your photographs of Utahs roads to this
Instagram photo contest.
In addtion to photos being displayed in
Senator Lee's office, he will also send a flag flown of the U.S. Capitol
to the three entrants whose submissions receive the most likes on
Instagram.
As you travel through the state this Memorial Day weekend,
I am confident you will find inspiration for this contest.
Here
are the rules:
Be safe.
Pictures taken by
drivers while driving will not be considered.
The photo
has to contain a road in Utah.
Only 1 photo per
person.
Multiple photos will be selected for the display, but only 1
photo per person will be selected.
For communication
