Dear Friend,
Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon Johnson announced the launch of
Project Head Start, a federal program that delivers health,
nutritional, academic, and other services to low-income, preschool
children, giving them an early boost in life.
Today, Head Start serves over one million disadvantaged children
throughout the country, including over 15,000 in Indiana and 1,844 in
Marion County.
I believe every child in America should be afforded an equal
opportunity to succeed, regardless of what neighborhood they live in or
how much money their parents make.
That is why I have always been
proud to support Head Start and its commitment to help ensure our
students can reach their full potential.
Nothing has better returns than our investments in education, from
early childhood through lifetime learning.
Affordable, accessible
education is essential for succeeding in the American economy, and it
is my hope that we can continue to strengthen our community by
providing children with quality education early on in their development.
It is my privilege to be a champion for early education in Congress and
I will continue to work with my colleagues to support these childhood
programs. It is an honor to serve you in Washington, if you have any
questions, please feel free to contact my office.
Sincerely,
Andr Carson
Member of Congress
