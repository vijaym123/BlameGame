Hello,
Last November,
the American people spoke loud and clear that they wanted Congress to
take the lead to start solving our nation's
problems.
They were sick of the
inaction and they wanted Congress to get things
done.
Well, I certainly listened
and have been working with my colleagues to get
results.
Here's a look at
what we've accomplished in our first few months of
Congress
14 : That's how many years it has been since Congress passed a
budget that balances without raising taxes on
Americans.
This w eek, when the Senate passed our Conference
Budget, we officially set a new
milestone.
62 : That's the number of bills we've passed out of the
House.
That's more than double the 25 bills we passed
in the first 100 days of
2013.
8 : That's how many of these bills that have
gone on to pass the Senate.
Not only that, all 8
of those bills have been signed into
law.
1974 : That's the last time Congress
has started the Appropriations process this
early.
2 : That's the number of Appropriations
bills we have already passed out of the
House.
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am
particularly proud that we've been able to put our head down and get these
bills passed.
This progress
has led to one of the most productive first 100 days under Republican
control in modern history.
That's something I'm proud to be part
of.
Mother's Day
I want to wish a Happy Mother's Day to all of the hardworking
mothers who sacrifice to make life better for their children everyday.
I hope you
have a great day, you deserve it.
I work hard every day to serve and
represent you to the best of my ability and will continue working for
solutions in Congress.
