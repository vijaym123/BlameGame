Subject: We're all very proud
Friend,
Did you see Ami's email yesterday? We're all very proud of the fact that a group of grassroots supporters has stepped up and committed to match all donations until tonight's midnight deadline -can you click here and give $5 or $10 right now to help Ami's team hit their goal?secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/teamberacrucialdeadline
This deadline is truly the most important one my husband has faced - and if Team Bera doesn't hit this goal, they'll have to start making cuts to all the get-out-the-vote programs they've worked so hard to implement. We simply can't let that happen. Please click here and give $5 or more so that things can continue as planned - and remember, your donations today will be doubled! secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/teamberacrucialdeadline
Thank you,
Janine Bera, MD

Friend,
Wanted to make sure you saw Janine&#39;s email this morning.
I&#39;m glad she reached out-- we need your help today.
I just checked, and we&#39;re close to beating our goal .
Click here and give now to push us over the edge before
midnight.
This is the most important end of quarter deadline we&#39;ve faced, and Ose&#39;s team and the national pundits will use these numbers to gauge our strength.
Let&#39;s show them what we can do -
please give $5, $10, or more now.
Have a fabulous day.
Be well, Ami.
