Dear Friend,
As we embark
on our annual commemoration of Black History Month there are many
markers of the contributions of the African American community to our
nations enrichment and advancement.
This month we do not just look
back to learn our past, but also so that we may be better prepared for
what lies ahead.
The historic achievements of one generation are
the building blocks of another.
We live in an
America that boasts a President of African descent, two African American
Senators, and over three-dozen African American Congressional
Representatives.
This was but a dream when Carter G. Woodson founded Negro
History Week in 1929.
Today it is our remarkable reality as a
nation.
This moment in time embodies so many of the hopes and
aspirations of blacks who struggled through unspeakable tribulations to
make America a more equitable and just country for all her
people.
February is indeed another opportunity to reacquaint ourselves
with Martin, Zora, and Duke, and other historical figures who through
Black History Month many will recall with familiarity or learn about
for the first time.
Just as importantly, Black History Month is
also a unique opportunity to reacquaint ourselves with America's
Promise, and recommit ourselves to making this country better.
There is much work to be done as too many Americans struggle to achieve
the American dream, and to feel they have a level playing field where
one's status at birth does not determine lifes
destiny.
This month our nation pays special tribute to the history of African
Americans.
It is a history that is abundant with the spirit of
perseverance and indelible markers that have made our country the great
nation that it is.
In so doing we continue to cultivate the
dreams and goals that will serve as an inspiration for all communities to
keep pushing America toward her highest potential.
