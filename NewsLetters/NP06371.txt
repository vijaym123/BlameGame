... This is a warning from Democratic Headquarters &hellip; Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)
Nancy Pelosi emailed you yesterday asking for your help to defeat Koch-funded Republicans.
Sadly, it looks like we haven&rsquo;t heard from you.
David Johnson Chipped in to Defeat Koch-Funded Republicans? NO DONATION Deadline: 11:59 PM Suggested Support: $5.OO
Look -- we&rsquo;re still lagging dangerously behind.
If we can&rsquo;t turn this thing around, we might as well hand the entire U.S. government over to the Koch Brothers.
We&rsquo;re nearly out of time: There are less than 7 hours until our MIDNIGHT deadline.
But if every person who reads this email gives at least $5, we can still hit our $5OO,OOO goal.
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount. Thanks,
DCCC
