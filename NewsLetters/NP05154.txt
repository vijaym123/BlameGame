TRIPLE-MATCH ** DONATIONS REMAINING ** To keep our Democratic campaigns funded, we&rsquo;re triple-matching 1O,OOO gifts only before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline.
DONATE &gt;&gt;
First the bad (ok, TERRIFYING) news:
USA Today just reported that a single right-wing mega donor wrote a
$5,OOO,OOO.OO
check to John Boehner&rsquo;s SuperPAC. That means Boehner can blast TVs across the country with Obama-bashing ads. Here&rsquo;s the good (ok, AMAZING) news: To help our Democratic campaigns respond, a group of Democratic supporters have agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH 1O,OOO donations before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline.
David, we can&rsquo;t throw away this opportunity. We need you to stop what you&rsquo;re doing, answer President Obama&rsquo;s request, and help us stop Republicans from buying this election with their secret right-wing money.
