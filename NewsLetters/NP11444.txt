This week, the House passed multiple bills under suspension,
including the Farmers Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act ( H.R. 311 ), the Equitable Access to Care and Health
(EACH) Act ( H.R. 1814 ), the Federal Communications
Commission Process Reform Act
( H.R. 3675 ),
the Hire More Heroes Act ( H.R. 3474 ), and
the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act ( H.R. 3979 ).
In addition to these suspensions, on
Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 4138 , the ENFORCE the
Law Act, by a vote of 233-181.
H.R. 4138 establishes a
procedure for the House of Representatives or the Senate to authorize a
lawsuit against the executive branch for failing to faithfully execute the
laws.
H.R. 4138 has been sent to the Senate for
consideration.
Also on Wednesday, the National League of Cities honored me
as the first recipient of the NLC Presidents Award.
As a former
mayor and Arkansas Municipal League member, the significance of this
award is especially meaningful, and I am grateful to receive this
honor.
On Thursday morning, both Department of Health and Human Services
Secretary Sebelius and Department of Defense Secretary Hagel were on
the Hill to testify before the House Appropriations
Committee.
Thursday afternoon, the House passed
H.R. 3973 ,
the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014, by a vote of
244-171.
H.R. 3973 amends federal law to require the Attorney General to
report to Congress any time a federal official establishes or
implements a formal or informal policy to refrain from enforcing any
provisions of federal law.
H.R. 3189 has been sent to the Senate for
consideration.
The House also passed
H.R. 3189 , the Water
Rights Protection Act, by a vote of 238-174.
H.R. 3198 prohibits
the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture from
requiring an entity to turn over its privately-held water rights to the
federal government in order to qualify for a federal permit, lease, or
other land use agreement.
The bill also prohibits the agencies
from requiring a water user to seek a water right in the federal
governments name as a condition of qualifying for a federal permit, lease,
or other land use agreement.
H.R. 3189 has been sent to the
Senate for consideration.
Finally, on Friday,
March 14, 2014, the House passed
H.R. 4015 , the
SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014, by a
vote of 238-181.
H.R. 4015 repeals the current sustainable
growth rate formula and replaces it with a permanent solution to address
physician payments in the Medicare program. The replacement bill is
offset by a five year delay of the individual mandate tax penalty.
H.R. 4015 has been sent to the Senate for
consideration.
Next week, the House will stand in recess for the district work
period.
Hope to see you while Im home!
