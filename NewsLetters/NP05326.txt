David, virtually
every
Republican group just jumped into our race.
SEP 29th: The Kochs cut our opponent a MASSIVE check.
OCT 8th: Karl Rove launched a deceptive ad campaign targeting Cheri.
OCT 17th: Chris Christie hosted a fundraiser for Tea Partier Bobby Schilling.
Bottom line:
a new poll just showed our race within a SINGLE-DIGIT. If we fail to respond to the Republican cash today,
Cheri&rsquo;s first re-election could be lost for good.
Only your grassroots support can turn the tide.
David, if you&rsquo;re able, please make a small contribution before tonight&rsquo;s deadline. Every dollar helps.
