Need Jobs?
Dear Friend,
I know that families in the Fourth District are struggling. That's why
I voted in favor of three jobs bills this week, all of which passed the
House of Representatives. The first bill is the Federal Lands Jobs and
Energy Security Act
, legislation
that would expand onshore American energy production on federal lands
and create new American jobs by streamlining government red-tape and
regulations. The bill is a no-brainer. It will put families across the
country back to work, especially in western states, where a significant
portion of land is federally owned. Click HERE
to read my
official statement on this bill.
The second bill is the Protecting States' Rights to Promote American
Energy Security Act
, legislation that
would protect American jobs and energy production by limiting the Obama
Administration's ability to impose duplicative federal regulations on
hydraulic fracturing. This common-sense legislation is a job-saver. It
will keep the federal government from wasting time and resources
imposing a one-size-fits-all regulatory structure on hydraulic
fracturing. Click HERE
to read my official
statement in regard to this bill.
The third bill is the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act
, bipartisan legislation that expedites the federal review
process for natural gas pipeline permitting. This bill will ease
permitting delays for natural gas pipelines, which will not only
mitigate a potential shortage of gas-based electricity but will also
create much-needed jobs. With so many families struggling to find work,
we can't afford to continue to let government get in the way of job
creation. Click HERE
to read my official statement concerning this legislation.
Fighting for Your Privacy; We Can't Ignore the Fourth Amendment
Thursday I introduced the Reasonable Expectation of American Privacy
Act
. This bill would prevent the federal government from
forcing or coercing companies to provide personal online passwords,
unless a specific warrant is obtained for a specific individual or
group, each of which must be the subject of a relevant investigation.
Spying on hundreds of millions of Americans, from innocent grandmothers
to high school students, using highly controversial and perverse legal
interpretations is contrary to core American values. It's time for
Congress to listen to the public outcry over our federal surveillance
programs. These programs are intended to keep us safe from harm, not
attach themselves to every facet of our private lives. Click HERE
to read more.
An Unbreakable Code
On Wednesday, I attended the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony in honor
of Native American Code Talkers. These Native Americans transmitted
code based on 33 tribal dialects during combat operations in World War
I and II. I am humbled by their courage and sacrifice, especially to a
nation that did not always allow them the same rights for which they
fought. It was an honor to attend the ceremony.
(Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitors Center is packed for the
ceremony, November 20, 2013)
Passing Legislation is Like Pulling Teeth
Thursday I enjoyed speaking at the annual Oral Health Research
Organization luncheon. I explained how my career as a dentist prepared
me for Congress. After all, passing legislation is a lot like pulling
teeth. As a dentist impersonating a congressman, I welcome most any
opportunity I can get to speak to professionals in the oral health
industry.

Join Me and Tell Us How Obamacare is Hurting You
Is ObamaCare hurting you? Is it hurting your family or friends? Are you
one of the millions who lost their insurance policy or saw their
premiums skyrocket?
Let your voice be heard at a Congressional Field Hearing in Arizona's
4th District.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which I am a
member, is holding a hearing in Arizona entitled "ObamaCare
Implementation, The Broken Promise: If You Like Your Current Plan You
Can Keep It." The hearing will focus on taking testimony from witnesses
whose healthcare plans were cancelled as a result of Obamacare. Click
HERE
for details.
20 New or Higher Taxes
Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes. As the economy continues to
sputter, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on families and
small businesses. Obamacare is not only unworkable but it is also
unaffordable. Click HERE

billion-plus in tax hikes over the next ten years.
Obamacare Malady of the Week
58%: The percentage of Americans, a clear majority, who have an
unfavorable view of Obamacare. The American people know a bad law when
they see one. We need to replace Obamacare with patient-centered,
free-market legislation.
Congressional District 4: DID YOU KNOW?
The communities in the northwestern corner of District 4 - including
Littlefield, Scenic and Beaver Dam - are isolated from the rest of
Arizona by the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon. In order to reach
the rest of our state by car, residents have to exit Arizona and
re-enter through Nevada or Utah.

Dear
Friend,
I
know
that
families
in
the
Fourth
District
are
struggling.
That's
why
I
voted
in
favor
of
three
jobs
bills
this
week,
all
of
which
passed
the

on

and
create

by
streamlining
government
red-tape
and
regulations. The bill
is
a
no-brainer.
It
will
put
families
across
the
country
back
to
work,
especially
in
western
states,
where
a
significant
portion
of
land
is
federally
owned.
