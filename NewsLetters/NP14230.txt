The Huizenga Huddle: Nov. 20, 2013
Upcoming Event :
Town Hall in Muskegon Heights on Friday.
I want to hear from you!
This Friday, November 22nd at 3 PM, I will be hosting a town hall meeting in Muskegon Heights at the Muskegon Area Transit System Administration Office and Louis A. McMurray Conference Center located at 2624 Sixth St.
I hope you will join me in discussing the federal issues impacting Muskegon Heights, Muskegon County and West Michigan.
What's Happening In Washington :
On Friday, the House passed legislation to allow people who have had their individual insurance policies canceled because of ObamaCare to keep that insurance, by a vote of 261 to 157.
While there is much more to do to address health care, this was a significant vote because 39 House Democrats joined Republicans in working to protect Americans from the negative impacts of ObamaCare.
On Thursday evening, I discussed how ObamaCare is impacting residents of the Second District. Click the picture below to watch my "one minute" on YouTube.
In The Second District :
For Veterans Day, I joined officials at Grand Valley State University for the dedication of a
new Student Veterans' Lounge at the Kirkhof Center . Additionally, GVSU announced it is going to begin offering in-state tuition for our nation's veterans. Read more about GVSU's commitment to ensuring our men and women in uniform as well as our veterans have access to a quality education in West Michigan
HERE .
Later that afternoon, I had the honor of
holding a medals ceremony to reunite West Michigan veterans
or their surviving family members with the medals and commendations earned during their time in the service.
You can view pictures from the ceremony in Grand Haven
HERE .
While Veterans Day is listed on the calendar as November 11th, the admiration we show our servicemen and women should last year-round . If you know a veteran in the Second District that has lost , misplaced, or never received the medals they earned during their time in the service, please call my Grandville office at (616) 570-0917.
Financial Services Update :
On Wednesday, I chaired a Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee Hearing examining central banks from developed economies across the globe and how they compare to the Federal Reserve.

Thursday morning, I spoke with Gary Stevens on 1450 WHTC about the Federal Reserve artificially lowering interest rates, ObamaCare, and the need for a balanced budget amendment.
The full interview is available
here .
Thursday evening, the House Financial Services Committee unanimously passed my legislation, H.R. 2274, The Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification Act. This legislation will remove regulatory roadblocks threatening job creation, economic growth, and future investment while allowing for the smooth sale and transfer of both small and mid-sized businesses.
A 57-0 vote demonstrates how substantive legislation can be offered and gain bipartisan support despite the vast philosophical divide that currently exists
in Washington.
I will be sure to keep you informed when this legislation will come to the House floor.
