At the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have had a proven record of bipartisan success and that will only continue to grow in the coming years, Upton, the chairman of the committee, said. Earlier this year, my Democratic colleague Diana DeGette joined me in launching the
21st Century Cures
initiative with the goal of accelerating the pace of new cures and treatments. We have heard from patients, researchers, care givers and innovators for the past several months about the tremendous opportunities we have in the United States to find treatments for the thousands of diseases without them and close the gap between the science of cures and how we regulate them.
Upton said the committee would continue to advance the 21st Century Cures initiative in hopes of bringing hope to patients across the country.
This is also our chance to govern on energy and environmental policy, Upton said. We achieved great bipartisan success in the House this Congress advancing commonsense solutions that seek to harness the benefits of the American energy boom and empower states. We unveiled a broad new energy vision called the
Architecture of Abundance , which includes plans to build a modern new energy infrastructure and increase energy efficiency. We want to build off our past successes and work together to see these policies enacted.
Upton also noted that the committees work to update the nations
communications laws
to meet the demands of the 21st century.
Over the next several months, we will take what we have learned from our hearings and white papers to update the law to boost job creation and economic growth in the innovation era, Upton said. Likewise, we have made progress on key issues to consumers, workers and job creators, exploring issues that range from data protection to privacy to manufacturing. We will continue to advance these priorities in the coming year.
Creating jobs and growing the economy will also remain focal points of the committee going forward, Upton said.
