Over the past few weeks, I traveled across our state, visiting with
folks from all walks of life. I had lots of meetings, roundtable
discussions with small business owners, and eight factory tours. I
heard about the need to create more jobs, bring down the cost of
healthcare, and get our economy moving again. But there was another
issue that was on a lot of people's minds-the need for new approaches
to prevent and treat drug abuse, especially in the wake of a heroin
epidemic that is now taking the lives of four Ohioans every day.
I believe the best approach to drug abuse prevention starts at the
community level. To help focus those resources on the new challenges we
are facing, I organized townhall meetings in Franklin and Jackson
Counties, where I heard first-hand from concerned parents, teachers,
treatment professionals, people who have lost loved ones, and folks who
are fighting addictions they've been struggling with for years about
what we can do to turn the tide of drug abuse. I want to share with you
some of their stories.
I met with Paul Shoonover, a father whose son Matt died of a heroin
overdose at the age of 19 years old, just two days after getting out of
rehab. Paul has channeled his grief into his work to bring discussions
about addiction and heroin not only into classrooms, but to family
dinner tables.
I also met with Sarah Nerad, a young woman who is working to overcome
her own addiction in long-term recovery.
Sarah told me that recovery
starts in treatment, but it happens in the community. So even as Sarah
is fighting her own battle, she is working at Ohio State with students
in recovery to build the kind of community support network that they
will need as they move forward with their lives.
The experiences of
Sarah and Paul are not all that different from
thousands of Ohioans I have worked with over my last twenty years of
involvement in the drug prevention and treatment arena. In 1995, after
meeting with a mother who had lost her young son to a drug overdose, I
joined together with community leaders around southwest Ohio to form
the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. I served as its chair
for nine years, and I still work with it today. The Coalition sought to
tackle the problem of addiction before it started, focusing on
grassroots prevention and education to turn communities around from the
inside. I'm happy to report that the Coalition has seen tremendous
success, and its efforts have helped lead to a 30 percent reduction of
adolescent substance abuse in the Greater Cincinnati area. Similar
coalitions exist throughout Ohio and there are now over 5,000
coalitions all over the country, in part because of my bill, the Drug
Free Communities Act, which became law in 1997.
These successes are something to celebrate, but while we know
it is better if we can prevent drug abuse before it starts, prevention
can only take us so far. We also have to help those who have fallen
into addiction to take back their lives.
One way to break the grip of addiction is to leverage our criminal
justice system-where so many who struggle with drug abuse end up-using
approaches that we know work. A decade ago I authored the Second Chance
Act, a law that supports proven drug treatment and job training
programs for newly-released inmates. In the states that have taken
advantage of it, we have seen significant reductions in recidivism-down
double-digits in Ohio alone. Now we are working on a reauthorization of
the Second Chance Act, and I have crafted bipartisan legislation-the
Recidivism Reduction and Public Safety Act-that would apply the same
proven methods in justice reinvestment and reentry that have worked in
the states to federal prisons.
This week, I co-hosted a conference in the U.S. Capitol to focus on
preventing and treating drug abuse as well as addressing recidivism
issues in the criminal justice system. The forum was a bipartisan
convening of public health advocates, members of law enforcement,
public officials, and researchers aimed at identifying best practices
and strategies at the intersection of criminal justice, addiction, and
recovery.
The fight against addiction will continue on long after we are gone,
but we must do all we can to make a difference today. That difference
isn't measured in dollars and cents or in numbers and statistics. It's
measured in lives saved, in dreams realized, and in communities reborn.
Recent Visits Around Ohio
Saw where our recycling goes: Rumpke in Cincinnati is impressive; one
of the largest, fastest, and most technologically advanced recycling
facilities in the country.
Discussed my Jobs for America
plan with workers at City Machine
Technologies (CMT) in Youngstown.
Spoke at the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance about how Washington
regulations impede business and how to increase economic opportunities
in the region.
Visited Bellisio Foods-one of the largest food processing centers in
the country-located in Jackson, Ohio.
Discussed the need for fair trade and tax reform at Byer Steel in
Cincinnati.
Met with Steel Warehouse employees in Cleveland to talk about workforce
training and manufacturing issues.
Many taxpayers support the National Science Foundation's (NSF) mission
of funding vital scientific research into areas such as life-saving
medical technology, understanding the universe, and developing
supercomputers.
Unfortunately, the NSF does not always spend our tax dollars wisely. It
recently spent $700,000 supporting a musical about climate change
called the "The Great Immensity."
This musical is being produced by "The Civilians," an "investigative
theater" group in New York seeking to mobilize public opinion on
environmental issues. The musical's website
describes a "continent-hopping thriller
following a woman, Phyllis.who uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding
the upcoming international climate summit in Auckland. As the days
count down to the Auckland Summit, Phyllis must decipher the plan and
possibly stop it in time.."The Great Immensity" is a highly theatrical
look into one of the most vital questions of our time: how can we
change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous
environmental challenges that confront us?"
I have long supported NSF and its role funding new and innovative
research that saves lives, improves technology, and explains the world
around us. But spending $700,000 on a musical is far outside the
agency's mission. I wonder which legitimate scientific grant
application was denied in order to fund this frivolous project.

Over
the
past
few

I

But
there
was another

that
was
on
a

of
people's
minds&#8212;the
need
for
new
approaches
to
prevent

treat
drug

especially
in
the
wake
of
a
heroin
epidemic
that
is
now taking
the
lives
of four
Ohioans
every
day.
I believe
the
best
approach
to
drug
abuse
prevention
starts
at
the
community
level.
To
help
focus
those
resources
on
the
new

they&#8217;ve
been
struggling
with

what
we
can
do
to
turn
the
tide
of
drug

I
want
to
share
with
you
some
of
their
stories.
I
met
with
Paul
Shoonover,
a
father
whose
son
Matt
died
of
a
heroin
overdose
at
the
age
of
19
years
old,
just
two
days
after
getting
out
of
rehab.
Paul
has
channeled
his
grief
into
his
work
to
bring
discussions
about
addiction
and
heroin
not
only
into
classrooms,
but
to
family

I
also
met
with
Sarah
Nerad,
a
young
woman
who
is
working
to
overcome
her
own
addiction
in
long-term
recovery.
Sarah
told
me
that
recovery
starts
in
treatment,
but
it
happens
in
the
community.
So
even
as
Sarah
is
fighting
her
own
battle,
she
is
working
at
Ohio
State
with
students
in
recovery
to
build
the
kind
of
community
support
network
that
they
will
need
as
they
move
forward
with
their
lives.
The
experiences
of
Sarah
and
Paul
are
not
all
that
different
from
thousands
of
Ohioans
I
have
worked
with
over
my
last
twenty
years
of
involvement
in
the
drug
prevention
and
treatment
arena.
In
1995,
after
meeting
with
a
mother
who
had
lost
her
young
son
to
a
drug
overdose,
I
joined
together
with
community
leaders
around
southwest
Ohio
to
form
the
Coalition
for
a
Drug-Free
Greater
Cincinnati.
I
served
as
its
chair
for
nine
years,
and
I
still
work
with
it
today.
The
Coalition
sought
to
tackle
the
problem
of
addiction
before
it
started,
focusing
on
grassroots
prevention
and
education
to
turn
communities
around
from
the
inside.
I&#8217;m
happy
to
report
that
the
Coalition
has
seen
tremendous
success,
and
its
efforts
have
helped
lead
to
a
30
percent
reduction
of
adolescent
substance
abuse
in
the
Greater
Cincinnati
area.
Similar
coalitions
exist
throughout
Ohio
and
there
are
now
over
5,000
coalitions
all
over
the
country,
in
part
because
of
my
bill,
the
Drug
Free
Communities
Act,
which
became
law
in
1997.
These
successes
are
something
to
celebrate,
but
while
we
know
it
is
better
if
we
can
prevent
drug
abuse
before
it
starts,
prevention
can
only
take
us
so
far.
We
also
have
to
help
those
who
have
fallen
into
addiction
to
take
back
their
lives.
One
way
to
break
the
grip
of
addiction
is
to
leverage
our
criminal
justice
system&#8212;where
so
many
who
struggle
with
drug
abuse
end
up&#8212;using
approaches
that
we

work.

Second

that
supports
proven
drug

and
job

In
the
states
that
have
taken
advantage
of
it,
we
have
seen
significant
reductions
in
recidivism&#8212;down
double-digits
in
Ohio
alone.
Now
we
are
working
on
a
reauthorization
of
the
Second
Chance
Act,
and
I
have
crafted
bipartisan
legislation&#8212;the
Recidivism
Reduction
and
Public
Safety
Act&#8212;that
would
apply
the
same
proven
methods
in
justice
reinvestment
and
reentry
that
have
worked
in
the
states
to
federal
prisons.

I

The

against

will

we

we must
do
all
we
can

make a

It
recently
spent
$700,000
supporting
a

about
climate
change
called
the
&#8220;The

This

But
spending
