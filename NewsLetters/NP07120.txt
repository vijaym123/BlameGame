This impeachment talk is no joke -- nearly every day now, another Tea Party Republican floats the idea of launching impeachment proceedings.
FIRST:
Rep. Steve King appeared on Fox News Sunday to threaten the President with impeachment.
THEN:
Rep. Walter Jones said the preposterous lawsuit against Obama isn&rsquo;t enough -- he wants impeachment.
FINALLY:
Mike Huckabee claimed that President Obama has done &ldquo;plenty of things worthy of impeachment.&rdquo;
And that&rsquo;s just from the last couple weeks&hellip;
That&rsquo;s why we need Boehner to finally stand up and squash this impeachment talk before it gets out of control. Help us get 1OO,OOO signatures on our letter demanding Boehner take impeachment off the table:

We&rsquo;ll be blunt: Boehner has proven that he&rsquo;s unwilling -- or unable -- to take on his Tea Party caucus. And they want impeachment. They want it BAD.
That means we have to force Boehner&rsquo;s hand. And for that, we need an absolute EXPLOSION of grassroots pressure. Click here to add your name to our letter demanding Boehner close the door on impeachment: http://dccc.org/Denounce-Boehner-Impeachment-Threat
