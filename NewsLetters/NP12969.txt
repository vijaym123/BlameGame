Dear David,
Today, we
celebrate the life and historic contributions of Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., who led the fight against injustice in America
both as the
leader of the civil rights movement and a champion for equal economic
opportunity for all.
His dream for this nation focused on
the belief that we as a citizenry of these United States should have
a real opportunity to share in the nations prosperity and achieve the
American Dream.
With todays widening income inequality hurting
American families, it is imperative we create policies that expand
economic opportunity. We must renew unemployment insurance for Americans
who were laid off in the recession through no fault of their
own.
On this Martin Luther King Day, let us begin the restoration
of economic security for those still reeling from the Great Recession
in America.
Respectfully,
Gloria Negrete
McLeod
Member of Congress
