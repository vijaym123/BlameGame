Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Can You Believe It?
It's been
six years
since the application to build the Keystone
XL Pipeline was first submitted. For six years, the Obama Administration has stalled on a plan that would create thousands of jobs, boost the economy,
and unlock North American energy resources. The project has been studied and debated. But for
six years
we have waited for a decision. Continuing to wait for the
President to act is not going to bring jobs to hard working Americans. That's why the House of Representatives acted once again this week to pass a
comprehensive energy package
to clear the way for the Keystone XL
pipeline as well as other energy projects throughout the nation. I hope the Senate and the White House will join us in moving forward. We can't keep
waiting.
Confronting
the ISIL Threat
We must remain ever
vigilant against threats from aggressive terrorist groups that would seek to destroy our very way of life, harm our citizens at home and abroad, or
attack our allies. The rapid expansion of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) not only poses a serious threat to a region that is no
stranger to turmoil, but also to every nation, including the United States, that rejects their brutality and extreme ideology. Like all Americans, I
was appalled by the recently released series of horrific videos by ISIL showing the barbaric executions of several hostages, including American
journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.
Atrocious acts of terror
against Americans and our allies cannot, and will not, be tolerated.
This week, Congress acted to help confront the ISIL threat.

Goodlatte Named 'Guardian of Small Business'
This week, I was honored to be named a &quot;Guardian of Small Business&quot; by the
National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Small businesses are the backbone of the economy in the Sixth District of Virginia. However, small
business owners are instead faced with the uncertainty of costly government mandates and regulations.
If we want to spur economic growth in the U.S.,
we must promote pro-growth policies that provide our small businesses the certainty they need.
I remain committed to supporting policies that protect
free enterprise, create certainty in the tax code, and cut burdensome red tape.
