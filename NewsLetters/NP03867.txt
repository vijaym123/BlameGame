We&rsquo;re doing a survey here at DSCC Headquarters, and we need your help: The last two years have seen an unprecedented number of incredibly irresponsible and reckless actions
Friend -- We&rsquo;re doing a survey here at DSCC Headquarters, and we need your help:
The last two years have seen an unprecedented number of incredibly irresponsible and reckless actions from Senate Republicans. They&rsquo;ve sabotaged the government and obstructed President Obama&rsquo;s agenda -- all for political gain or to reward the billionaires backing them.
So today, we&rsquo;re taking a poll: Who do you think was the most irresponsible Republican Senator of the last two years? Cast your vote!
Vote for Mitch McConnell &gt;&gt;
Bragged that he was the &ldquo;Guardian of Gridlock&rdquo; while leading hundreds of filibusters against raising the minimum wage, making college more affordable, and supporting equal pay for equal work
Announced that the Republican Senate will work to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Vote for Ted Cruz &gt;&gt;
Orchestrated the 2013 federal government shutdown -- what a winner!
Is the leader of the obstructionist Tea Party wing of the Republican Party.
Vote for Marco Rubio &gt;&gt;
Voted against the Senate&rsquo;s landmark immigration reform bill&hellip;the same one that he sponsored.
Doesn&rsquo;t care that his state is in danger of sinking into the ocean -- he&rsquo;s a climate change denier.
Vote for Rand Paul &gt;&gt;
Was responsible for
Politifact&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lie of the Year&rdquo; -- claiming that Ebola is &ldquo;incredibly contagious&rdquo; and a major threat.
Introduced a budget plan that would privatize Medicare and Social Security.
Or, fill in your own Republican (maybe we missed your choice) &gt;&gt;
We&rsquo;re dying to know! Who do you think the most obstructionist, irresponsible GOP Senator is?
Thanks,
Team DSCC
