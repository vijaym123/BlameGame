Dear
David,
Since I first came to Congress, I have worked
tirelessly to expand veterans access to healthcare in Ventura County. That is
why I am very pleased to announce that the Presidents FY2016 budget
request for the Department of Veterans Affairs includes a new 47,200
square foot VA community clinic in Oxnard.
One of the main
reasons why I asked to serve on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs
was to be in a position to best advocate for our local veterans. It
was clear to many in our region that the existing Community-Based
Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) was not meeting the growing needs of our region's
veterans.
Over the past two years, I have fought to
improve access to care at the Oxnard CBOC. Since that time, the CBOC
has nearly doubled its full-time mental health staff, expanded its
facility so more veterans can be served, and put a VA management team on
the ground to increase accountability.
While these
improvements have helped veterans in our region, the new Oxnard community
clinic proposed in the FY2016 budget will better ensure that they can
access the services and care they have earned and deserve closer to
home. The new clinic will offer specialty care services like optometry,
audiology, dermatology, physical therapy, mental health, and
gastroenterology, which are in high demand.
Getting the new
community clinic included in the VAs Strategic Capital Investment Plan is
only the first step towards making the proposal a reality, but it's a
very important first step. You have my word that I will continue to
remain laser-focused on the process as it moves forward until the day
the doors open. Along the way, I look forward to working with Veterans
Service Organizations, stakeholders, and constituents like you during
the planning process, so that together we can create a facility that
meets the needs of Ventura County's veterans.
The
complete project proposal can be found here:

As always, it continues to be an honor to serve as your advocate in
