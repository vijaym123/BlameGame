Friends,
The House just voted to bring legal action
against the President for ignoring his Constitutional duties and
unilaterally changing laws.
Earlier today, I spoke in favor of this
legislation,
H. Res. 676 .
A video copy of
my speech can be found below.
Tomorrow morning, I will
discuss the House lawsuit in-depth with C-SPANs Pedro Echevarria.
Tune into Washington Journal on your local C-SPAN channel at
8:20 AM ET
to view the segment live.
The program will
include viewer calls, tweets, emails and Facebook postings.
