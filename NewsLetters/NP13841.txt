Dear Friends,
Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours! As the holiday season
begins, we think not only of all that we have to be thankful for, but
also of those in need. I had the honor of serving dinner at children's
shelters in Lexington and Aiken counties earlier this week, and I
cannot express how much the experience meant to me.
As we continue debating the best way to move our nation forward, be it
in Congress or at the dinner table, it is imperative that we remember
for whom we are trying to build a better future. Our kids are the
future of this great nation, and we must ensure they are able to
receive a high-quality education and grow up in a country full of
economic freedom and opportunity. As I work towards those two goals, I
truly believe we can take major steps forward in lifting folks out of
poverty.
I am forever blessed and thankful to represent the Palmetto State in
the United States Senate. Our nation is quite simply the greatest the
world has ever seen, and as we sit around the table today please join
me in taking a moment to thank our veterans and active duty troops for
protecting our freedom.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving weekend, and I look forward to
seeing folks in Greenville and Rock Hill on Monday!
Sincerely,
Senator Tim Scott

Dear
Friends,
Happy
Thanksgiving
from
my
family
to
yours!
As
the
holiday
season
begins,
we
think
not
only
of
all
that
we
have
to
be
thankful
for,
but
also
of
those
in
need.
I
had
the
honor
of
serving
dinner
at
children&#8217;s
shelters
in
Lexington
and
Aiken
counties
earlier
this
week,
and
I
cannot
express
how
much
the
experience
meant
to
me.
As
we
continue
debating
the
best
way
to
move
our
nation
forward,
be
it
in
Congress
or
at
the
dinner
table,
it
is
imperative
that
we
remember
for
whom
we
are
trying
to
build
a
better
future.
Our
kids
are
the
future
of
this
great
nation,
and
we
must
ensure
they
are
able
to
receive
a
high-quality
education
and
grow
up
in
a
country
full
of
economic
freedom
and
opportunity.
As
I
work
towards
those
two
goals,
I
truly
believe
we
can
take
major
steps
forward
in
lifting
folks
out
of
poverty.
I
am
forever
blessed
and
thankful
to
represent
the
Palmetto
State
in
the
United
States
Senate.
Our
nation
is
quite
simply
the
greatest
the
world
has
ever
seen,
and
as
we
sit
around
the
table
today
please
join
me
in
taking
a
moment
to
thank
our
veterans
and
active
duty
troops
for
protecting
our
freedom.
Have
a
safe
and
happy
Thanksgiving
weekend,
and
I
look
forward
to
seeing
folks
in
Greenville
and
Rock
Hill
on
Monday!
