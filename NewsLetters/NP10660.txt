Friends,
While people across the
country watched Bubba Watson and Jordan Spieth battle it out for the
Master's green jacket, I spent this weekend meeting with my constituents who
possess a different green treasure: a green thumb.
Last Friday, I visited multiple farms across our district and some of
our communitys agriculture supply stores.
Agriculture has $34
billion impact on our states economy, and this industry is
growing.
We are truly blessed to live in such a beautiful and bountiful
state, but providing South Carolinians with a safe, reliable food
source is not an easy task.
I am committed to working with our
farmers to find ways we can ensure the agriculture industry is sustainable
and prosperous for years to come.
House Agriculture
Committee member and proud Texan, Congressman Mike Conaway, enjoyed viewing
some of our districts farms and hearing about the agriculture issues
impacting their profitability.
Our farmers enjoyed hearing
first-hand about pending legislation and the committees commitment to our
nations farmers.
Here are some pictures from the 7th District
Agriculture Tour:

Tax Tuesday
This Tuesday is
Tax Day, a day most Americans rightfully dread.
As the federal
tax filing deadline approaches each year, we are reminded of the
complexity of our tax code and how much of our paychecks go to the federal
government.
This week, my colleagues and I passed a budget plan
that cuts taxes, simplifies the tax code, and balances in 10 years.
The President and House Democrats both put forth budget plans that
would raise taxes to fund
more
government spending.
When our country is more than $17 trillion
dollars in debt, increasing spending is
irresponsible.
Local Vet Testifies on Preventable
Deaths
I had the pleasure last week of meeting Barry and
Donna Coates, from McBee, SC, who were in Washington, D.C. to testify
before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs about the egregious
delays in diagnosis and treatment our veterans are receiving in our
nation's VA hospitals.
VA delays have impacted Mr. Coates battle with
colon cancer and could have cost him his life. This is not the
kind of care our veterans were promised and this will not be tolerated. I
am proud to represent Mr. Coates and all of our district's
veterans. You can read about Mr. Coats testimony and the hearing
