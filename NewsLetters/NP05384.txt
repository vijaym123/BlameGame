Dear Friends,
Congressional
Review
Every week, I enjoy the chance to update constituents
throughout Southern New Mexico by recording the "Congressional Review" radio
show. This week, the show features a public meeting I attended in
Grants Oct. 13, to support the public and their concerns about a U.S.
Forest Service proposal for more wilderness to be added to the Cibola
National Forest. Public officials, forest users and the public are
concerned about the Forest Service's plans to designate more wilderness in
the Cibola. The public meeting allowed us to speak with Cibola National
Forest Supervisor Elaine Kohrman and other forest
representatives.
