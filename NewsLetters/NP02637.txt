David,
Our flag is an enduring symbol of our history, values, and the promise of freedom &amp; liberty. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so disappointing that taxpayer dollars are spent buying American flags made overseas, in countries like China.
Cheri is leading an effort to ensure that American flags purchased with taxpayer dollars are made right here in the United States. Take a stand and sign our petition to make sure that the federal government only buys American-made flags &gt;&gt;
If you think that American flags should be an American product, we need your help.
Tell Congress to ensure that American flags bought with tax dollars are made in the USA. Sign the petition:
