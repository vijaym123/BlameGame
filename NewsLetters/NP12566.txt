David --
I wanted to thank you personally.
With your support, we were able to go above and beyond the ambitious grassroots goal that we set for our first month of 2014. This is a huge milestone for this campaign -- and it&rsquo;ll put us in a strong position for the next nine months until election day.
Your continued support for this campaign is what keeps us moving forward. And I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. If you haven&rsquo;t already, will you click here to show your grassroots support by signing on to our 2014 campaign?
I am so humbled by your support and I&rsquo;m incredibly honored to represent Illinois&rsquo; 17th District.
Kindest personal regards,
Cheri
P.S. Already signed your name to say you&rsquo;re in for my 2014 campaign? Forward this to three friends now and ask them to sign their names, too!
