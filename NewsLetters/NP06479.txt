I wanted to be sure you saw that the Navy decided to allow Bibles back in Navy lodge rooms while leaders continue to review the policy. Last month, I led 25 Members of Congress in sending a bipartisan
letter
to the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, urging that donated religious materials remain in the guest rooms at Navy Lodge facilities -- after the Navy announced that it would be removing Bibles from the guest rooms.
The Constitution prohibits the government from coercing its citizens in their religious beliefs; it does not require that all vestiges of faith be scrubbed from view. I continue to urge the Navy to keep Bibles in lodging facilities, and will keep you updated on this situation.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
As the Founder and Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, I lead a bipartisan group of over 100 Members of Congress committed to defending Americas heritage of religious freedom. More information on our work protecting the religious liberties of our servicemembers is available,
