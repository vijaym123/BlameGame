Serving as a Responsible Steward of Your Taxpayer Dollars
Last week, the House voted on Legislative Branch
appropriations, which funds the operations of Congress.
As a result of
this funding bill, each Member of Congress will receive a Members'
Representational Allowance
, or MRA, to pay for most of the costs of
running our offices. For 2014, I was given $1,257,187 to use for staff
salaries, rent and expenses for three district offices, travel to and
from Washington, travel within the district, communications with
constituents and other office expenses such as computers, printers,
phones and supplies.
Since 2011, Republicans have cut MRAs by 20%
overall.
Even with those cuts, I turn back money every year.
In 2013,
we sent back more than $43,000, or 3.5% of our budget, because we
choose to run our offices as efficiently as we possibly can.
As your Representative, my main priority is serving as your voice in
Washington.
So it's very important that I visit communities across the
19th District.
When I can't be there, my staff travels to communities
to get feedback from constituents across the district. To do that at
the least possible cost, I lease two vehicles.
These cars are not for
personal use; my staff and I use our own vehicles for personal travel.
With a 35,000 square mile district (which is larger than the entire
state of South Carolina), we drove more than 32,500 miles last year.
We have assessed and reassessed the value of leasing cars versus
reimbursing staff for personal vehicle mileage.
Over and over we come
to the same conclusion: it is less expensive per month to lease two
cars than it would be to spend more than $18,000 per year reimbursing
staff for personal vehicle mileage.
At a time when families and businesses must cut back and make choices
to tighten belts and do more with less, my staff and I are doing the
same.
Balancing the federal budget must be a priority for everyone.
Voting to Hold IRS' Lois Lerner in Contempt
It's been a year since we found out that the IRS was targeting
conservative groups
.
Like you, I was outraged that the
Administration was violating the public trust and using their office
for political purposes.
But now I'm even more outraged that Lois
Lerner, who has been tied to these discriminatory decisions by hard
evidence
, won't testify before Congress about
her role in the scandal.
This week, the House will hold a vote on
whether to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress
for her failure to answer questions about IRS
targeting.
Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch is a
critical part of our country's system of checks and balances.
I plan
to get to the bottom of this scandal and hold the main actors
accountable for their actions.
This week's vote is a vote to uphold
our democracy and ensure that our system of checks and balances is
alive and healthy.
Cinco de Mayo
Today we celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
It's a time to honor the rich
Hispanic culture we have in West Texas.
Of the 53 million Hispanics in
America, over 10 million call Texas home.
They've brought countless
contributions to our communities - helping to drive our economy, defend
our nation, and sharing their strong commitment to faith, family, and
community.
I wish you all a safe and happy Cinco de Mayo.
Congratulations!
To all the young entrepreneurs who took part in Lubbock Lemonade Day
, congratulations! Lemonade Day is a great way to teach
kids business skills and encourage entrepreneurship.
If you couldn't
take part this year, save the date for 2015 Lemonade Day.

Representative
Randy
Neugebauer May

2014
Serving
as
a
Responsible
Steward
of
Your
Taxpayer
Dollars
Last
week,
the
House
voted
on
Legislative
Branch
appropriations,
which
funds
the
operations
of
Congress.
As
a
result
of
this
funding
bill,
each
Member
of
Congress
will
receive
a
Members&#8217;
Representational
Allowance ,
or
MRA,
to
pay
for
most
of
the
costs
of
running
our
offices.
For
2014,
I
was
given
$1,257,187
to
use
for
staff
salaries,
rent
and
expenses
for
three
district
offices,
travel
to
and
from
Washington,
travel
within
the
district,
communications
with
constituents
and
other
office
expenses
such
as
computers,
printers,
phones
and
supplies.
Since
2011,
Republicans
have
cut
MRAs
by
20%
overall.
Even
with
those
cuts,
I
turn
back
money
every
year.
In
2013,
we
sent
back
more
than
$43,000,
or
3.5%
of
our
budget,
because
we
choose
to
run
our
offices
as
efficiently
as
we
possibly
can.
As
your
Representative,
my
main
priority
is
serving
as
your
voice
in
Washington.
So
it&#8217;s
very
important
that
I
visit
communities
across
the
19 th
District.
When
I
can&#8217;t
be
there,
my
staff
travels
to
communities
to
get
feedback
from
constituents
across
the
district .
To
do
that
at
the
least
possible
cost,
I
lease
two
vehicles.
These
cars
are
not
for
personal
use;
my
staff
and
I
use
our
own
vehicles
for
personal
travel.
With
a
35,000
square
mile
district
(which
is
larger
than
the
entire
state
of
South
Carolina),
we
drove
more
than
32,500
miles
last
year.
We
have
assessed
and
reassessed
the
value
of
leasing
cars
versus
reimbursing
staff
for
personal
vehicle
mileage.
Over
and
over
we
come
to
the
same
conclusion:
it
is
less
expensive
per
month
to
lease
two
cars
than
it
would
be
to
spend
more
than
$18,000
per
year
reimbursing
staff
for
personal
vehicle
mileage.
At
a
time
when
families
and
businesses
must
cut
back
and
make
choices
to
tighten
belts
and
do
more
with
less,
my
staff
and
I
are
doing
the
same.
Balancing
the
federal
budget
must
be
a
priority
for
everyone.
Voting
to
Hold
IRS&#8217;
Lois
Lerner
in
Contempt
It&#8217;s
been
a
year
since
we
found
out
that
the
IRS
was

conservative

Like
you,
I
was
outraged
that
the
Administration
was
violating
the
public
trust
and
using
their
office
for
political
purposes.
But
now
I&#8217;m
even
more
outraged
that
Lois
Lerner,
who
has
been
tied
to
these
discriminatory
decisions
by
hard
evidence ,
won&#8217;t
testify
before
Congress
about
her
role
in
the

This
week,
the

hold
a
vote
on
whether
to
hold

of
Congress
f or
her
failure

Congressional
oversight
of
the
Executive
Branch
is
a
critical
part
of
our

I
