Congressman
Bruce Poliquin
Representing the 2nd District
February 27, 2015
Visit to
Togus :
I enjoyed touring
the facility and speaking with our Maine veterans at Togus. Their
commitment and sacrifice to protecting our freedoms is truly
inspiring.

Commitment to
Veterans :
Recently, Congressman
Bruce Poliquin joined his House colleagues in asking U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs Secretary, Robert McDonald, why funding for the
Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act was
cut.
Reaction to
the President's Veto :
Its a shame that the President put politics before policy by
vetoing the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
This important energy infrastructure would have
created more than 40,000 jobs, helped grow our economy and provide
another step towards energy
independence."
Right to Keep and Bear Ammo :
Its unconstitutional and overreaching for
the President to use his federal agency to restrict our right to keep
and bear arms. I will always fight to uphold and defend the Constitution
of the United States and will make sure our hard-working and
law-abiding Mainers are able to exercise their Second Amendment
rights.
Mainers in DC :
It was great to meet and speak with so many Mainers in DC this week.
