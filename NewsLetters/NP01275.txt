Hello,
It was a short but productive week at home
and in D.C. Lets get right to it:
Passing Bills
If you've
read my Weekly Wrap before, you know that I serve on the
Appropriations Committee in the House and, within that, I serve on three different
subcommittees.
This week, we had
some major accomplishments by passing two bills out of our full
committee and they will now head to the House
floor.
We passed the FY16 Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which will fund programs for our
troops, military families, defense infrastructure and our
veterans.
I serve on this subcommittee, so I was
proud to see this bill passed out of committee after all of our hard
work.
We also passed the
FY16 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which funds national security
efforts, energy security investments and critical water
infrastructure projects.
Importantly, this
bill included language that I worked very hard to get inserted in the
bill, that would make sure the Army Corps of Engineers does not dump
toxic dredge materials in our Great Lakes. It took a lot of work to get
this language in the legislation, so this is a huge win for the Great
Lakes and you can read more about that issue
here .
Here I am
discussing the legislation during a break in our bill markup with my
friend and colleague from
California.
Ensuring Clean Drinking
Water
This week, I introduced
legislation
to require
that the EPA appoint a coordinator to address the issue of harmful
algal blooms in the Great Lakes. They need our full time attention, so it
only makes sense that we put someone on the job full
time.
Keeping Us Safe from Cyber
Threats
We passed two important bills this
week in Congress that will ensure we are kept safe from cyber threats
while also protecting your privacy.
H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act
and
H.R. 1731 the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement
Act of 2015
will boost voluntary efforts from public and
private entities to share critical information with our government to combat
cyber threats.
Importantly, these bills
also ensure that your privacy is protected by adding extra layers of
security in handling this sensitive information.
Congressional Art
Competition
Are you a high school art student or do you know
someone who is?
If you want your
picture to hang in the U.S. Capitol, I hope you will encourage them
to submit an entry to the Congressional Art Competition. Learn more
here: http://joyce.house.gov/art-competition/
I hope you enjoyed seeing what I was up to this
week.
I work hard every day to serve and represent you to
the best of my ability.
