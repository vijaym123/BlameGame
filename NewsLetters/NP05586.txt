Friend-
Since 2008, the housing market has been used as a marker for determining the overall strength of the economy.
Reports have shown that the economy is starting to improve; however, many individuals havent personally seen or felt those improvements.
As the economy is picking up, do you see or feel a correlation in the housing industry?
Im interested to hear your thoughts.
Weigh in on
my blog .
Yours in service,
Randy
