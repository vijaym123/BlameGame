Tell me what you think is the best way we can provide
for our nation's veterans!
Friend,
Thanks to each of you who responded to the survey and watched my message on Social Security.
Please watch this week's video
to discover the solution that was chosen as the best way to strengthen our nation's Social Security program.
This week I highlight the work I have done for Veterans , but there's much more to do.
We owe our veterans and their families a shot at the American Dream.
We must provide our veterans with excellent health care, including mental health services; our military veterans deserve the ability to own their own homes; and our veterans deserve the excellent education benefits they have earned.
I want to hear from you!
Please fill out this survey
or send me your story, tell me about a special veteran in your family, if you are a veteran, tell me how I can better serve you and thank you for your service.
Share your message on my Facebook page or send an email to Better.Together@mail.house.gov.
Together we can achieve great things.
Sincerely,
