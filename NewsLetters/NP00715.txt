Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) participated in his annual
turkey hunt, this year in Northeast Ohio.
Portman also visited the Menorah Park Center for Senior Living in
Beachwood to announce a pilot project regarding his Better Health
Rewards
legislation.
Portman and Menorah Park have teamed up to put into place key aspects
of this program, which focuses on preventative wellness for seniors.
The Medicare "Better Health Rewards" program helps seniors set and
reach achievable goals designed to help them get and stay healthy.
Unlike the current Medicare system that begins to cost more when a
senior actually needs it, the Better Health Rewards program gives
seniors who reach their health goals - and help lower overall health
costs - a chance to share in the savings.
On Monday, Portman, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), appeared on Fox News Channel's
The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson
to discuss the latest ISIS terror threats and the Iran
nuclear negotiations.
Video of Portman's interview can be found here
.
On Tuesday, Portman released the following statement
regarding his vote to allow debate on a package of trade bills:
"I voted to move forward on this package of bills so that I can
continue to fight for my priorities of growing American exports, which
support good-paying middle-class jobs, while ensuring American workers
are competing on a level playing field by putting into place
enforceable rules to stop currency manipulation. I told Senate leaders
that I need a vote on my currency amendment and I received a commitment
that would happen. I will also continue to push for other important
enforcement measures that I strongly support, including in the customs
bill that passed in committee and would come to the floor separately
based on the bipartisan agreement in committee.
"Further, I am pleased that this first package will include an
extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance that provides important
protections for American workers and families looking to get back on
their feet. The TAA bill also includes an extension of the Health
Coverage Tax Credit which is vital for Ohio families in Youngstown,
Dayton, Sandusky and beyond."
Portman plans to offer his amendment
that puts teeth into addressing currency manipulation by holding
countries accountable to International Monetary Fund standards. It
would add explicit and enforceable currency language necessary to
ensure that foreign competitors don't use their exchange rates to
subsidize their exports at the expense of products made by American
workers.
On Wednesday, Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced
legislation to honor fallen Ohio solider and Bronze Star recipient
Daniel Kinnard
by designating the Department
of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Newark,
Ohio as the Daniel L. Kinnard Department of Veterans Affairs Community
Based Outpatient Clinic. A native of Newark, Kinnard served as a medic
in Vietnam and was awarded a Bronze Star for selflessly tending to
wounded men in his unit while under fire. U.S. Representative Pat
Tiberi (R-OH-12) introduced a House version.
"Specialist Kinnard served his country bravely in dire circumstances by
caring for and putting his fellow soldiers before himself," Portman
stated. "While we can never fully thank him for his service, I'm
pleased to introduce this legislation to honor Daniel Kinnard and
express gratitude for his extraordinary service to our country."

.
Next Monday, Portman will host a roundtable at the Chalmers P. Wylie VA
Ambulatory Care Center to focus on mental health treatment for
veterans. The Columbus VA Care Center houses a local mental health
treatment clinic.
As the United States marks National Police Week, Portman on Wednesday
joined Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and Kelly
Ayotte (R-N.H.) to introduce bipartisan legislation to close an
unintended loophole in the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB)
program and ensure families of fallen and permanently disabled officers
receive the benefits they deserve.
Families of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other first
responders killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty are
entitled to death and education benefits through PSOB, but these
benefits are occasionally denied or delayed for the loved ones of
officers who suffer severe heat stroke or over-exertion in the course
of duty. The Fairness for Fallen Officers Act of 2015 would specify
that fatal or permanently disabling climate-related injuries, including
hypothermia and hyperthermia resulting from official duties or training
in extreme weather conditions, are deserving of full recognition under
the law.
"Law enforcement officers make enormous sacrifices to keep our
communities safe, and our legislation will ensure that if they
tragically fall in the line of duty, their families will receive the
benefits they've earned," said Portman. "I'm pleased to introduce this
legislation as we recognize National Police Week, and to express
gratitude for their continued service."
"As we recognize National Police Week, the Ohio FOP thanks Senator
Portman for helping to ensure
that families of fallen officers ?get
the benefits they deserve," said Ohio FOP President Jay McDonald.
On October 9, 2001, Officer Charles McDonald of the Forest Park Police
in Ohio tragically died following SWAT training. A medical evaluation
later determined that Officer McDonald's death was the result of
rhabdomyolosis, a condition caused by extreme overexertion where the
skeletal muscles manufacture a toxin that destroys the kidneys. Officer
McDonald's family described the process of securing PSOB benefits as
long, drawn out, and painful - a process that involved hiring an
attorney, obtaining old childhood medical records, and waiting three
years for a resolution. The Fairness for Fallen Officers Act of 2015
would guarantee this doesn't happen again, by ensuring
climate-related injuries receive full recognition under the PSOB.
Also on Wednesday, Portman urged his colleagues to support his
provisions to the customs bill to boost Ohio steel manufacturers and
level the playing field for Ohio workers.
Video of his remarks can be found here
.
On Thursday, Portman, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), announced that PSI is
investigating mismanagement of the Affordable Care Act health care
exchanges
. Working to hold
the Administration accountable for Obamacare waste and mismanagement,
PSI is reviewing whether adequate verification procedures were in place
to ensure that roughly $15 billion in insurance subsidies paid out last
year reached the people who actually qualify.
Portman expressed
concern that reported breakdowns in the process for calculating
subsidies have not only been unfair to some consumers who bought
insurance through the exchanges but also put taxpayer dollars at risk.
"The Administration assured Congress that the eligibility verification
process for the exchanges was working, but millions of Americans are
now learning that they received overpayments that they have to repay.
I'm concerned that the subsidy eligibility process is so complicated
that many consumers believed they were receiving cheaper insurance
coverage than they ultimately got.
And further verification failures
risk wasting billions in hard-earned tax dollars," Portman said.
In connection with this inquiry, Portman sent a detailed letter to HHS
Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell raising several important questions
concerning the verification-including questions the Administration has
failed to answer.
PSI also issued a request for documents concerning
the reported breakdowns in the verification process for state and
federal exchanges so it could conduct its own review.
The full text of Portman's letter can be found here
.
Video of Portman discussing the inquiry on Fox News can be viewed here
.
Also on Thursday, Portman announced that three of his provisions passed
the Senate as part of the customs bill
. Portman
welcomed passage of his measure with Senator Brown to ensure steel
companies can more easily seek help from illegally undersold and
subsidized imports. Portman also welcomed the passage of legislation
he's worked on with Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) to crack down on
customs duty evasion schemes that hurt American workers through the
ENFORCE Act. Finally, Portman welcomed passage of his bill with Senator
Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that reforms the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill
process, building on his efforts to create a level playing field for
American manufacturers.
"These measures are crucial to American manufacturers and steelworkers
and ensure that they can remain globally competitive," Portman stated.
"When competitors cheat they need to be held accountable, and these
bipartisan measures will do just that. I'm pleased these provisions
have passed the Senate and urge my colleagues in the House to pass this
important bill.
"Further, I will be working with Senator Brown to push for enforcement
measures to be included next week in the final trade package that will
be signed into law."
Portman also urged his colleagues
to
support provisions to fight human trafficking in the Trade Promotion
Authority legislation. He again called for a balanced approach to trade
which includes more exports and stronger trade enforcement to hold
foreign competitors accountable when they break trade laws.
Video of Portman's remarks can be found here
.
Portman also introduced legislation
on
Thursday to ensure that Habitat for Humanity affiliates can continue to
receive donated appraisals on the homes they build. The bill makes a
technical clarification to a Dodd-Frank regulation that impacts all
Habitat for Humanity affiliates.
"This commonsense bill will ensure that all Habitat for Humanity
affiliates can fulfill their mission to help qualified families in need
without unnecessary government regulations," Portman stated. "I've seen
firsthand the good work being done by the organization, and my bill
makes a small change that will have a large positive impact for those
families relying on Habitat homes."
On Social Media:
Senate panel probes ObamaCare aid confusion, as customers learn they
owe IRS
The Senate's top investigative committee has launched an inquiry into
the system that's supposed to ensure ObamaCare tax credits go to the
right customers for the right amounts - amid concerns that many
Americans are getting inflated or improper subsidies.
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who is leading the investigation, says
because of the confusion with the system, millions of Americans are
learning after the fact they inadvertently got too much money and now
owe the IRS hundreds.
"I'm concerned that the subsidy eligibility process is so complicated
that many consumers believed they were receiving cheaper insurance
coverage than they ultimately got," Portman said in a statement.
Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, announced his panel's investigation in a letter sent
Thursday to HHS Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell. "I have repeatedly
raised questions regarding efforts by the Department of Health and
Human Services to prevent improper payments through the exchanges," he
wrote, saying his prior inquiries were insufficiently answered.
Portman cited two investigations into the government's
income-verification systems. The Government Accountability Office said
in 2014 its investigators secured subsidies using false identities in
11 out of 12 undercover attempts. Also last year, an HHS inspector
general report found the department "did not have procedures or did not
follow procedures to ensure" against government overpayments.
Others might have received credits in error because of poor system
safeguards, and Portman noted this risks "wasting billions in
hard-earned tax dollars."
Critics say there is still too little known about the effectiveness of
the administration's income-verification system.
Committee staff is also investigating the state-based exchanges.
Portman is requesting HHS name any state running an exchange that has
"stopped attempting to verify applicants' eligibility to enroll in ACA
[Affordable Care Act] health care plans or to receive ACA subsidies."
ObamaCare shoppers select insurance plans from state-run exchanges in
13 states and the District of Columbia.
Portman's letter to Burwell also references a 2013 federal regulation
that allowed, until this year, the administration to rely more on
applicants' submitted information than independent verification. That
reliance, however, is the foundation of much of the U.S. tax system,
noted one ObamaCare supporter and law professor.
Portman's letter to Burwell requests responses to more than two dozen
questions on the income-verification systems, how they performed during
the law's first year and whether any failings were resolved. Only the
committee's Republican majority staff is involved in the inquiry,
according to Portman. The chairman's letter asked HHS staff to respond
by May 29.

Bill proposed to rename VA clinic for fallen native
The Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Newark may be
getting a new name as U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman seek to
remember one of Newark's fallen heroes.
Daniel L. Kinnard, of Newark, died in Vietnam while tending to wounded
men in his unit on March 9, 1968. During his time of service, he was
honored with a Bronze Star of Valor, a Purple Heart and several other
awards.
Should the legislation go through, the outpatient clinic at 855 W. Main
St. will be named the Daniel L. Kinnard Department of Veterans Affairs
Community Based Outpatient Clinic.

Sen. Rob Portman tours Smale Riverfront Park, gets construction update
Senator Rob Portman paid a visit to Smale Riverfront Park Friday to get
a firsthand look at the project one day before a new children's play
area is set to open.
"I remember growing up, this was an area where there were a lot of
warehouses, some of which were abandoned," Portman said on his tour.
Now Carol Ann's Carousel, Anderson Pavilion, and a children's park
occupy the doorstep of Cincinnati.
The carousel has 42 hand-carved animal characters. The other
hand-painted panels include historic sites around Cincinnati, like Eden
Park, the Cincinnati Zoo and Union Terminal. The carousel will be open
year-round and cost $2 per ride.
The project cost $43 million in donated funds, and $15 million in
federal funding. It was also backed by the Army Corp of Engineers.
But it is not technically a parks project.
Instead, for funding purposes, the project is an erosion control and
storm water mitigation project.
Much of the development done closest to the river can actually be moved
if the Ohio River floods. The projects also have sustainable aspects.
"When you look at the economics of this and you assume you're going to
have a million people a year coming down here, the tax revenues that
will come from that just from people grabbing burger and a beer,"
Portman said.

Steadfast ally Israel prompts concerns but offers hope
I just returned from a trip to Israel, where I had productive meetings
with American and Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. My reason for going was to learn firsthand from those on the
ground the best way forward in a dangerous and volatile region.
Israel's greatest threat resides in Iran, a regime that has been
described by the State Department as the No. 1 state sponsor of
terrorism. According to the Obama administration, the Iranian regime
will be able to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear
weapon in a short period of time, while it supports terrorist groups
like Hezbollah and funds other Shi'ite militias as it seeks regional
dominance in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere.
Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I have serious concerns about
the framework of a possible Iranian nuclear agreement. Our objective
must be an enforceable agreement that keeps Iran from becoming a
threshold nuclear power. Any deal must include concrete and verifiable
steps to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability. There
are many important questions that are raised in the framework
agreement. In fact, the Iranian version and the U.S. version of text
seem to differ on some of the key details.
Attacks on Israel do not always come from rockets, missiles, or other
violent means, however.
Increasingly, opponents of Israel use economic weapons to target
Israel. The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is an effort to
undermine Israel's sovereignty and further isolate it from the
international community. Sen. BenCardin, a Democrat from Maryland, and
I recently authored the United States-Israel Trade Enhancement Act of
2015. It has a simple purpose. It says that the United States will
leverage trade to stop efforts to delegitimize Israel.
Finally, I talked to officials at length about the general turmoil in
the Middle East and Israel's relationship with its neighbors. This
deteriorating regional security environment includes Egypt's battle
against radicalism in the Sinai and a volatile Gaza controlled by
Hamas, the brutal civil war in Syria, the destabilizing role of
Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and Syria, threats and
challenges to our ally Jordan, and the brutality of ISIS.
All of this combines to bring me back to the Senate with greater
resolve to meet these challenges for our national security and for that
of our steadfast ally, Israel.

As
the
United

Portman
on
Wednesday
joined
Senators
Chris
Coons
(D-Del.),
Gary
Peters
(D-Mich.),
and
Kelly
Ayotte
(R-N.H.)
to
introduce
bipartisan
legislation
to
close
an
unintended
loophole
in
the
Public
Safety
Officers&#8217;
Benefits
(PSOB)
program
and
ensure
families
of
fallen
and
permanently
disabled
officers
receive
the
benefits
they
deserve.
Families
of
law
enforcement
officers,
firefighters,
and
other
first
responders
killed
or
permanently
disabled
in
the
line
of
duty
are
entitled
to
death
and
education
benefits
through
PSOB,
but
these
benefits
are
occasionally
denied
or
delayed
for
the
loved
ones
of
officers
who
suffer
severe
heat
stroke
or
over-exertion
in
the
course
of
duty.
The
Fairness

or
permanently
disabling
climate-related
injuries,
including
hypothermia
and
hyperthermia
resulting
from
official
duties
or
training
in
extreme

conditions,
are
deserving
of
full
recognition
under
the
law.
&#8220;Law
enforcement
officers
make
enormous
sacrifices
to
keep
our
communities
safe,
and
our
legislation
will
ensure
that
if
they
tragically
fall
in
the
line
of
duty,
their
families
will
receive
the
benefits
they&#8217;ve
earned,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
to
introduce
this

to
express
gratitude
for
their
continued

&#8220;As
we
recognize
National

the
Ohio
FOP
thanks
Senator
Portman
for
helping
to
ensure
that
families
of
fallen
officers
&#8206;get
the
benefits
they
deserve,&#8221;
said
Ohio
FOP
President
Jay
McDonald.
On
October
9,
2001,
Officer
Charles
McDonald
of
the
Forest
Park
Police
in
Ohio
tragically
died
following
SWAT
training.
A
medical
evaluation
later
determined
that
Officer
McDonald&#8217;s
death
was
the
result
of
rhabdomyolosis,
a
condition
caused
by
extreme
overexertion
where
the
skeletal
muscles
manufacture
a
toxin
that
destroys
the
kidneys.
Officer
McDonald&#8217;s
family
described
the
process
of
securing
PSOB
benefits
as
long,
drawn
out,
and
painful
&#8211;
a
process
that
involved
hiring
an
attorney,
obtaining
old
childhood
medical
records,
and
waiting
three
years
for
a
resolution.
The
Fairness
for
Fallen
Officers

would
guarantee
this
doesn&#8217;t
happen
again,
by
ensuring
climate-related

receive
full
recognition
under
the
PSOB.
Also
on
Wednesday,
Portman
urged
his
colleagues
to

boost
Ohio
steel
manufacturers
and
level
the
playing
field
for

On
Thursday,
Portman,
Chairman
of
the
U.S.
Senate
Permanent
Subcommittee
on
Investigations
(PSI),
announced
that
PSI
is
investigating
mismanagement
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
health
care
exchanges .
Working
to
hold
the
Administration
accountable
for
Obamacare
waste
and
mismanagement,
PSI
is
reviewing
whether
adequate
verification
procedures
were
in
place
to
ensure
that
roughly
$15
billion
in
insurance
subsidies
paid
out
last
year
reached
the
people
who
actually
qualify.
Portman
expressed
concern
that
reported
breakdowns
in
the
process
for
calculating
subsidies
have
not
only
been
unfair
to
some
consumers
who
bought
insurance
through
the
exchanges
but
also
put
taxpayer
dollars
at
risk.
&#8220;The
Administration
assured
Congress
that
the
eligibility
verification
process
for
the
exchanges
was
working,
but
millions
of
Americans
are
now
learning
that
they
received
overpayments
that
they
have
to
repay.
I&#8217;m
concerned
that
the
subsidy
eligibility
process
is
so
complicated
that
many
consumers
believed
they
were
receiving
cheaper
insurance
coverage
than
they
ultimately
got.
And
further
verification
failures
risk
wasting
billions
in
hard-earned
tax
dollars,&#8221;
Portman
said.
In
connection
with
this
inquiry,
Portman
sent
a
detailed
letter
to
HHS
Secretary
Sylvia
Mathews
Burwell
raising
several
important
questions
concerning
the
verification&#8212;including
questions
the
Administration
has
failed
to
answer.
PSI
also
issued
a
request
for
documents
concerning
the
reported
breakdowns
in
the
verification
process
for
state
and
federal
exchanges
so
it
could
conduct
its
own
review.

Also
on
Thursday,
Portman
announced
that
three
of
his
provisions
passed
the
Senate
as
part
of
the
customs
bill .
Portman
welcomed
passage
of
his
measure
with
Senator
Brown
to
ensure
steel
companies
can
more
easily
seek
help
from
illegally
undersold
and
subsidized
imports.
Portman
also
welcomed
the
passage
of
legislation
he&#8217;s
worked
on
with
Senator
Ron
Wyden
(D-Oregon)
to
crack
down
on
customs
duty
evasion
schemes
that
hurt
American
workers
through
the
ENFORCE
Act.
Finally,
Portman
welcomed
passage
of
his
bill
with
Senator
Claire
McCaskill
(D-Mo.)
that
reforms
the
Miscellaneous
Tariff
Bill
process,
building
on
his
efforts
to
create
a
level
playing
field
for
American
manufacturers.
&#8220;These
measures
are
crucial
to
American
manufacturers
and
steelworkers
and
ensure
that
they
can
remain
globally
competitive,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;When
competitors
cheat
they
need
to
be
held
accountable,
and
these
bipartisan
measures
will
do
just
that.
I&#8217;m
pleased
these
provisions
have
passed
the
Senate
and
urge
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
pass
this
important
bill.
&#8220;Further,
I
will
be
working
with
Senator
Brown
to
push
for
enforcement
measures
to
be
included
next
week
in
the
final
trade
package
that
will
be
signed
into
law.&#8221;
Portman
also
urged
his
colleagues
to
support
provisions
to
fight
human
trafficking
in
the
Trade
Promotion
Authority
legislation.
He
again
called
for
a
balanced
approach
to
trade
which
includes
more
exports
and
stronger
trade
enforcement
to
hold
foreign
competitors
accountable
when
they
break
trade
laws.

Portman
also
introduced
legislation
on
Thursday
to
ensure
that
Habitat
for
Humanity
affiliates
can
continue
to
receive
donated
appraisals
on
the
homes
they
build.
The
bill
makes
a
technical
clarification
to
a
Dodd-Frank
regulation
that
impacts
all
Habitat
for
Humanity
affiliates.
&#8220;This
commonsense
bill
will
ensure
that
all
Habitat
for
Humanity
affiliates
can
fulfill
their
mission
to
help
qualified
families
in
need
without
unnecessary
government
regulations,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen
firsthand
the
good
work
being
done
by
the
organization,
and
my
bill
makes
a
small
change
that
will
have
a
large
positive
impact
for
those
families
relying
on
Habitat
homes.&#8221;
On
Social

Senate
panel
probes
ObamaCare
aid
confusion,
as
customers
learn
they
owe
IRS
The
Senate's
top
investigative
committee
has
launched
an
inquiry
into
the
system
that's
supposed
to
ensure
ObamaCare
tax
credits
go
to
the
right
customers
for
the
right
amounts
&#8211;
amid
concerns
that
many
Americans
are
getting
inflated
or
improper
subsidies.
Sen.
Rob
Portman,
R-Ohio,
who
is
leading
the
investigation,
says
because
of
the
confusion
with
the
system,
millions
of
Americans
are
learning
after
the
fact
they
inadvertently
got
too
much
money
and
now
owe
the
IRS
hundreds.
"I'm
concerned
that
the
subsidy
eligibility
process
is
so
complicated
that
many
consumers
believed
they
were
receiving
cheaper
insurance
coverage
than
they
ultimately
got,"
Portman
said
in
a
statement.
Portman,
chairman
of
the
Senate
Permanent
Subcommittee
on
Investigations,
announced
his
panel's
investigation
in
a
letter
sent
Thursday
to
HHS
Secretary
Sylvia
Matthews
Burwell.
"I
have
repeatedly
raised
questions
regarding
efforts
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
prevent
improper
payments
through
the
exchanges,"
he
wrote,
saying
his
prior
inquiries
were
insufficiently
answered.
Portman
cited
two
investigations
into
the
government's
income-verification
systems.
The
Government
Accountability
Office
said
in
2014
its
investigators
secured
subsidies
using
false
identities
in
11
out
of
12
undercover
attempts.
Also
last
year,
an
HHS
inspector
general
report
found
the
department
"did
not
have
procedures
or
did
not
follow
procedures
to
ensure"
against
government
overpayments.
&#8230;
Others
might
have
received
credits
in
error
because
of
poor
system
safeguards,
and
Portman
noted
this
risks
"wasting
billions
in
hard-earned
tax
dollars."
&#8230;
Critics
say
there
is
still
too
little
known
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
administration's
income-verification
system.
&#8230;
Committee
staff
is
also
investigating
the
state-based
exchanges.
Portman
is
requesting
HHS
name
any
state
running
an
exchange
that
has
"stopped
attempting
to
verify
applicants'
eligibility
to
enroll
in
ACA
[Affordable
Care
Act]
health
care
plans
or
to
receive
ACA
subsidies."
ObamaCare
shoppers
select
insurance
plans
from
state-run
exchanges
in
13
states
and
the
District
of
Columbia.
&#8230;
Portman's
letter
to
Burwell
also
references
a
2013
federal
regulation
that
allowed,
until
this
year,
the
administration
to
rely
more
on
applicants'
submitted
information
than
independent
verification.
That
reliance,
however,
is
the
foundation
of
much
of
the
U.S.
tax
system,
noted
one
ObamaCare
supporter
and
law
professor.
&#8230;
Portman's
letter
to
Burwell
requests
responses
to
more
than
two
dozen
questions
on
the
income-verification
systems,
how
they
performed
during
the
law's
first
year
and
whether
any
failings
were
resolved.
Only
the
committee's
Republican
majority
staff
is
involved
in
the
inquiry,
according
to
Portman.
The
chairman's
letter
asked
HHS
staff
to
respond
by
May
29.

Sen.
Rob
Portman
tours
Smale
Riverfront
Park,
gets
construction
update
Senator
Rob
Portman
paid
a
visit
to
Smale
Riverfront
Park
Friday
to
get
a
firsthand
look
at
the
project
one
day
before
a
new
children&#8217;s
play
area
is
set
to
open.
&#8220;I
remember
growing
up,
this
was
an
area
where
there
were
a
lot
of
warehouses,
some
of
which
were
abandoned,&#8221;
Portman
said
on
his
tour.
Now
Carol
Ann&#8217;s
Carousel,
Anderson
Pavilion,
and
a
children&#8217;s
park
occupy
the
doorstep
of
Cincinnati.
The
carousel
has
42
hand-carved
animal
characters.
The
other
hand-painted
panels
include
historic
sites
around
Cincinnati,
like
Eden
Park,
the
Cincinnati
Zoo
and
Union
Terminal.
The
carousel
will
be
open
year-round
and
cost
$2
per
ride.
The
project
cost
$43
million
in
donated
funds,
and
$15
million
in
federal
funding.
It
was
also
backed
by
the
Army
Corp
of
Engineers.
But
it
is
not
technically
a
parks
project.
Instead,
for
funding
purposes,
the
project
is
an
erosion
control
and
storm
water
mitigation
project.
Much
of
the
development
done
closest
to
the
river
can
actually
be
moved
if
the
Ohio
River
floods.
The
projects
also
have
sustainable
aspects.
&#8230;
&#8220;When
you
look
at
the
economics
of
this
and
you
assume
you&#8217;re
going
to
have
a
million
people
a
year
coming
down
here,
the
tax
revenues
that
will
come
from
that
just
from
people
grabbing
burger
and

beer,&#8221;

Steadfast
ally
Israel
prompts
concerns
but
offers
hope
I
just
returned
from
a
trip
to
Israel,
where
I
had
productive
meetings
with
American
and
Israeli
officials,
including
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu.
My
reason
for
going
was
to
learn
firsthand
from
those
on
the
ground
the
best
way
forward
in
a
dangerous
and
volatile
region.
Israel&#8217;s
greatest
threat
resides
in
Iran,
a
regime
that
has
been
described
by
the
State
Department
as
the
No.
1
state
sponsor
of
terrorism.
According
to
the
Obama
administration,
the
Iranian
regime
will
be
able
to
produce
enough
highly
enriched
uranium
for
a
nuclear
weapon
in
a
short
period
of
time,
while
it
supports
terrorist
groups
like
Hezbollah
and
funds
other
Shi&#8217;ite
militias
as
it
seeks
regional
dominance
in
Iraq,
Syria,
Yemen,
and
elsewhere.
Like
many
of
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate,
I
have
serious
concerns
about
the
framework
of
a
possible
Iranian
nuclear
agreement.
Our
objective
must
be
an
enforceable
agreement
that
keeps
Iran
from
becoming
a
threshold
nuclear
power.
Any
deal
must
include
concrete
and
verifiable
steps
to
prevent
Iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
capability.
There
are
many
important
questions
that
are
raised
in
the
framework
agreement.
In
fact,
the
Iranian
version
and
the
U.S.
version
of
text
seem
to
differ
on
some
of
the
key
details.
&#8230;
Attacks
on
Israel
do
not
always
come
from
rockets,
missiles,
or
other
violent
means,
however.
Increasingly,
opponents
of
Israel
use
economic
weapons
to
target
Israel.
The
boycott,
divestment
and
sanctions
movement
is
an
effort
to
undermine
Israel&#8217;s
sovereignty
and
further
isolate
it
from
the
international
community.
Sen.
BenCardin,
a
Democrat
from
Maryland,
and
I
recently
authored
the
United
States-Israel
Trade
Enhancement
Act
of
2015.
It
has
a
simple
purpose.
It
says
that
the
United
States
will
leverage
trade
to
stop
efforts
to
delegitimize
Israel.
&#8230;
Finally,
I
talked
to
officials
at
length
about
the
general
turmoil
in
the
Middle
East
and
Israel&#8217;s
relationship
with
its
neighbors.
This
deteriorating
regional
security
environment
includes
Egypt&#8217;s
battle
against
radicalism
in
the
Sinai
and
a
volatile
Gaza
controlled
by
Hamas,
the
brutal
civil
war
in
Syria,
the
destabilizing
role
of
Iran-backed
Hezbollah
fighters
in
Lebanon
and
Syria,
threats
and
challenges
to
our
ally
Jordan,
and
the
brutality
of
ISIS.
All
of
this
combines
to
bring
me
back
to
the
Senate
with
greater
resolve
to
meet
these
challenges
for
our
national
security
and
for
that
of
our
steadfast
ally,
Israel.
(&#8220;Steadfast
ally
Israel
prompts
concerns
but
offers
hope,&#8221;

Rob
Portman.
