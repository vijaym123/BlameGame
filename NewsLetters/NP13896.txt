Yet Another
Delay
Just hours before Americans sat
down to their turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce, news trickled out
of Washington that the presidents massive health care law was
experiencing yet another setback.
This time, we learned that the
website for small businesses looking to purchase health insurance for their
employees will be delayed for a whole year.
In the
meantime, business owners will have to devote their time to filling
out paper applications or waiting on hold for someone to answer their
questions over the phone.
Thats simply not acceptable in this day
and age.
Its remarkable that after ramming the law
through with a partisan vote and some procedural gymnastics in late 2009
and early 2010, this Administration has had more than three years to
get these programs ready to go live
and yet it continues to look
stunningly clueless as delay upon delay piles up.
We knew the
Administration was not prepared for the implementation of this
enormous law; but this pattern of continued disarray is especially
disappointing.
In fact, this mismanagement only causes the American people
to doubt their governments ability to do just about
anything.
The question that remains is, what provision will be delayed
next, and how will it affect you and your family?
Only time will
tell, but given this Administrations track record, there will be more
delays and false starts.
These arent simply unintended
consequences; theyre the direct result of a law that is too big to
work.
At the end of the day, the uncertainty is causing continued
anxiety for the American people, and its as good a reason as any for
why the law should be scrapped altogether.

Sam Graves
