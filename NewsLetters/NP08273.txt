Upcoming Town Hall Meetings
Dear Friend,
I wanted to send you an email to remind you of my upcoming town hall meetings. All meetings are free, open to the public and no tickets are required to attend. I will be scheduling more of these forums across the district over the next couple months, but I've posted the information for the meetings tonight and Tuesday below. Tonight, we'll be discussing any issue important to your family. On Tuesday, the focus is on veterans and the issues within the VA. I hope you and your family can join me!
