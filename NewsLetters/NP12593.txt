Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I recently read
by Charles Murray titled "The Shaky Science Behind Obama's Universal
Pre-K
."
I was reminded of this article during the Committee on Education and
the Workforce hearing
on
Wednesday that examined the status and reform proposals of early
childhood education in the U.S.
I questioned witnesses during the
hearing on duplicative federal programs.
You can view that exchange
here
.
As Chairman on the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and
Secondary Education
, I am concerned with the education
of our young Americans.
Murray's article raised some concerns
regarding the early childhood proposals that the President made last
year ago and referenced in this year's State of the Union address.
Murray questions the effectiveness of federal intervention in early
childhood, and I share his skepticism.
His thoughtful analysis
concludes that the federal government has been unable to provide large
numbers of young children the help they need.
It's not a question of
money, as plenty is being spent.
It is a matter of ability.
During the hearing, I echoed this sentiment.
Many in Washington fail
to look at why policy failed.
Their solution is to simply throw more
money at a problem.
The true solution for helping families is clear,
we must empower parents and those around their children to raise and
educate them, not a federal program.

Protecting Second Amendment Rights
This week the House considered the Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement Act
, H.R. 3590.
Fishing and hunting are an important part of our heritage as Hoosiers
and as Americans.
The passage of this legislation will help protect
these traditions for future generations and prevent government from
attempting to trample the ability of Americans to exercise their Second
Amendment rights, and hunt and fish on public lands.
The bill also protects the use of traditional ammunition and fish
tackle - products under attack from government regulators - and
eliminates several regulatory red tape impairments to the importation
of legal hunting trophies.
The production of ammunition and fishing
tackle is a vibrant American industry.
This bill protects the industry
from potential regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency.
For
bill text and additional information on the legislation, please visit
the House Committee on Natural Resources website here
.
The bill
passed 268-154
.

Discussing Innovation and Education with Technology Leaders
In late January, in my role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
, I traveled
to Seattle, Washington to learn about some of the work being done by
innovative companies and organizations to improve American education
and economic competitiveness.
Rep. Rokita Visits Amazon HQ 1-24-14
While there I visited with a number of fascinating companies and
non-profits including the Washington Technology Industry Association
, The Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation
, Amazon, Microsoft and
Intellectual Ventures
.
I was struck by the
tremendous creativity and innovation at Amazon, Microsoft and
Intellectual Ventures, companies that are developing and deploying
technology that will continue to change how we live.
In addition to learning more about what each organization has been
working on, we also
took the opportunity to discuss the current state
of education in our country.
Like you and I already know, I
consistently heard that our education system must improve.
Far too
many opportunities are passing us by as a nation because we are simply
not preparing our children for the challenges they will face after
graduation.
Nowhere is this more clear than in the Science,
Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing (STEM) fields.
I believe our
ability to innovate is deeply rooted in our American Exceptionalism,
and education is a critical in helping Hoosiers build better lives for
themselves and their.
In education, that means providing our schools with the flexibility
they need to teach our children in whatever way is most effective in
their community.
It also means making sure that parents and teachers
have accurate information about the quality of their schools, no matter
where that school is located.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Discussing
Innovation
and
Education
with
Technology
Leaders
In
late
January,
in
my
role
as
Chairman
of
the
Subcommittee
on
Early
Childhood,
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education ,
I
traveled
to
Seattle,
Washington
to
learn
about
some
of
the
work
being
done
by
innovative
companies
and
organizations
to
improve
American
education
and
economic
competitiveness.
Rep.
Rokita
Visits
Amazon
HQ
1-24-14
While
there
I
visited
with
a
number
of
fascinating
companies
and
non-profits
including
the
Washington
Technology
Industry
Association ,
The
Bill
and
Melinda
Gates
Foundation ,
Amazon ,
Microsoft
and
Intellectual
Ventures .
I
was struck
by
the
tremendous
creativity
and
innovation
at
Amazon,
Microsoft
and
Intellectual
Ventures,
companies
that are
developing
and
deploying
technology
that
will
continue
to
change
how
we
live.
In
addition
to
learning
more
about
what
each
organization
has
been
working
on,
we
also
took
the
opportunity
to
discuss
the
current
state
of
education
in
our
country.
Like
you
and
I
already
know,
I
consistently
heard
that
our
education
system
must
improve.
Far
too
many
opportunities
are
passing
us
by
as
a
nation
because
we
are
simply
not
preparing
our
children
for
the
challenges
they
will
face
after
graduation.
Nowhere
is
this
more
clear
than
in
the
Science,
Technology,
Engineering
and
Manufacturing
(STEM)
fields.
I
believe
our
ability
to
innovate
is
deeply
rooted
in
our
American
Exceptionalism,
and
education
is
a
critical
in
helping
Hoosiers
build
better
lives
for
themselves
and
their.
In
education,
that
means
providing
our
schools
with
the
flexibility
they
need
to
teach
our
children
in
whatever
way
is
most
effective
in
their
community.
It
also
means
making
sure
that
parents
and
teachers
have
accurate
information
about
the
quality
of
their
schools,
no
matter
where
that
school
is
located.
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
Congress
and
for
supporting
my
efforts
in
Washington.
Take
care.
