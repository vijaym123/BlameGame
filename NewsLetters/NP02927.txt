Dear Delawareans,
Last week, the Obama Administration announced plans to allow drilling off the Atlantic Coast. I&rsquo;ve consistently opposed these types of proposals. They put Delaware and our neighbors at risk of suffering the same devastation and destruction that the Gulf Coast did after the BP oil spill.
Expanding drilling in Delaware&rsquo;s backyard is the wrong move for the country. And it&rsquo;s also unnecessary.
We&rsquo;re currently producing more oil, and depending less on foreign oil, than ever before. We should continue this progress by developing alternative energy technologies, such as off-shore wind power. This will help us address the challenges of our future &mdash;
combatting climate change, protecting our natural resources, and reducing dependency on fossil fuels .
I wanted to make sure you knew about this proposal and where I stand. Delaware&rsquo;s beaches are a destination for people across the world and an important part of the tourism industry in Sussex County.
Do you oppose drilling off
