Rep. Miller on 51 st
National Small Business Week
Rep. Candice Miller praises our nation&#8217;s job creators and highlights their importance to our economic vitality
Washington &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative
Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement praising America&#8217;s small businesses for National Small Business Week beginning today, May 12 th , 2014:
&quot;This year marks the 51 st
anniversary of National Small Business week when we recognize the contributions of the 28 million small businesses and entrepreneurs that spur innovation
and fuel our economy. Responsible for seven out of every 10 new jobs created today, America&#8217;s small businesses have accounted for 60 percent of all new jobs since the end of the recession.
&#8220;Small businesses are on the front line of our nation&#8217;s defense against high unemployment, and to ensure their continued
success, we must identify and eliminate the unnecessary and burdensome regulations that hinder growth.
&#8220;With over 9 million veterans and nearly 8 million women, our small business owners are proof that the American dream is
still alive and within reach.
Their contributions play a vital role to Michigan&#8217;s and our nation&#8217;s economic growth, and their success serves as inspiration to all American entrepreneurs.&#8221;
