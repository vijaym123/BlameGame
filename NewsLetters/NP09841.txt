Dear Friend,
Welcome to my latest newsletter. If you would like daily updates,
please follow me on Facebook
or Twitter
. Thanks for reading.
Rural Veterans Forum
I recently hosted a rural veterans forum at the American Legion in
Conway. Tammy Krueger, Director of the Manchester VA Medical Center,
Mary Morin, Director of NH Veterans Services, Dr. Richard Siemens,
Service Line Manager of Primary Care, Stan Solomon from Disabled
American Veterans Conway Transportation Network, and Bill Whitmore from
the American Legion all spoke briefly about the services they provide
before we heard directly from former service members and their families
about the challenges they face and possible solutions.
I also discussed legislation I just introduced that will help our
nation's service members and veterans:
The Rural Veterans Health Care Improvement Act
would give the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) the tools it needs to serve veterans living in
rural areas. More than 40 percent of all veterans enrolled in the VA
system live in rural areas. These areas, however, often lack quality
health care facilities and access to medical providers; my bill would
help the VA to change these problems.
The Service Members Student Loan Relief Act
would ensure that members of
the Armed Forces and National Guard in pre-deployment training can
defer their student loans for up to 180 days. Currently, the payment of
principal on student loans is deferred for service members during their
period of service and for the 180-day period after their demobilization
date.

Touring Pinkham Notch
I was very impressed by the working relationship between the
Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) and the White Mountain Forest Service.
On the visit, I met with hikers and toured part of the forest with the
Appalachian Mountain Club and the Forest Service. We talked about
ongoing conservation efforts and discussed the importance of protecting
our natural wonders.
Last week, I was happy to announce
that the White Mountain National
Forest will receive a $2 million grant from the Federal Highway
Administration to help repair roads and bridges damaged by Hurricane
Irene.

Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month
As we enter the month of May, the peak month for allergies and asthma,
I, along with my colleagues Rep. Engel and Rep. Cassidy, were proud to
introduce a bipartisan resolution recognizing May as Asthma and Allergy
Awareness Month
. One in five Americans
suffer from allergies, and more than 18 million Americans have asthma,
including members of my family, which is why I founded and currently
serve as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Allergy and Asthma
Caucus.
We need to make sure that everyone who suffers from asthma or
allergies knows how to identify, treat, and manage these diseases, and
we need to find a cure for all respiratory diseases.
Moms Clean Air Force
I was delighted to address the Moms Clean Air Force (MCAF) 2014 Mama
Summit
in Concord. Moms Clean Air Force is a
community of over 2,000 parents in New Hampshire, dedicated to clean
air and healthy kids. Moms, dads, and grandparents met together and
demanded action to protect the air our children breathe - both indoors
and outdoors - and called for action on climate change. You can read
more about the summit here.
Concord, May 6, 2014
Freedom Salute
It was a joy to join the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation at a
Freedom Salute to honor members of Charlie Company, the 238th MEDEVAC
unit, for their successful mission in Afghanistan. The 238th MEDEVAC
unit returned from Afghanistan earlier this year after deploying to
Afghanistan in July of 2013, where they provided 24/7 area MEDEVAC
support to coalition forces throughout Afghanistan.
During their deployment, Charlie Company soldiers carried 309 patients
to higher levels of care. They also received numerous awards while
deployed, including 3 Bronze Star Medals, 26 Air Medals, 16 Army
Commendation Medals, and 1 Army Achievement Medal. During Sunday's
ceremony, I was honored to recognize the soldiers and their families
for their heroism and dedicated service.
Concord, May 4, 2014
Affordable Care Act
The Affordable Care Act has turned a corner in New Hampshire. The
rollout was rocky, and I made my frustration well known, but it's great
news
that
40,262 Granite Staters and over 8 million people nationwide have signed
up for private health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act's
Marketplaces.
I've heard from constituents, both Republicans and Democrats, about how
the Affordable Care Act has helped them and their families. There are
still challenges, but this news is confirmation that access to
affordable healthcare has improved for New Hampshire families. You can
read more about the ACA enrollment numbers here
.
On Monday, I met with constituents who enrolled in private health
insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act at an ACA Roundtable at
Goodwin Community Health Center. I heard from newly insured families,
people with preexisting conditions, and local counselors who helped
Granite Staters sign up for health insurance plans.
We discussed the progress the Affordable Care Act has made in New
Hampshire, such as exceeding enrollment goals
, a bipartisan plan
to expand Medicaid to 50,000 Granite Staters, and news that two
additional insurers
plan to offer coverage
on New Hampshire's Marketplace next year.
Goodwin Community Health Center, Somersworth, May 5, 2014
POW Recognition Day
I was honored to speak at New Hampshire's Former POW Recognition Day
Ceremony in Boscawen. I was particularly pleased to thank four NH
former prisoners of war. I'm grateful for their extraordinary sacrifice.
Boscawen, May 2, 2014
Transportation Funding
Transportation infrastructure is an essential part of the New Hampshire
economy -- that's one reason why I support an infrastructure bank. With
the Highway Trust Fund scheduled to run dry this summer and with more
than a third of New Hampshire's state-maintained roads in poor
condition, I sent a letter
to the House Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee urging a full long-term reauthorization
bill to ensure that highways, bridges, and roads are safe and usable
and that the Highway Trust Fund remains solvent. In New Hampshire,
investment in infrastructure helps expand economic growth and supports
good, well-paying construction jobs. Additionally, it would make
desperately needed improvements to our roads and bridges.
Since the 1970s, Congress has traditionally passed multi-year
reauthorizations that cover five- to six-year periods. Such long-term
reauthorizations have proven critical to facilitating stability in the
construction industry. I have long championed transportation issues as
a Member of Congress, and I recognize the importance of transportation
infrastructure in New Hampshire.
Meeting with Granite Staters
As always, I was delighted to see many people from New Hampshire and
discuss issues that matter to our state. Here are some of them:
Thanks to Stephanie for presenting important research at the Council of
Undergraduate Research Forum. Very proud of her and the University of
New Hampshire!
Washington, DC, April 29, 2014
Thanks to the NH Fire Marshals for the work you do to keep us safe!
Washington, DC, May 2, 2014
I met with the ALS Association of Northern New England. ALS (Lou
Gehrig's Disease) is devastating and veterans are two times more likely
to die from ALS than non-vets. Let's fund research and cure ALS.
Washington, DC, May 8, 2014
I met with members of the NH Center for
Nonprofits to discuss their
work and some of the challenges facing their organizations.
Concord, May 6, 2014
Congratulations to Summer Hutchins from Manchester who won the NH-01 "An
Artistic Discovery" Congressional Art Competition with her pastel
piece, Snegurochka. Thanks to all those who participated and attended
the reception in Manchester!
