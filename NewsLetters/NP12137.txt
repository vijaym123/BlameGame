Despite disagreement in Washington on how to improve our economy, Montanans
can all agree on the importance of a quality education that provides
our children and young adults with the skills they need to be
successful after graduation and well-prepared to find good paying
jobs.
As a product of Montana public
schools, from kindergarten through college, and a father of four, I
understand the important relationship between a strong education and good
paying jobs. That's why I support policies that work toward both
goals, such as the
Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy
Communities Act . This bill allows counties to transition the
temporary Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program and requires revenues
harnessed through responsible timber harvests to be shared with the county
in order to fund schools and infrastructure. This legislation will
not only help create thousands of jobs in Montana alone, but it also
provides certainty to forest counties that rely on this critical funding
to support their schools-- an effort that earned endorsements from
both the National Education Association and the School Superintendent
Association.
Ensuring our kids
have access to a strong education is critical for Montanas future,
and that's why I continue to
fight
to secure
funding for the SRS program and work toward policies that provide our rural
schools with a consistent source of revenue by expanding responsible
timber harvesting.
I am
committed to finding solutions that not only strengthen our school
systems but also encourage job growth, but as your voice in Washington, I
want to hear from you on these important issues. Please take the time to
answer the question below so I can better serve
you.
Do you support
increasing timber projects to improve forest management and help secure
funding for rural schools? Yes - I support responsibly developing our natural resources to
provide revenue for our school systems No - I do not support increasing timber
projects Unsure *By answering
