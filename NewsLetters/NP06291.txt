Dear Friends:
Once again, it has been a very busy week in
Congress. We have marked important
anniversaries, such as six years of effort to get
the Keystone Pipeline application approved by the
President; addressed technology and privacy
issues; and worked on important legislative
issues such as emergency medical services for
children, and the reauthorization of the
traumatic brain injury program by the Senate
An important component of my job is to help
keep you updated on the work I am doing while
representing you in the United States
Senate. I thought it might be interesting
and helpful to you to provide you with links that
you can peruse at your leisure on these issues
and several others that are important to our
state and nation.
Thank you for your interest and support.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
