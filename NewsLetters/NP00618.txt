Blaine's Bulletin
There is no doubt that Memorial Day exists because the American spirit exists.
With that in mind, there is one story in mind that truly embodies the American spirit and persistence. Five years ago, I was approached by a constituent in my Washington, Mo. office wanting to tell her fathers story about his time defending our great nation in World War I. Her father, Sergeant William Shemin was in the 4 th
Infantry Division in the United States Army. And she believed that her father should be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in France in August, 1918. Sgt. Shemin selflessly exposed himself to enemy fire to rescue wounded troops and after all of his superior officers were either wounded or killed, he took command of his platoon and led it to safety, before he, himself, was wounded by a machine gun bullet.
As Sgt. Shemins daughter, Elsie, told the story of incredible bravery, I could visibly see how passionate she was about ensuring her father received, posthumously, the Medal of Honor. And while Sgt. Shemin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, there was never any explanation why he didnt receive the Medal of Honor
and I was determined to join her in this cause and see it through to the end.
As many of you know, the Medal of Honor is our countrys highest military honor and it is not awarded frequently. In fact, it requires an exhaustive review and approval process. Per the United States Army, Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave; and that courage must be well documented. As a result of the irrefutable documentation that is required, it is even rarer for the Medal of Honor to be posthumously awarded for acts of valor that took place nearly 100 years ago, because the military is not able to review Medal of Honor cases dating that far back without approval from Congress. However, after working to secure passage of legislation to allow for the review of Sgt. Shemins case, and receiving favorable recommendations from the Army and Pentagon, I can now proudly state that the President of the United States will award Sgt. Shemin with the Medal of Honor on June 2 nd , 2015, just shy of 97 years since that fateful day in France. While Sgt. Shemin was not able to receive this award during his lifetime, I take comfort in the knowledge that his daughter, Elsie, will be able to accept the Medal of Honor on his behalf and that we, as a country, can celebrate Sgt. Shemins lasting legacy.
While stories like Sgt. Shemins are truly inspirational, we shouldnt lose sight of the recognition that all of our countrys servicemembers and veterans deserve. There are men and women both out on the front lines and in supporting roles who we should give thanks to each and every day. It is because of them that we are able to enjoy the freedoms that we cherish so much.
Memorial Day is a time to remember all of our veterans and servicemembers who stood fearlessly in defense of our nation. It is a day that serves as a reminder to remember what was lost and what was saved. I cannot wait to welcome Sgt. Shemins daughter to the nations capital and to see her finally hold her fathers Medal of Honor, which is truly a dream come true for her.
