Dear Friend -
When the Supreme Court classified support for traditional marriage as motivated by animus in
United States v. Windsor , it
called into question
the ability of people of faith to freely express their religious views without fear of consequences. Recently, federal agencies have begun issuing memos and guidance that not only go beyond the scope of
Windsor , but also usurp the authority of Congress and the American people by skirting the democratic process. Here are a few examples:
The
Department of Labor
is forcing private business owners to recognize same-sex marriage in retirement plans
The
Department of Defense
is making discriminatory determinations for benefits
The
Department of Health and Human Services
is requiring private Medicare Advantage providers to cover the skilled nursing care of same-sex married couples
In response, I led a group of my colleagues in calling on the President to respect the democratic process he has sworn to defend, and uphold the right to free exercise of religion that this nation was founded upon, by rescinding the Agencies memos. Read the letter,
here .
Yours in Service,
Randy
PS
The redefining of religious freedom as a secondary right will directly affect you, your family, and your business. Read my thoughts
