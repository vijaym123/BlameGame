Keeping Texas Jobs and
Innovation at Home
I don't know about you, but I'm tired of
losing ground
to America's global competitors when it comes
to technology and innovation.
While China's percentage of
global research and development continues to increase exponentially,
America's share continues to decline.
In fact, experts predict that
China could surpass us by 2022 . That's
unacceptable
and I've been working for several years to do something about
it.
Last week, the House Ways and
Means Committee took a
big step
towards
fixing this when they passed out of committee my bill which will make
the
Research &amp;
Development Tax Credit
a permanent part of the U.S. Tax
Code. This permanency and modernization has a huge impact on
Texas energy, medical research, technology companies and
competitiveness.
This bill will make sure that t he next
wave of technology and manufacturing happens here in our state and our
nation
because it gives our innovators the certainty they
need to make long-term R&amp;D investments. I'm excited to announce
that the House will vote on my bill
this
week.
Reining in the
IRS
The House Ways and Means Committee also moved this month to hold former
IRS official Lois Lerner accountable for her
possible criminal actions towards American
taxpayers . At this point in the ongoing investigation, I
believe the
evidence is clear
that Lois Lerner,
at the bidding of political special interest
groups,
abused her powerful position at the IRS to violate the civil rights of
taxpayers , mislead Treasury investigators and risked disclosing
the private information of taxpayers that she relentlessly targeted
for their political beliefs. These are serious charges and we are
calling upon the Department of Justice to investigate and make it
abundantly clear that in America,
we will not tolerate the IRS abusing
its power to silence the voices of those who disagree with their
government.
Continuing
to Repeal the Affordable Care
Act
Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives took steps
to
repeal more sections of the Affordable Care
Act
and protect Americans from its negative effects. In Early April,
we started with
voting
to repeal
the ACA mandated 30-hour work week and
restore the traditional
40-hour work week
that
is the cornerstone of multiple employment laws. The 30-hour work week
hurts mainly women, young people and those without college degrees.
With families already struggling to make ends meet in this
disappointing economy,
the ACA shouldn't make it
harder.
In late April, the House
voted to repeal another section of the Affordable Care
Act
which is forcing U.S. jobs overseas and making it prohibitively
expensive for U.S. companies to provide quality health care for workers
posted overseas. When our Texas workers take a post overseas - in
energy, for example - it's already difficult to ensure they and their
families have quality health care.
The Affordable Care Act made it
even more complicated.
As complex as the ACA is in our own
country, trying to make it work in another country is an even bigger
challenge. This bill will allow Texas workers to maintain affordable
health coverage that's right for them, their families and their
companies.
Keeping Our
Promises
This
month, the House also passed an
appropriations bill
that provides
increased funding for veterans programs
and ensures that
active-duty military have the support and
infrastructure they need.
It is completely
unacceptable
that so many veterans are suffering while they wait
to receive their benefits due to a back-logged VA system. They deserve
the quality health care, job training and other programs that they
were guaranteed.
This backlog must end.
Our
world remains a dangerous place and I am so grateful for the
Americans who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to
ensure our freedom.
These men and women who took an oath to
serve and defend our nation deserve our respect, and the benefits and
support that theyve been promised. Congress will keep those promises.
Period.
