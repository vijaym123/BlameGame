According to
The Center for Regulatory Solutions , the regulatory cost per U.S. household is
$14,678 .
In 2012, the
median household income
was $51,017.
That means
the regulatory cost per household is nearly 29% of the average family income.
Recently, the House passed a package of bills, with my support, to address this over regulation, and instead focus on spurring job and economic growth.
The Achieving Less Excess in Regulation and Requiring Transparency Act,
H.R.2804 , requires the head of each federal agency to submit a monthly report for each rule they expect to propose or finalize during the upcoming year; requires agencies to choose the lowest cost rulemaking alternative that meets statutory objectives (while permitting costlier rules when needed to protect public health, safety, or welfare); requires advance notice of proposed major rulemakings to increase public input; and ensures that agencies fully analyze the effects of regulations on small businesses and consider ways to reduce unnecessarily burdensome rules.
Its time to cut the red tape and foster an environment that allows businesses to thrive and grow.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I will continue to
work
to reduce burdensome regulations on American families and small businesses.
