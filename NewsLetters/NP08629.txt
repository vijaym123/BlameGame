Dear Friend,
A sage preacher took the pulpit one Sunday morning to really lay it on his wayward congregation. His sermon was, in part, based on Ezekiel 38:20, &ldquo;I will pour out torrential rain hailstones, fire and brimstone...&rdquo; Flipping the pages of his Bible to the 13th chapter of Luke in the Christian Testament, &ldquo;There will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.&rdquo;
In the back of the sanctuary, an older woman stood and began laughing out loud, &ldquo;Praise the lord, praise the lord,&rdquo; she shouted. The preacher, who was thrown off his game by the woman&rsquo;s improbable and uncouth behavior, said, &ldquo;Sister, why don&rsquo;t you tell all of us what you find so funny?&rdquo;
She moved to the center aisle and said, &ldquo;Preacher, you had me going for a while until you said that sinners will experience gnashing of the teeth. Opening her mouth wide, she said, &ldquo;See, I have no teeth!&rdquo; The pastor was not amused, &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, we&rsquo;re talking God here, so teeth will be provided.&rdquo;
We all, you and I, seem to constantly search for unique little ways to exempt ourselves from the dysfunctionality of Washington. Please know, however, that we are talking history here, and blame will be provided.
When we only accuse the other side, we relinquish our personal power to change the direction of our legislative body. It&rsquo;s easy to accept praise from adoring political fans in our base. However, an extraordinary character is required to acknowledge our own role in the dysfunction and declare, &ldquo;I am a candidate for the teeth gnashing caucus.&rdquo;
