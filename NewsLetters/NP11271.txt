Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
After three weeks in Washington, it was great to be back in Central Florida spending time with students, business owners, and community members. I started the week by notifying Daniel Dennis from West Orange High School of his acceptance to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Daniels family joined me to surprise him with the announcement, including his grandfather who graduated from West Point 60 years ago.
On Wednesday, I visited Umatilla High School and shared
information about the congressional service academy nomination process
with the Junior ROTC group. I also spoke to their history and government classes, and answered questions about issues and what it is like to work in Congress. Current students are our future leaders, and I had the privilege of speaking at several schools this week, including:
-	The First Academy in Leesburg student assembly
-	Palm Lake Elementary School to honor one of their school counselors, Linda Martin
-	Polk State College to recognize their 50th anniversary and speak to their Student Government Association
-	Stambaugh Middle Schools 7th grade civics class in Auburndale

This week, I was also able to join several community meetings and events that focused on serving local needs. The federal government is a master at creating cookie-cutter programs with a one-size-fits-all approach, but they often miss the individuality that only local involvement reveals. I am grateful for the organizations that champion specific causes and seek to meet community needs, including the ones I visited this week:
-	Arnies March Against Children's Cancer with Arnold Palmer
-	The Kiwanis Club of Clermont
-	The Optimist Club in Leesburg
-	Boy Scout Golden Eagle Award Presentation to Sue Crabtree

As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in Washington, I am excited about the economic impact that the new Winter Haven CSX Intermodal Logistics Center will have on our local economy. On Thursday, I took a tour of the terminal and tried out the new training simulators that CSX will employ. This week, I also visited other businesses including:
-	9Round, a 30 minute kickboxing fitness circuit
-	Minuteman Press, a full printing service in Ocoee
-	EduMatics, a center where teachers and tutors focus on meeting individual learning needs
-	Winter Haven Chamber of Commerce, receiving an update from the new President Katie Worthington
This is just a sample of what I was involved in during my week in the district. To see more of my daily activities, you can follow me on Twitter

Congressman Daniel Webster . It is a pleasure to represent you in Congress.
Your servant,

Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
While filing her taxes online, a constituent from Winter Garden discovered that a return had already been filed using her Social Security number. Greatly concerned, the constituent contacted my office for help in receiving her rightful refund. My staff submitted a Congressional Inquiry on her behalf with the Taxpayer Advocate Service. Fortunately, the problem was quickly resolved and the constituent received the correct refund.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
On Thursday, an
article from USA Today

Legislative Update:
Last December, I supported legislation that the House passed to increase funding for targeted and coordinated pediatric medical research. This research will help improve treatment and find cures for childhood diseases like cancer, autism and Fragile X.
The funding for this initiative with the National Institutes of Health is fully paid for by terminating taxpayer funding for political party nominating conventions.
This legislation which I cosponsored, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act, was named in memory of an inspiring young girl whose story you can
learn more about here . Last week, the Senate finally took up this critical legislation and passed it unanimously.
While Congress may not always function as our founders intended, it was encouraging to see partisan bickering set aside in this instance to allow Washington to finally implement something so worthwhile and overdue.
