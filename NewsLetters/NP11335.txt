Greetings,
Nearly every week when I am finished with my duties in Washington, D.C., I return to Kansas to work and listen to constituents all around the Fourth District.
The flying isn't much fun, but I get to do so almost always on airplanes built or designed by great Kansas workers from Spirit Aerosystems, Airbus, and Bombardier, among others.
Once home, one of my great joys is being able to visit the next generation of Kansas leaders in their schools.
Just these past few months, schools Ive visited have included
North High School ,
Robinson Middle School ,
West High School ,
Andover Central High School , and
Trinity Academy .
What I hear gives me a great deal of hope about the future of Kansas and America.
I always learn from the thoughts and questions presented to me by these young Kansans.
They get ityou cannot spend more money than you have, great teachers matter (nearly every one of them has a best teacher story), and the need for good-paying jobs must be at the center of everything that government contemplates.
And theyre all proud of the freedom they have here in America.
It is my goal to get to every high school in all 17 counties of the Fourth District of Kansas.
If I've not been to yours or that of your children, give us a holler, and we'll work to get there as quickly as we can.
We all know that our future depends on us getting government out of the way and letting families and churches, local school leaders, and risk-taking entrepreneurs lead the way.
I look forward to seeing you in a classroom near you!
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
