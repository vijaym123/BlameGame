Dear
Friend:
Thank you for taking the time to read
my e-newsletter.
THE PRESIDENTS
HEALTH CARE "PROMISE"
President
Obamas health care law is, to put it bluntly, a fiasco. Despite the
Presidents promise that "if you like your health care plan, you can keep
your health care plan," people in Alabama and across the country are
losing their coverage and are finding that the available replacement
policies will be much more expensive.
With my
support, the House has passed legislation to help people keep their
coverage.
However, the underlying problem is that Obamacare is
fundamentally flawed.
It should be repealed and replaced with common
sense reforms that will truly improve health care
accessibility and affordability.

MAKING YOUR VOICE
HEARD
If you are among those whose
current health care coverage is threatened by Obamacare, a way to help
bring change is by speaking up. We are trying to demonstrate how this
law is specifically affecting the people of Alabama. If you have a
story to share,

BOOSTING SMALL BUSINESS
GROWTH
A big focus of my work on
the Financial Services Committee is trying to make sure that capital is
available for businesses to expand and hire more workers. The
committee just approved a package of bills building on the JOBS Act,
bipartisan legislation passed during my chairmanship that is helping
entrepreneurs and small businesses get needed financing. These new bills will
help further untangle outdated and unnecessary regulations holding back
economic growth.
REGULATORY
AGENCIES AND DUE PROCESS
Some
government regulators are getting into perilous territory by acting not just
as rulemakers, but as enforcers of criminal law. Citizens have found
themselves accused of "regulatory crimes" they knew nothing about and
often feel deprived of their due process rights. A special Judiciary
Committee task force that I serve on just held a hearing on this matter.
Proper legal protections need to be in place for our citizens because
regulatory agencies can wield enormous power without being
accountable to the public.
Congressman
Bachus is a member of a bipartisan Overcriminalization Task Force that has
been examining the prosecution of "regulatory
crimes."
CHALLENGING AGENCY OVERREACH
As the chairman of a regulatory reform subcommittee, I have many
questions about the procedure the Obama Administration used in
developing new climate change regulations. These rules will raise the cost of
coal-generated electricity and leave the U.S. more dependent on
volatile foreign sources of energy.
My concerns were
detailed in a letter I sent to the Office of Management and
Budget
and the OMB has since announced it will gather more views from the
public on this matter.
Also of concern are proposed EPA
regulations that would have far-reaching and very expensive consequences for
our local municipalities and farmers, among others, by giving the agency
the power to regulate even small collections of water under the Clean
Water Act.
U.S. Senator David Vitter, House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Bob Goodlatte, and I believe the EPA has overreached and we
are challenging the scientific justification the agency used to
support this vast expansion of administrative
authority.
BIOMETRICS AND BORDER
SECURITY
The use of biometric technology at airports and other
ports of entry to the U.S. has been promoted as a way to improve the
enforcement of our immigration laws and protect against terrorism.
However,
as I noted during a hearing ,
full implementation of biometric technology in the U.S. has lagged
unacceptably despite numerous statutes and recommendations made by the 9/11
Commission.
Seamless entry-exit systems can be installed with
greater ease and at less cost than ever.
It is time to set a
deadline to make this verification procedure standard for visitors to the
U.S. at all of our ports of entry.
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL VETERANS DAY IN
BIRMINGHAM
Birmingham has once again completed a moving
Veterans Day tribute. For this years observance, I was honored to work
with Congresswoman Terri Sewell and local veterans advocates to
introduce
a resolution recognizing Birmingham as a
national model for the commemoration of Veterans Day.
We live in
freedom because of the service performed by our veterans and our troops
now in the field.
They deserve our sincere gratitude and highest
respect.
