----- From:
Dick Durbin Subject:
All Gifts Triple-Matched (11/03/14) David, I need your urgent support. Here&rsquo;s why: -- The election is exactly TWENTY FOUR hours away
-- Cheri Bustos is running in a DEAD HEAT against her Republican opponent
-- Karl Rove&rsquo;s spending huge sums to smear Cheri&rsquo;s strong Democratic record This one&rsquo;s personal for me.
Not only is Cheri Bustos one of my staunchest allies, but she&rsquo;s a champion for Illinois families and a dear friend.
However, if Rove has his way, Cheri&rsquo;s re-election -- and our
entire
Democratic agenda -- could be doomed from the start.
David, not on my watch. I&rsquo;m in this fight until the bitter end. If you&rsquo;re with me, I need to hear from you today. All Gifts Quadruple-Matched Today Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
