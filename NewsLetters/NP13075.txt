The Time to Renew Unemployment Insurance is Now
Thursday, January 16, 2014
Dear Friend,
Late last month, unemployment benefits for an estimated 1.3 million Americans, including 58,000 Massachusetts residents and nearly 20,000 veterans, expired. I am among those who believe it is critical for Congress to work quickly to restore this vital assistance to help those who have been struggling to find employment in one of our most difficult job markets in decades. In addition to the moral imperative, economists across the spectrum agree that unemployment benefits are one of the best ways to spur economic growth - delivering $1.52 in economic activity for every $1 spent.
As such, I recently
introduced legislation
entitled the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act that seeks to provide a short-term continuation of benefits while Congress works on a more comprehensive solution. More than 160 of my colleagues have joined this legislation, and we are continuing to press Speaker Boehner for action on it. Seventeen times in the last decade Congress has extended such benefits (14 without any "pay-for", 5 of which were during the George W. Bush Administration) in a bi-partisan manner. Congress has never refused to act when unemployment - particularly long-term unemployment - has been this high.
Unfortunately, Speaker Boehner and his House Republican colleagues have not scheduled a vote this week on my bill or any similar legislation that would help unemployed Americans; and next week the House will not be in session. This is unacceptable.
I continue to hear from many in our district who share heartbreaking stories about how they lost their job through no fault of their own and cannot find new employment. Some have been searching for work for weeks, others for months. Those who have had their critical benefits cut are asking how they will pay their rent, gas their car, and feed their families. If you support restoring unemployment benefits to these workers and their families, share your story
here .
I will keep pressing for action on my legislation or any other responsible solution to help those in need. In the meantime, if you or anyone you know has questions about their benefits or is interested in learning about food pantries and other social services in our area, you are welcome to contact my district office at 978-531-1669.
Sincerely,
John F. Tierney
Member of Congress
