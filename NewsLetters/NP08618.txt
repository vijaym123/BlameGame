Missourians Speak Loud
&amp; Clear on EPA
President
Reagan once said that our Government's view of the economy could be
summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps
moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.
28 years
later, anyone who cashes a paycheck, files their taxes, or even picks
up the local newspaper knows that these words ring true just as they
did in 1986.
From Atchison
County, where I live, to Marion County clear across the state, I speak
with people who are worried about our out of control government.
Taxing, spending, and regulating is at an all-time high, and there
seems to be no end in sight.
Our government acts like everything
under the sun must be regulated, and all the bullying needs to
stop.
Few regulations are more damaging
than the EPAs proposed rule to give government bureaucrats in
Washington control over thousands of small streams, ditches, and ponds, some
of which may contain little or no water.
We are talking about
Missourians private property.
Just last week, when the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers came to speak
with Congress, I provided them with specific examples of how their
rule will impact North Missouri and called for an immediate stop to their
plans.
In Platte County, for
instance, property owner Steve Hall has been through a nightmare with
the EPA, which says he will need to fork over $160,000 for new permits
in order to build a small pond in his yard.
Too much is at risk, and as your congressman I will
keep fighting to provide Missourians with the relief we
need.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
