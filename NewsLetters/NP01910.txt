Rep. Veasey Commemorates Healthcare Achievements on 5 th
Anniversary of ACA
Washington, D.C. Today, Congressman Marc Veasey released the following statement in recognition of 5 years having passed since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law and the bipartisan compromise to fix Medicare payment and extend CHIP.
Today marks the fifth anniversary since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 16 million workers and middle-class families finally have access to quality, dependable and affordable healthcare.
Right here in Texas, I can confidently say that the Affordable Care Act is working to improve healthcare coverage for our state.
Since its enactment, not only are nearly 1.2 million Texans now insured through private health insurance plans, but it has also allowed those with a preexisting condition the ability to get insurance for the first time.
In the DFW Metroplex, an additional 34,467 residents got covered during the November 2014-February 2015 open enrollment period.
I firmly believe that healthcare is not a privilege; it is a right. That is why I will continue to work with my colleagues across the aisle to ensure that funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is extended and that we strengthen Medicare for our seniors by swiftly passing a fix to the SGR formula for physician reimbursement. The health of the nation and our state is so much more important than partisan politics.
