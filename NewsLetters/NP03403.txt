Dear
David,
I have heard from many constituents seeking additional
information about the executive actions on immigration that President
Obama announced late last year, and how they may be able to benefit from
them.
I am excited to share whatever information I can with the
community, and I wanted to let you know about an Immigration Workshop.
I will be there with Congressman Luis Gutierrez next
month:
Immigration Workshop
Santuario De Nuestra
Seora de Guadalupe/Cerrito de Tepeyac
Maryvilles campus, 1170 N
River Road, Des Plaines, Il
9:30 a.m., Saturday, February
14 th
The first hour of the workshop will include an
overview of the Presidents executive action and its impacts, in addition
to advice on how to avoid falling victim to fraud.
After the
initial presentation, the first 300 families who arrive at the event will
be able to sit down with a family defender, who will review the
eligibility requirements with them and provide guidance on how to get their
documents ready. I encourage anyone who is interested to attend this
event and to arrive early, as we expect a large
turnout.
With Congressman Luis Gutierrez discussing
Immigration Workshops
Dont Delay
Get Covered
Today
For those who still need health coverage, you
cant afford to wait any longer. If you sign up for a health plan through
Get Covered Illinois by Jan. 15, your coverage will begin on
Feb. 1.
I strongly encourage you to take some time today and
make sure you and your family has the health coverage you need. As you
shop for plans, please be aware that the ONLY websites where you will
be able obtain financial assistance to make health insurance more
affordable are
www.GetCoveredIllinois.gov
or
www.healthcare.gov .
In 2014, 77 percent of
Illinoisans qualified for tax credits that made coverage more affordable.
So far under the ACA, more than 800,000 Illinoisans have
obtained healthcare coverage either through the private plans offered
through Get Covered Illinois or the expanded Medicaid program. If you
are not one of them and you need coverage, you can act today. The
final deadline for open enrollment is February 15, but again
dont wait
to get covered.
If you obtained tax credits last year to
make coverage more affordable and were automatically reenrolled in your
existing plan, you should revisit Get Covered Illinois to update your
information to ensure that you are getting the accurate amount of tax
credits.
Lastly, Im sure youve heard that the ACA will
come into play when you file your taxes for 2014.
For
most of you, including those with Medicare, Medicaid, and
employer-sponsored coverage, all you will need to do is check the box stating you
have full-year coverage on your federal tax forms.
If
you received a tax credit for health insurance you will need the
information from IRS Form 1095
a form that you should receive in the
mail in the coming days
to fill out your tax forms.
If
you were uninsured for any part of the year, you will need to
complete IRS Form 8965 as part of your taxes to claim your IRS or Marketplace
exemptions from the individual responsibility penalty or to calculate
your penalty.
To learn more about how the ACA affects your
2014 taxes, please check out these
