Raising the Minimum Wage. It's Common Sense & Justice.
Dear Friend,
We need to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour NOW. By doing so,
we can bring one million Americans out of poverty, and according to the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), dramatically improve the lives of 25
million workers struggling to eat, have heat, and get by every day.
After signing a Discharge Petition to force a vote on our minimum wage
bill over leadership's objection, I reminded my colleagues it's a good
thing America is creating millions of new jobs, since many folks need
two or three just to provide a living for the families they rarely see
thanks to those long hours at work.
Raising the minimum wage is a matter of social justice - especially for
women who make up two-thirds of minimum wage earners, yet still earn
only about 77 cents for every dollar a man brings home.
>From an economic standpoint, it's just common sense. Minimum wage
workers spend their money at the grocery store, the hardware store, the
pharmacy, the car repair shop - on life's necessities. The result is
more jobs, more business activity, and healthier local economies.
I believe we are approaching the votes we need to pass a minimum wage
bill. I'll keep doing everything in my power to make that happen.
Meanwhile, please take a minute watch the speech below.
Sincerely,
"It's a good thing America is creating millions of new jobs,
since a worker needs two or three of them just to feed their families."

Introducing Relief for Duluth's Weary Road Warriors
The Winter Roads Safety Act of 2014 - before it even had a bill number
- on its way to the Clerk's desk.
Last week, with pedestrians and drivers on Duluth's main drag of
Superior Street still competing for space with mounds of frozen snow
and heavy logging trucks, I introduced legislation to fix this mess
through the winter.
The Winter Roads Safety Act of 2014, proposed along with fellow
Minnesotan Collin Peterson and Representatives Sean Duffy (R-WI), Reid
Ribble (R-WI), would grant a temporary exemption for logging trucks
that exceed federal weight limits to bypass busy downtown Duluth over a
short stretch of Highway I-35 until winter is over. Minnesota Senator
Al Franken plans to introduce the bill on the Senate side this week.
I'm working on a permanent fix, with an amendment to legislation
reauthorizing funding for federal surface transportation projects, due
to come up this summer or early fall. This amendment would provide the
Secretary of Transportation the authority to issue emergency weight
exemptions, similar to the authority our state governors have already.
Northland News Center caught up with us on Saturday. Here's the story
they ran
over the weekend.
Roads and Bridges Falling Apart. Anybody Disagree?
With more than 300 bridges certified as deficient in Minnesota's 8th
District alone, I posed three questions at the conclusion a House
Transportation Committee roundtable last week:
Does anybody disagree our highways, roads and bridges are crumbling
before our eyes?
Does anybody disagree this is costing millions of jobs and putting our
people at serious risk?
Does anybody disagree we need to find the money and marshal the will to
put people to work fixing this situation?
At the table were representatives of Unions, steel producers, the U.S.
Chamber, truckers, and other highway users, retailers, and
manufacturers. And not one person disagreed.
Meanwhile in Saint Paul, President Obama was announcing the
Administration's program to invest some $300 billion into rebuilding
our infrastructure, along with an additional $600 million for special
projects like the newly restored Saint Paul Union Depot, set to become
a major transportation hub for trains moving back and forth between
northern Minnesota and the rest of our nation. I commend the President
for this common sense plan to redirect our priorities homeward, create
jobs, and promote the public safety.
We've Got to Get Out of Afghanistan - And Rebuild America NOW
Reminding my colleagues in the House that the best source of revenue we
have for fixing our nation's crumbling infrastructure is to put an
immediate end to the war in Afghanistan.
When my House colleagues ask where we'll find the money to rebuild
America's highways, roads, bridges, airports and rail systems, I remind
them: In addition to the trillions of dollars we have spent over 13
years of war in Afghanistan, the Special Inspector General and 200
investigators are still unable to account for $60 billion U.S. tax
dollars poured into infrastructure projects never begun, never
completed, or blown up by the Taliban in that corrupt and dysfunctional
nation. Worse yet, another $24 billion is sitting in the pipeline,
certain to add to that terrible cycle of waste. We need to put an end
to this, and bring our brave troops home before one more American is
killed or injured in Afghanistan. Click on the screen above to hear my
speech on the House Floor.

Our Week In Pictures
With Tom Willette and Spencer Moon of the Carlton County Chapter of
Disabled American Veterans of Minnesota, in the majestic Library of
Congress Members Room. We're discussing the importance of turning our
funding priorities homeward to better provide for our veterans,
including fully funding medical and mental health care, job training
programs, and education opportunities.
With Cadet Lt. Colonel Noah Hall, Cadet Deputy Commander Katherine
Grotte of the Duluth Composite Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol, and
Cadet Senior Master Sergeant Justis Czarnik. They're showing me a copy
of the Minnesota Civil Air Patrol's Annual Report to Congress, and my
reviewing my cosponsorship of H.R.755, a bill to award a Congressional
Gold Medal to members of the Civil Air Patrol who served during WWII.
With Kris Rech of Hackensack and her daughter Alexandra, in D.C. as
part of their work with the Rare Disease Legislative Advocates
organization. We discussed funding research to fight childhood cancer,
as well as my decision to join the Pediatric Cancer Caucus.
Addressing more than 200 members of the Minnesota Police and Peace
Officers Association (MPPOA) on Saturday in Two Harbors, I discussed my
bills to help end the scourge of sex trafficking, as well as the need
to assure our law enforcement officers have all the tools they need to
do their jobs as they put themselves in harms way every day to protect
and serve us.
After a good discussion with mom about the need to raise the minimum
wage during an impromptu stop at Betty's Pies near Two Harbors on
Saturday, this young constituent just wanted to say hello.
_____
Briefly...
As the President prepares his budget to fund the federal government for
Fiscal Year 2015, I've met with interested constituents, interest
groups, and advocacy organizations out in D.C. to make sure their
worthy projects receive as much support as possible next year. Last
week I:
.
Sent a letter to President Obama requesting robust funding
for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund - to reimburse rural counties for
the money they would otherwise lose due to un-taxable federal lands
within their boundaries.
.
Requested full funding for the U.S. Coast Guard's programs
on safety while fishing.
.
Signed onto Rep. Keith Ellison's (D-MN) resolution to
designate March as Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) Awareness Month. MSA
is a rare neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive loss of
motor skills, and for which there is no known cure.
.
Cosponsored H.R.2315, the Preserving Access to Orphan Drugs
Act, to promote and encourage the development of orphan drugs - those
drugs that specifically treat rare diseases. I added my name to this
bill after meeting with Duluth's CSL Plasma, one branch of a global
biopharmaceutical company that collects and stores plasma in the hopes
of providing vaccines and curing diseases.
.
Joined Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) in urging the President to
fund research on the decline of our honeybee population. I've
consistently supported legislation to find out what's behind the
tragic, worldwide collapse of our honeybee colonies, and I hope the
President's budget reflects our legislative efforts, as well as public
demand and concern.

Finally...
Thanks for Your Mail - and Keep it Coming!
Our giant tower of constituent-mailed "Don't Tax My Credit Union!"
postcards in our D.C. office.
When members of the Minnesota Credit Union Network were in my office
last week, they were so delighted to see that teetering tower of
postcards that they tweeted
out the photo above.
Why? Because every single one of those cards was sent to Washington by
a constituent from the Eighth District who cares about their credit
union. Of course we have noted every one. If you have an issue or
concern, write me an email
. If you need help with a federal agency, stop
by
one of my Congress Comes to You
meetings. Your opinion and counsel matter to me, and help me better
represent the great people of Minnesota's Eight District.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Raising
the Minimum
Wage.
It's
Common
Sense
&amp;
Justice.
Dear
Friend,
We
need
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour
NOW .
By
doing
so,
we
can
bring
one
million
Americans
out
of
poverty,
and
according
to
the
Congressional
Budget

(CBO),
dramatically
improve
the
lives
of
25
million
workers
struggling
to
eat,
have
heat,
and
get
by
every
day.
After
signing
a
Discharge
Petition
to
force
a
vote
on
our
minimum
wage
bill
over
leadership's
objection,
I
reminded
my
colleagues
it's
a
good
thing
America
is
creating
millions
of
new
jobs,
since
many
folks
need
two
or
three
just
to
provide
a
living
for
the
families
they
rarely
see
thanks
to
those
long
hours
at
work.
Raising
the
minimum
wage
is
a
matter
of
social
justice
-
especially
for
women
who
make
up
two-thirds
of
minimum
wage
earners , yet
still
earn
only
about
77
cents
for
every
dollar
a
man
brings
home.
From
an
economic
standpoint,
it's
just
common
sense .
Minimum
wage
workers
spend
their
money
at
the
grocery
store,
the
hardware
store,
the
pharmacy,
the
car
repair
shop
-
on
life's
necessities.
The
result
is
more
jobs,
more
business
activity,
and
healthier
local
economies.
I
believe
we
are
approaching
the
votes
we
need
to
pass
a
minimum
wage
bill.
I'll
keep
doing
everything
in
my
power
to
make
that
happen.

hello.
Briefly...
As
the
President
prepares
his
budget
to
fund
the
federal
government
for
Fiscal
Year
2015,
I've
met
with
interested
constituents,
interest
groups,
and
advocacy
organizations
out
in
D.C.
to
make
sure
their
worthy
projects
receive
as
much
support
as
possible
next
year.
Last
week
I:
&#8226;
Sent
a
letter
to
President
Obama
requesting
robust
funding
for
the
National
Wildlife
Refuge
Fund
-
to
reimburse
rural
counties
for
the
money
they
would
otherwise
lose
due
to
un-taxable
federal
lands
within
their
boundaries.
&#8226;
Requested
full
funding
for
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard's
programs
on
safety
while
fishing .
&#8226;
Signed
onto
Rep.
Keith
Ellison's
(D-MN)
resolution
to
designate
March
as
Multiple
System
Atrophy
(MSA)
Awareness
Month .
MSA
is
a
rare
neurodegenerative
disease
that
causes
progressive
loss
of
motor
skills,
and
for
which
there
is
no
known
cure.
&#8226;
Cosponsored

Orphan
Drugs
Act ,
to
promote
and
encourage
the

drugs
-
those
drugs
that
specifically
treat
rare
diseases.
I
added
my
name
to
this
bill
after
meeting
with
Duluth's
CSL
Plasma ,
one
branch
of
a global biopharmaceutical company
that
collects
and
stores
plasma
in
the
hopes
of
providing
vaccines
and
curing
diseases.
&#8226;
Joined
Rep.
Marcy

I've
consistently
supported
legislation
to
find
out
what's
behind
the
tragic,
worldwide
collapse
of
our honeybee
colonies ,
and
I
hope
the
President's
budget
reflects
our
legislative
efforts, as
well
as public
demand
and
concern.
Finally...
Thanks
for
Your
Mail
-
and
Keep
it
Coming!
Our
giant
tower
of
constituent-mailed
"Don't
Tax
My
Credit
Union!"
postcards
in
our
D.C.
office.
When
members
of
the
Minnesota
Credit
Union
Network
were
in
my
office
last
week,
they
were
so
delighted
to
see
that
teetering
tower
of
postcards
that
they
tweeted
out
the
photo
above.
Why?
Because
every
single
one
of
those
cards
was
sent
to
Washington
by
a
constituent
from
the
Eighth
District
who
cares
about
their
credit
union. Of
course
we
have
noted
every
one.
If
you
have
an

If
you
need
help
with
a
federal
agency,
stop
by
one
of
my
Congress
Comes
to
You
meetings.
Your
opinion
and
counsel
matter
to
me,
and
help
me

the
great
people
of
