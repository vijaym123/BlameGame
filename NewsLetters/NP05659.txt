Dear
Friends,
What an exciting week it has been
in Mississippi after a
historic weekend of college
football !
Congratulations to the Mississippi State Bulldogs
and the Ole Miss Rebels on their big wins last weekend.
These
victories are not only great for Mississippi football but are also great
for our state.
Whether in a
football game or what you consider a normal day in life, the combined
impact of faith, family, and friends is important and powerful.
Recently, I was reminded of a Bible School lesson that I learned in the
third grade from Mrs. Barbara Faust at Fairview Baptist Church in
Columbus.
The lesson was on Psalm 56:3 which says, "What time I am
afraid, I will trust in thee."
I am thankful for those like Mrs.
Faust, who helped instill these values.
I am thankful for
friends like you.
For
Mississippians, faith is not only in our church, family is not only around our
dinner table, and friends are not only at our local coffee shop.
Regardless of which team you cheer for, one thing that we all have in
common is that the influences of faith, family, and friends go with us
wherever we go.
Even on the football
field.
Stay in touch
and God bless,
