Dear Friends,

The deadline for the first annual Congressional STEM Academic Competition, aka the House App Contest, is on

If you are a high school student living in the 14th Congressional District you are welcome to compete. You can create your own app or work in teams of up to four students. Please register at

I look forward to seeing your creativity translated into fine art or an app! This is a wonderful way to receive national recognition for your talents.
Lastly, I would like to share with you one more opportunity from the White House. If you are between the ages of 8 and 12 and are an aspiring chef, you can submit your favorite lunch recipe. Your parents may help you with the recipe. If you win, you will be invited to the White House for a kid&rsquo;s state dinner! The deadline is April 5, 2014 and you can learn all about this challenge

All the best,
