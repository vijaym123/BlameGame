We hold these truths to be
self-evident
Tomorrow, people across our country will celebrate
Independence Day, the anniversary of the day on which, in 1776, the
members of the Second Continental Congress approved the final
draft
of the Declaration of Independence,
creating
the United States of America.
After the adoption
of the Declaration, John Adams, one of the members of the committee
that drafted the document (Thomas Jefferson was the principle author),
wrote to his wife, Abigail, that he believed that Americas
Independence Day:
[W]ill be celebrated
by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.
It
ought to be celebrated by pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports,
guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations from one end of this
continent to the other.
For 238 years, our country has served
as a beacon of liberty to the rest of the world.
And while we
have confronted, over the years, our share of challenges, the American
spirit has always brought us through.
There is much to celebrate
tomorrow, and every day, here in the United States of
America!
The Shocking and Senseless Death of Three Israeli
Teenagers
I was deeply dismayed by the
discovery
early this week, in the desert outside Hebron, of the bodies
of Gilad Shaar, 16, Eyal Yifrach, 19, and Naftali Fraenkel, 16, three
Israeli teenagers ruthlessly murdered by members of the terrorist
organization, Hamas.
Naftali held both American and Israeli
citizenship.
This heinous crime only serves to heighten
tensions in a region of the world already wracked by too much violence,
anger, and hate.
The United States must continue to stand strong
with our ally, Israel, in the search for a lasting, secure peace for the
only democracy in the region.
VAs Series of
Unfortunate Events ( American Legion
magazine)
This months issue of the
American
Legion
magazine includes a deeply disturbing
story
about the many problems plaguing the Veterans health care
system.
I am hopeful that the newly-nominated Secretary of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, Robert McDonald, a West Point graduate and
retired Army captain, will use his extensive private sector experience
to shake-up the VA from top to bottom so that our veterans receive the
expert care they deserve in a timely
fashion.
Americas Tax Code Chasing Good Jobs Overseas
Ohios
Senator Rob Portman authored a compelling
article
in the
Wall Street Journal
outlining
the ways in which Americas tax code is driving businesses
and good
paying jobs
overseas.
He identifies some much-needed reforms
to our onerous tax code that will make the U.S. competitive with other
industrialized nations, keeping jobs here at home for
Americans.
President Obamas Foreign Policy:
Iraq
Washington Post
columnist
Michael Gerson
argues
persuasively that President
Obamas limited vision of Americas role in the world is failing its
first big test, as the situation in Iraq and across the entire Middle
East continues to deteriorate.
We must not repeat in
Afghanistan the same mistakes we made in Iraq. The last thing America and the
world needs is Afghanistan reverting to a haven for terrorists and an
oppressor of its own people
especially women
because the United
States failed to secure the gains it has made over the past 13
years.
Salute: Shimon Peres, President of Israel, Awarded
Congressional Gold Medal
I was honored to attend
the
ceremony
in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda last
Thursday at which Shimon Peres, the President of Israel, was presented
with the Congressional Gold Medal.
In awarding the prestigious
medal to President Peres (the first to be awarded to a sitting
President of Israel), Congress proclaim[ed] its unbreakable bond with
Israel and reaffirm[ed] its continual support for Israel.
The previous evening I had the privilege of attending a dinner
saluting President Peres at the Israeli Embassy in Washington. I think
Israels Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, put it best when he
said in his remarks at the dinner: President Peres is that rare
leader who is both a dreamer and a doer
talking about the future one day
and then making it happen the next.
Shimon Peres has
dedicated his life to the service of his country and the quest for a
lasting peace in the Middle East.
I salute him as a true giant of our
time.
Salute: New Jerseys
Signers
On July 4, 1776, 56 men pledged to one another their lives,
fortunes, and sacred honor as they adopted the Declaration of
Independence. Among the signers were five New Jerseyans: Richard Stockton, John
Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, and Abraham
Clark.
Today we tend to take for granted the success of the American
Revolution, but at the time the Declaration was signed, the odds for
success seemed very long.
Id invite you to learn more about New
Jerseys signers by visiting this website:
Their
stories
are fascinating and inspiring!
Salute: Sean
Maltby, Chatham H.S., winner of the House of Representatives STEM App
Competition
Earlier this week I was delighted to
meet with Chathams Sean Maltby, the winner of the 2014 House Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) App Competition.
The
competition was open to all high school students in the 11th
Congressional District and was judged by a panel of professors in STEM related
fields and a local CEO in technology development.
This competition affirmed my belief that New Jerseys 11th
Congressional District has some of our nations brightest young minds in
technology development. Seans entry displayed a software development prowess
not often seen in young students.
While there could only be one
winner, each app submission displayed the highest levels of creativity,
functionality and ingenuity in STEM subject areas.
Seans
app will be displayed on the House of Representatives website this
summer, along with the other winners from around the country.
Check
out Seans winning submission
here , I am
sure you will be impressed!
Salute: Team USA and Tim
Howard
New Jerseys own, Tim Howard, turned in an
impressive game in Tuesdays World Cup match against Belgium, setting
a new record for the number of saves in a World Cup match,
successfully stopping 16 potential goals.
This
compilation
from ESPN shows every one of Howards amazing
saves.
Although the United States did not advance in the tournament,
Team USA has much to be proud of!
One Nation. One
Team.
