Helping You
Cope with Flooding
As you know, Des Plaines,
Glenview and communities throughout our district experience severe flooding
almost every year. As a result, homeowners face huge bills and high
insurance premiums. Last week, I was proud to vote for the Homeowner
Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which passed the House.
This
legislation provides refunds to homeowners who have faced excessive
premium changes; protects against catastrophic rate increases due to
remapping of flood zones; reduces annual flood insurance rate increases; and
clarifies coverage information for policyholders. I will keep pushing
for this bill to become law to assist our homeowners and all
Americans impacted by this issue.
