Dear
Friend,
Today, join me in saluting those who
have made the ultimate sacrifice. With heavy hearts and a deep sense of
gratitude we mourn these women and men-- parents, children, and loved
ones who believed so deeply in the values and ideals of this great
country that they were willing to give their lives to protect it. We also
stand resolute in supporting the loved ones they left behind who
carry their legacy. While we can never truly repay our debt to those who
gave their lives for us, we must not forget what we owe to those who
have returned home.
Just as the military pledges to leave no
soldier behind on the battlefield, we will leave no veteran behind when
they return home.
America has a sacred trust with the men and
women who have served our country in uniform and we are dedicated to
doing all we can to guarantee our veterans have access to timely, quality
health care. We are making every effort to modernize the VA
healthcare system and ensure there are available facilities in close proximity.
Just last year Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act which established the Choice Card program to allow
eligible veterans to receive care from private, non-VA health facilities.
Our VA facility under construction in New Orleans is on track for a 2016
opening and will have the capacity to service 70,000 veterans with
the best possible care. I will continue to support and hold the VA
accountable for delivering on their commitments.
Education is the
cornerstone to enabling our nations veterans to find a good paying
job once they return home. According to VA data, 1.4 million veterans or
eligible military family members have been able to continue their
education thanks to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Service members are provided a
tuition and fee payment to their school on their behalf as well as a
monthly housing allowance so that they can attend top level colleges
and universities funds can also be used for trade schools, on-the-job
training, apprenticeships, and flight schools for those who choose to
pursue those routes.
After fighting for our nation overseas,
no veteran should have to fight for a job at home. Congress along with
the President have taken steps to help our men and women in uniform
find good-paying jobs,
from providing tax credits for businesses
that hire veterans to creating a Veterans Job Corp that helps veterans
find pathways to work protecting and rebuilding America. Recent jobs
reports show veterans are making progress in our economy but there is
more work to be done. Recently, the VA launched the Veterans Economic
Communities Initiative, an enterprise to improve education, training
and employment opportunities for veterans in public and private
organizations.
We have over 350,000 veterans in Louisiana and over
44,000 in the 2 nd
District who served our country with honor
and valor. As we join our fellow Americans to remember those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice, and salute those who have served our
country around the world, understand we will stop at nothing to provide
the quality of life deserving of those who defend our way of
life.
Happy Memorial Day.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric
Richmond
2nd Congressional District of
Louisiana
