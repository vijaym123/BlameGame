Dear Friend,
After a long, cold winter, its obvious that spring has sprung in the Garden State because everyone Ive met with has been so full of energy and excitement. There are great things happening in New Jersey, and I wanted to take a moment to fill you in on the very latest.
From the Cake Boss newest location in Bergen County to a pet boutique in Sussex County, its obvious that our state is not lacking ingenuity and know-how.
As I said at every small business I visited, I will continue to fight for lower taxes and less burdensome government red-tape to make it easier to succeed in New Jersey.
In addition to visiting with business owners, I also answered questions from middle school students in Demarest, joined the Knights of Columbus in honoring local volunteers and chatted with retirees in Newton about issues facing our country.
It seems to me that hardworking New Jerseyans all want the same thing: to make an honest living to support their families. That is why I support policies that create opportunity and freedom for everyone, while preserving the founding principles that make the United States the greatest country in the world.
Meeting with constituents and listening to your concerns is the most important part of my job.
If I missed you this time, please contact me
here to schedule a meeting .
It is an honor to serve you in Congress, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
