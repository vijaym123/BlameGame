A Plan to Balance the Budget
The House of Representatives recently passed a plan to balance the
budget by 2024 without raising taxes.
I supported the Path to
Prosperity
, which cuts $5.1 trillion in government spending over
the next decade and puts America on track toward paying off our
national debt.
The Republican plan balances the budget in just ten years without
raising taxes. The President's plan never balances the budget - ever.
And the President's plan includes one trillion in new taxes.
The Path to Prosperity repeals Obamacare and cuts government spending
by reforming entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Meanwhile, the President's plan continues this administration's
reckless spending that is driving America deeper into debt.
Under the administration, the national debt has increased more than any
previous administration-it now exceeds $17 trillion. No family, no
community, no country can sustain that kind of excessive spending.
It's
the road to bankruptcy.
The House-passed proposal is a step in the right direction, but more
must be done.
We must continue to reduce government spending and spur
economic growth to ensure that future generations of Americans are debt
free.
Prioritizing Taxpayer Investments
As Chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I am
leading an investigation into the National Science Foundation's (NSF)
use of taxpayer dollars to fund questionable grants. The agency
recently awarded $700,000 to fund a climate change musical called The
Great Immensity
. This just sounds like an immense
waste of taxpayer dollars.
Unfortunately, this is not the only questionable research grant funded
by the NSF. The agency awarded $220,000 to study animal photos in
National Geographic and nearly $350,000 to analyze early human-set
fires in New Zealand.
Taxpayer dollars should be invested in research that benefits all
Americans. That's why I introduced the FIRST Act
, to focus research investments in critical areas such as biology,
chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and mathematics.
Advances in these fields drive innovation, create jobs and keep our
economy strong.
Spending taxpayer dollars to fund a climate change musical raises
serious questions about NSF's use of taxpayer dollars. NSF needs to
remember they are accountable to American taxpayers. It is not the
government's money; it is the people's money.
Administration's Immigration
Policies Put Texans at Risk
A recent report
by the Center for Immigration Studies found that
immigration agents only attempted to deport one-fourth of the illegal
immigrants they encountered in 2013. Meanwhile, tens of thousands were
released back into American communities.
According to CIS, 68,000 of those released in 2013 have criminal
records. The ICE office in San Antonio released the most criminal
immigrants of any office in the country.
Nearly 80% of the criminal
immigrants detained were released back onto San Antonio streets.
These dangerous criminal illegal immigrants are likely to repeat their
offenses.
In 2012, the Congressional Research Service determined that
over 26,000 illegal immigrants were re-arrested almost 58,000 times.
Suspected crimes included theft, robbery, kidnapping and even murder.
The President's immigration policy threatens the safety of thousands of
Americans, including those of us right here in Central Texas.

A

the
Budget
The
House
of
Representatives
recently
passed
a
plan
to
balance
the
budget
by
2024
without
raising
taxes.
I
supported
the
Path

Prosperity ,
which
cuts
$5.1
trillion
in
government
spending
over
the
next
decade
and
puts
America
on
track
toward
paying
off
our
national
debt.
The
Republican
plan
balances
the
budget
in
just
ten
years
without
raising
taxes. The
President&#8217;s
plan
never
balances
the
budget
&#8211;
ever. And
the
President&#8217;s
plan
includes
one
trillion
in
new
taxes.
The
Path
to
Prosperity
repeals
Obamacare
and
cuts
government
spending
by
reforming
entitlement
programs
like
Medicare
and
Medicaid.
Meanwhile,
the
President&#8217;s
plan
continues
this
administration&#8217;s
reckless
spending
that
is
driving
America
deeper
into
debt.
Under
the
administration,
the
national
debt
has
increased
more
than
any
previous
administration&#8212;it
now
exceeds
$17
trillion.
No
family,
no
community,
no
country
can
sustain
that
kind
of
excessive
spending.
It&#8217;s
the
road
to
bankruptcy.
The
House-passed
proposal
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction,
but
more
must
be
done.
We
must
continue
to
reduce
government
spending
and
spur
economic
growth
to
ensure
that
future
generations
of
Americans
are
debt
free.
Prioritizing
Taxpayer
Investments
As
Chairman
of
the
Science,
Space,
and
Technology
Committee,
I
am
leading
an
investigation
into
the
National
Science
Foundation&#8217;s
(NSF)
use
of
taxpayer
dollars
to
fund
questionable
grants.
The
agency
recently
awarded
$700,000
to
fund
a
climate
change
musical
called
The
Great
Immensity .
This
just
sounds
like
an
immense
waste
of
taxpayer
dollars.
Unfortunately,
this
is
not
the
only
questionable
research
grant
funded
by
the
NSF.
The
agency
awarded
$220,000
to
study
animal
photos
in
National

and
nearly
$350,000
to
analyze
early

in
New

Taxpayer

should
be

in

That&#8217;s

I
introduced
the
FIRST

and
keep

strong.
Spending
taxpayer
dollars
to
fund
a
climate
change
musical
raises
serious
questions
about
NSF&#8217;s
use
of
taxpayer
dollars. NSF
needs
to
remember
they
are
accountable
to
American
taxpayers.
It
is
not
the
government's
money;
it
is
the
people's
money.
Administration&#8217;s

Put
Texans
at

A

by
the
Center

found
that
immigration

only
attempted
to
deport
one-fourth

Meanwhile,
tens
of
thousands
were
released
back
into
American
communities.
According
to
CIS,
68,000
of
those
released
in
2013
have
criminal
records.
The
ICE
office
in
San
Antonio
released
the
most
criminal
immigrants
of
any
office
in
the
country.
Nearly
80%
of

These
dangerous

The

threatens
the

of
thousands
of
Americans,
including
those
of
us
right
here
in
Central
Texas.
