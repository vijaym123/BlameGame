Did You Know?
Happy Father's Day to all the dads raising the next generation of Americans who will keep our nation strong and free!
Dear Friend,
This is troubling:
59 percent of veterans recently said that their understanding of available VA benefits was a little or not at all.
That must change. Veterans, through your service to our country you have earned your benefits, and as your representative, part of my job is ensuring you have the information you need to take advantage of them.
Have trouble applying for any of these benefits?
Thats where we come in.
Contact us
any time for help with the VA or any federal agency.
Here are six things the VA may be able to do for you:
1. Help with Care for Aging Veterans
Are you caring for an elderly veteran?
The Aid &amp; Attendance and Housebound Improved Pension
program can cover the costs of caregivers in the home (including sons and daughters who are paid to be caregivers) or be used for assisted living or a nursing home.
With the ability for couples to receive up to $25,020 a year, the Aid &amp; Attendance benefit will help take care of a significant portion of long-term care costs. Surviving spouses of veterans are also eligible to receive up to $13,560 a year to cover their long-term care costs.

2. Help with Substance Abuse
Veterans eligible for VA medical care may apply for substance abuse treatment. Services include evaluation, detoxification, residential rehabilitation and outpatient treatment. Veterans without service-connected disabilities whose incomes exceed the threshold for free care may be authorized for treatment if the veteran agrees to make a co-payment.

3. Housing Assistance
The VAs
Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program
(SSVF) provides grants to community non-profit organizations to assist homeless veterans or veteran families who are at risk of losing their housing. SSVF grantees provide time-limited payments to third-parties
including landlords, utility companies, moving companies, and child care providers
to help veteran families stay in or acquire permanent housing. This temporary financial assistance can be used to meet a variety of needs. For example, it can be used for security deposits or move-in expenses. Click

4. Access to Jobs
The Veterans Preference
program gives special consideration to eligible veterans looking for federal employment. Veterans who are disabled or who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns are entitled to preference over similarly qualified non veterans, both in hiring into the federal civil service and in retention during reductions in force.

Additionally, American Corporate Partners connects veterans with top companies to help them obtain a job after their time of service. Along with being connected to job opportunities, veterans have the opportunity to receive one-on-one mentoring and other career development services.

5. Job Certification and Training
Veterans may receive vocational rehabilitation and employment services to help with job training, employment accommodations, resume development, and skills coaching. Other services may be provided to assist veterans in starting their own businesses or independent living services for those who are severely disabled and unable to work in traditional employment.

6. Help Buying a Home
The VA provides a home loan guarantee benefit and other housing-related programs to help you buy, build, repair, retain, or adapt a home for your own personal occupancy. The loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. The VA guarantees a portion of the loan, enabling the lender to provide you with more favorable terms. Click

Where Have You Been, Scott?
Scott recently attended an event hosted by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Midway, one of the greatest Naval victories in American history. Six veterans from the Battle attended as honored guests. Did you know that Scott's father, Ike Rigell, served our nation as an Iwo Jima Marine? He was on Midway the day the Battle of Midway unfolded. Next time you see Scott - ask him to tell you more!
On Memorial Day, Scott spoke at the Norfolk Memorial Day Ceremony and Trail of Honor Dedication. The Trail of Honor, now displayed in downtown Norfolk on Wisconsin Square, is a tribute to the nine Norfolk native or resident service members who were awarded the Medal of Honor since the Civil War.
These two men truly know the meaning of the word 'sacrifice.' CAPT Mulligan (seated closest to Scott) is a veteran of WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, and was a Prisoner Of War (POW) for 7 years. The gentleman seated on the opposite side of CAPT Mulligan, George Coker, was also a POW in Vietnam.
