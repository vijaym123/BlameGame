Dear Friend,
Welcome to my
Congress in your Inbox
e-Newsletter. In recent weeks, President
Obama, Congress and the American people have been engaged in a dialogue
about the challenges in the Middle East, including the threat from the
terrorist group ISIL. Last week,
Congress held a
vote
to authorize the President's request to equip and train certain
Syrian groups in the fight against ISIL and this week U.S. airstrikes
began in Syria. I voted against last week's vote because I believe it
was a back door vote that has the potential to lead to an
expanded and open-ended commitment. This past
July, Congress demonstrated in a bipartisan way that the President
needs to seek broader Congressional authorization before proceeding with
military action in Iraq and Syria and I oppose further military
actions without Congressional authorization. Given the seriousness of the
many questions that are being asked by both Republicans and Democrats,
we must have the opportunity to fully discuss and robustly debate the
Administrations overarching strategy.
In this weeks edition of
Congress in
your Inbox
you can watch video of my interview with Jim
Braude on
NECNs Broadside
about U.S. military
action in Iraq and Syria.
I am also
interested in your thoughts; please consider taking the survey
located at the bottom of the newsletter
about your thoughts on President Obamas plan to combat ISIL
.
Closer to home, every year I host River Day, a
celebration of the waterways that connect the Third Congressional District
and a chance to promote conservation and clean-up efforts. This
year marked the
8th annual River Day , held in
Lawrence, Stow and Fitchburg on Saturday, September 13. Read more about
River Day below and check out some great photos from each stop. You can
also find information about the need to
renew
unemployment insurance and the lowering of Medicare spending .
As
always, I look forward to your feedback at my
website , or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Thanks for staying engaged and enjoy this week's
edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki

statement on President's request to train and equip Syrian
groups
September 17, 2014
Many significant questions
remain regarding the cost, the commitment of American servicemembers,
the timetable, the nature of the support we have from regional
partners who must take more direct responsibility, the exit strategy, and how
we will define success, to name a few ...
