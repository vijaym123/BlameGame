The Scalise Capitol Report
Monday, May 12,
2014
Standing for
opportunity and choice in education
High-quality charter schools are producing great results
and providing educational opportunities for students and parents
across the country.
Last week, the House passed important
legislation to encourage the establishment of new charter schools and expand and
replicate existing high-quality charters.
Charter schools have
played a key role in the educational transformation that has taken
place in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina, and I am proud to support
this common-sense bipartisan bill.
I recently toured Hynes
Charter School in New Orleans and saw first-hand the positive impact
charters are having on our kids and community.
I am confident this
effort to promote innovation, flexibility, quality, and choice will
continue yielding positive results and give even more students, many of whom
are educationally disadvantaged and stuck in failing schools, the
opportunity to attend high-quality institutions.
Choice in
education is key to providing students and parents with the hope and
opportunity that they deserve, and this bill is a significant step in that
direction.

Holding Lois Lerner in contempt of
Congress
The House held former IRS official Lois
Lerner in contempt of Congress last week for refusing to comply with a
subpoena issued by the Oversight Committee.
Make no mistake, she
abused her power by using the heavy hand of the IRS to target certain
civic groups, and then refused to answer for her actions.
I
applaud the efforts of Chairman Issa and his committee as they continue
to hold this Administration accountable for targeting American citizens
based solely on their political views.
Establishing a Benghazi Select
Committee
Weve now
established a Select Committee to finally get answers to the events
surrounding the terrorist attack in Benghazi.
There is a serious need for
transparency and accountability regarding the attack in Benghazi on
September 11, 2012, that took the lives of four brave Americans.
The Obama Administration has failed to account for their lack of
action before, during, and after the attack on our consulate, and we need
to uncover the facts and get answers to the serious questions that have
been raised.
I am confident in Congressman Trey Gowdy's ability
as Chairman to lead this investigation in a fair and judicious
manner, and I look forward to the Select Committees work to provide answers
to the victims families and the American
people.
It is an honor to represent you in
Congress.
