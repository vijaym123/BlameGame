Friend,
Did you get a chance to read Ami&#39;s email yesterday? It&#39;s true - 2014 is just a day away, and we&#39;re up against an important deadline. We&#39;ve come close to meeting our goal, but we&#39;re not quite there yet.
Whether or not we meet this goal will determine how much we can accomplish in January-- and trust us, we have a lot to do.
The pressure is on, and Ami is counting on us--
can you help us out by chipping in $5, $10, or whatever you can afford?
In order for us to succeed in 2014, we need your help as we close the books on 2013. You&#39;ve always been there in the past, and we know we can count on you now.
Thanks for all you do-- and happy new year!
Team B era
P.S.
It&#39;s our last deadline of 2013, and the timer runs out at midnight.
Will you click here to pitch in a few dollars right now?
