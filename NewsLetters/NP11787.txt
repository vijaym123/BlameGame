Last month, I met with my Farmers Advisory Board at the Virginia Diner in Wakefield to discuss a wide range of issues impacting the agriculture community in the 4th Congressional District of Virginia. We covered the passage of the Farm Bill and what that means for farmers - from five years of stability for the agriculture community, to the crucial role that nutrition reform plays in the overall bill. Additionally, I heard farmers concerns about EPA regulations and the increased federal presence into Americans' personal lives and livelihoods, as well as the call for comprehensive tax reform to alleviate unnecessary burdens on farmers and small business owners. I appreciate the time each one of them took to come meet with me and share their ideas, feedback, and perspective on these important issues confronting the agriculture industry in Virginia.
