Dear Friend,
Last week, I joined 331 of my colleagues in the House in providing
fiscal stability and certainty for our men and women in uniform by
supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2013.
There was good and bad in this legislation. However,
my number one priority is to protect our nations security. President
Obamas reckless budget cuts are hurting our nations security today.
These cuts have led to our friends and neighbors being furloughed and
laid off, have impacted training our
warfighters
and are inhibiting our ability
to attract defense industry to our area. Right now, soldiers at Ft.
Carson who are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan are getting less
training than in previous years. Less training means a higher risk that
these men and women in uniform will suffer while in harms
way.
Over all this hangs the
uncertainty of what may come next as the DOD would make deeper and deeper
cuts in the years to come. The fact remains that we live in a dangerous
world. Our military commanders, in Washington and here in Colorado
Springs, have personally shared with me the critical need to end the
national security cuts as soon as
possible.
That is why I have used my position on the House
Armed Services Committee to be a tireless advocate for our five
regional military installations. It is why I voted against the
Draconian
defense cuts put
in place by the Budget Control Act of 2011. And it is why I voted to
support the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2013.
Also, through this deal the deficit is
reduced by $23 billion, which while only a small step, is more relief
than we obtained during the budget showdown in October. This reduction is
being made without raising taxes. The main part of the sequestration
caps, apart from higher defense spending, will remain in
place.
It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's
Happening?

On
Saturday, December
14th ,
it was an honor
to present a POW Medal to the family of Korean War
veteran Colonel Bill Moore on behalf of a grateful nation. He was
imprisoned for 33 months by Chinese forces and served as an inspiration to
countless individuals during his time serving our country. Thank you to
Colonel Moore's family and friends who joined us for this special
ceremony!
Another
fantastic part of this ceremony was the chance to meet World War II
POW Ed Beck. Mr. Beck was captured by the Nazis during the Battle of the
Bulge.
Mr. Beck and many other veterans took the time to join us in showing
support for Colonel Moore's family. As the son of a World War II
veteran, it was an honor and a privilege to meet Mr.
Beck.

and distributed right here in the Fifth Congressional

What Say You?
One of the most
important things I can do is listen to my constituents. My staff and I get
thousands of phone calls, emails, letters, and social media postings
every week. Here is a sampling of what you are
saying.
On
my Facebook
this week many
citizens weighed in with what they would ask Secretary of Health and

I have MS and am living on SSI DI. I have Medicaid and it is
very difficult to find a Neurologist who will accept it now. How bad
will my chances of receiving the health care I need going to be now
that almost 15,000,000 people may be added to the Medicaid
program?
