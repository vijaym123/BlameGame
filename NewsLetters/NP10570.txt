Transition extension bill to get hearing
The House Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans, and Insular Areas has announced an April 29 hearing on H.R.4296 , my bill to extend the current immigration transition period in the Northern Marianas from 2014 to 2019. We need the additional five years to train local workers to fill the jobs now held by approximately 9,600 foreign workers. During the extension the number of Commonwealth-only (CW) Transitional Workers will still have to go down each year until reaching zero in 2019. The transition extension also allows 261 foreign investors to continue in business until 2019 and maintains the existing exemption for the Northern Marianas and Guam from the national cap on H visa holders. H visas are for temporary foreign workers in temporary job, such as construction. Throughout the transition the NMI is also protected from asylum seekers, which has been important to our reviving tourism industry. On a parallel track the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has already filed a favorable report on S.1237 , the Omnibus Territories Act, containing the same language as H.R.4296 . The Senate could vote on its bill at any time. Anyone wishing to submit testimony for the hearing on H.R.4296
may send it to kilili@mail.house.gov or to one of the local congressional offices.

Student Lica Ishida invited me to listen in on a debate in her AP Language Arts class at Saipan Southern High School this week. Students argued the pros and cons of extending the immigration transition period created by the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. I will certainly keep their ideas in mind when my bill extending the transition, H.R. 4296, gets a hearing on April 29. Thanks to Language Arts teacher Jonathan Aguon and all the AP Manta Rays for their good work.

Constituents frequently ask me about faded highway marking, so it was great to see the CNMI Department of Public Works, RNV Construction, and the Federal Highway Administration breaking ground on a project to improve striping and signage along Chalan Monsignor Guerrero Road this week. Thats Governor Eloy Inos test-driving the equipment. Congress authorizes $4 million annually for Northern Marianas road projects. Reduced collections of federal gas taxes has meant a 20 percent cut for all states and territories in recent years, but the Commonwealth still has a backlog of unspent funds.
