This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in
Town of Greece v. Galloway , a case challenging the constitutionality of prayer before town meetings.
Since 1999, the town of Greece, New York has had a policy allowing members of the local clergy or local residents who wish to offer a prayer at the beginning of town council meetings to request to do so.
Two residents of the town filed a lawsuit challenging the policy as unconstitutional, saying they felt coerced to participate in the prayers and believed the prayers were primarily Christian.
Thirty years ago, the Court recognized that opening of sessions of legislative and other deliberative public bodies with prayer is deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country.
In doing so, the Court ruled that prayer before such meetings is constitutional as long as it does not serve to proselytize or disparage any faith or belief.
Question of the week:
Do you believe that it is constitutional for government meetings
whether local, state or federal
to be opened with prayer?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
