U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis and legislation he introduced to incentivize small businesses to hire our nation's veterans were fe atured in this week's Republican address. The

The bill incentivizes small businesses to hire veterans by exempting veterans who already receive health insurance through the Department of Veterans Affairs or reservists covered under TRICARE from being counted towards the number of employees required by the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. The employer mandate is a requirement that all businesses with more than 50 full-time employees provide health insurance to their employees or pay a fee.
The legislation had 37 co-sponsors and is supported by the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States (EANGUS), the only military service association representing the interests of every enlisted soldier and airmen in the Army and Air National Guard, and The Retired Enlisted Association, a Congressionally-charted veterans service organization and the largest association in the nation of enlisted retirees and veterans from all branches of the Armed Forces.
In this weeks Republican address, the authors of more than a dozen House-passed jobs bills, including Rep. Davis, called on President Obama and Senate Democrats to act and match the Houses focus on the economy.
