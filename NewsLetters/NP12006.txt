Dear Friend,
This week marks an important anniversary. Five years ago, Americans in
cities across the country gathered with a collective rallying cry - we
are Taxed Enough Already. The Tea Party was born.
With every new bill that threatened to expand the size of government's
interference in the public's lives, thousands upon thousands would flock
to the streets in protest, acting as the conscience of the Constitution.
As chairwoman of the House Tea Party Caucus, I am honored to be part of
such a profound movement to maintain a focus on our nation's founding
documents. In a recent op-ed
, I look back on the past five years of the
Tea Party.
Recap: Coffee with your Congresswoman
On February 13 and 15, I had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of
Sixth District constituents in St. Cloud, Forest Lake and Buffalo. I
want to thank everyone who joined me for coffee and took time out of
their busy schedules to share with me their individual stories and
concerns. To see pictures and highlights from the events, click here
.
I look forward to opportunities like these to meet with Minnesotans. For
more on these events and for information on future coffee meetings,

Holding the Federal Reserve Accountable to Taxpayers
Newly appointment Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen made her debut
before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this month.
Prior to the hearing, I posed a question on social media inquiring what
my constituents would ask Chair Yellen if given the opportunity. The
response overwhelmingly called for a full-scale audit of the Federal
Reserve, a push I myself have long-supported
.
