How Would You Fix Washington?
How would you fix
Washington? Every month I host a live telephone discussion with thousands of
Utahns to answer their questions, open a dialogue on important issues,
and build awareness for policies I am supporting. This month, I want
to hear how you would fix Washington. You can share your policy
proposals on
this form . I will
invite up to three policy innovators to join me during this live telephone
townhall to discuss their proposals. All serious proposals that
provide innovative ideas for addressing our national opportunity crisis or
simply fixing a broken government in Washington will be considered. I
believe Utahns have a vital role to play in determining the future
direction of the country, and this is your chance to play your
part.

Debating the National Defense Authorization
Act
The Senate is currently debating the National Defense
Authorization Act to renew our nation's most important defense
related programs.
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
I fought to ensure that language was included that would
preserve Utah's National Guard Fleet . The bill is currently
being debated in an open process on the Senate Floor, and I recently
introduced an amendment with several other colleagues
that would delay listing the Greater Sage Grouse
under the
Endangered Species Act. This delay would give states the ability to
implement conservation plans to ensure our military readiness and the
survival of the bird. In addition to these two provisions, I am also
committed to making sure the NDAA doesn't contain language that would deny
due process rights to Americans.
I will keep you updated on the
progress of my efforts on this bill to make sure it meets the needs of
Utah's defense community and the defense needs of the
nation.
