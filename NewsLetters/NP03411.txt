A new year, a new Congress
Dear David,
2015 is here and Congress is back in session.
There were some big Montana successes at the end of the year with the passage of a major public lands package and preservation of some of our state's most treasured places.
In 2015, we need to build off of that success and continue to move our state and our nation forward.
Like many of you, I have a pretty long list of resolutions that I'd like to get done this year, and they all center around strengthening the middle class.
At the top of my list is improving our nation's infrastructure.
Congress must pass a long-term Highway Bill to ensure safe and reliable roads and bridges so businesses can get their goods to market and Montana families can stay connected.
Congress also needs to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration to repair runways and implement safety upgrades so Montana can attract more flights and generate more business.
And we need to expand broadband access to rural customers and businesses.
Aside from infrastructure improvements, Congress needs to make investments in public education.
A quality education is key to opening up economic opportunities for middle class families.
We must also reform the U.S. Postal Service by putting the agency on sound financial footing without threatening delivery standards in rural America or stripping benefits for postal workers.
And we need to reform our housing finance system to support affordable, responsible home ownership.
All of these proposals are bipartisan and will create more economic certainty for small businesses and working families.
If we're going to continue moving Montana forward and strengthening our economy, we have to roll up our sleeves and work together.
I look forward to serving you in 2015.
Take care,
