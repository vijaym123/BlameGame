Hello
Friends!
I hope you have enjoyed these past few weeks! I've definitely been
busy fighting for you and carrying your voice in Wisconsin and
Congress. Please see below for my latest
news!
I was
excited to learn that Wisconsin's same-sex marriage ban
was ruled unconstitutional . Over 500 couples
applied for or obtained marriage licenses before the judge temporarily
halted the marriages. I was
proud
to stand
with Senator Baldwin and Representatives Kind and Pocan to
ask U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to
federally recognize same-sex married couples
in Wisconsin. I
eagerly await his response.
As
always, it so great to attend Milwaukee's annual Pride
Parade!
This month,
I was so proud to
honor
90 year old veteran Anna Mae Wilson Robertson
one of our unsung
heroes
with military service medals. Mrs. Robertson received the Womens
Army Corps Service Medal, American Campaign Medal,
European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal and the
Honorable Service Lapel Button WWII. I thank her for her service and her
dedication to our country.
I also joined a new
effort
called "Witness Wednesdays" to support the more than 3 million
Americans, including over 59,000 in Wisconsin, who have been thrown
off of the unemployment insurance lifeline. I will continue to share
their stories and fight for these vital
benefits.
In Other
News:
I created an
agenda for fighting hunger
in our communities year-round, because we
cannot consign children to a summer of hunger and expect them to come
back to school in the fall ready to
learn.
On
June 19, 149 years ago, enslaved individuals in Galveston, Texas
learned that, by law, they could no longer be sold or forced to work, as
the property of slave owners. This day was a profound moment in American
history and is
known as
Juneteenth .
I was so proud to
announce the appointment of Ms. Hannah Rosenthal
to
the Commission on International Religious Freedom. I look forward to
her continued service and emboldening our fight against hatred,
injustice and intolerance.
I am pleased to announce
that the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General has
released their report entitled,
New
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Firms Face Barriers to Obtaining
Work at the Nations Largest Airports ," which I requested as part of
the 2012 Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill. I will
continue to help qualified firms better compete for and win work
on federally funded
projects.
It was wonderful meeting with the Navajo Housing
Authority!
I spoke on the House floor to explain the dire housing
need in the Native American
community.
I enjoyed speaking with the Gamaliel Foundation and Milwaukee
Inner-city Congregations Allied for Hope representatives on the importance of
mentoring!
I spoke during a Budget Committee hearing
about why we can't promote policies that might make women a permanent
underclass.
It was
important to join Leader Pelosi and my YWCA friends to speak on keeping
women safe from gun related domestic
violence.
