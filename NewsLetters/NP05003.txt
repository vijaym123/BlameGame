I&rsquo;ll be very direct: What you do before the final end-of-month deadline in 15 hours will determine whether Democrats win the Senate.

I was raised to believe I couldn&rsquo;t be right all the time. And so I never said to anybody: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my way or the highway.&rdquo;
But that&rsquo;s the way these Republicans have been operating. And if they take over the Senate, you&rsquo;ll see endless gridlock and obstruction, except when it comes to tax cuts and other favors for their special interest friends. You deserve better.
That&rsquo;s why you have to help stop them from hijacking our country.
That&rsquo;s bad for our working families, our efforts to grow the middle class, and our plans to provide affordable college education and job training. It&rsquo;s bad for our children&rsquo;s futures.
Will you pitch in to keep the Senate blue before the end-of-month deadline in 14 hours?
Thank you,
Bill Clinton
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
