Dear Friend, On the morning of November 5, 2014, when all the votes have been cast, what sort of headlines are we going to see?
Here in Massachusetts, we&rsquo;ve seen some shocking day-after headlines. Four years ago, we watched as the Tea Party took over the U.S. House of Representatives. A few months before that, a Republican ascended to the Senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy.
The only thing keeping us from those ugly headlines this November is you.
Our $36,000 FEC deadline is approaching fast, and we need your help to keep the Senate blue. Please give $5, or whatever makes sense to you -- every dollar helps.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Friend, the most popular political designation in Massachusetts isn&rsquo;t Republican or Democrat. It&rsquo;s independent, because Bay Staters don&rsquo;t care so much about party affiliation as they do about
getting the job done.
But making government work for people is not the priority for the Tea Party. And this election will determine whether we can make progress over the next two years, or whether a radical Tea Party agenda will continue to dominate Washington. With 3 days until our FEC filing deadline, I need your help to get us to $36,000. Can you pitch in $5, $10, or more?
Thank you for your help -- it will mean the difference in the headlines this November.
