Wicker: Another Day in Court for
Fundamentally Flawed Obamacare
Justices Review Administration's Unilateral Decision to Expand
Law's Reach
As its fifth anniversary
approaches, the Presidents health-care law is again being scrutinized by the
Supreme Court.
On March 4, the justices heard oral arguments in
the case of
King v. Burwell .
The lawsuit alleges that
the Administration went beyond the law in implementing Obamacares
subsidies and mandates.
At the heart of the matter is whether
the executive branch can ignore a statute passed by Congress and
instead enact policies that serve the Administrations political
interests.
In applying subsidies to both state and federal insurance
marketplaces, or exchanges, the Internal Revenue Service has unilaterally
broadened the scope of the health-care law and federal spending,
adding billions of dollars to the national debt.
The law as written
allows subsidies only for insurance plans through exchanges
established by the State, not the federal
government.
An Unworkable
Law
The legal battle is yet another glaring example of the health-care
laws flawed framework and dysfunctional implementation. Millions of
Americans have lost the plans and doctors they liked.
Many now
have coverage that does not meet their needs or their budgets.
Some still do not have coverage at all.
According to the
independent Congressional Budget Office, 31 million Americans will lack health
insurance by 2024 despite the Presidents health-care
overhaul.
I am optimistic that the Supreme Court will recognize the Obama
Administrations attempt to rewrite an unworkable law and rule against
its unconstitutional overreach.
The
King v. Burwell
decision could present a prime opportunity to create a better way
forward. At the same time, Americans currently receiving subsidies should
not abruptly lose their coverage. A transition plan would need to be
enacted to prevent innocent people from being harmed simply because they
relied on the Administrations unlawful actions. The American people
have already suffered enough from the laws skyrocketing premiums,
canceled plans, and website glitches.
A Patient-Centered Alternative
The
federal government should be prepared for immediate action if the Court
rules against the Administration. The White House has said it does not
have a backup plan, putting the health care of millions of Americans at
risk.
If the Supreme Court finds that the Administration has
acted illegally, there are several alternative plans that Republicans in
the Senate have put forward.
I support a solution
proposed by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), and John
Barrasso (R-Wyo.) that would offer a transitional period for Americans
who may lose their subsidies because of the court decision.
The
plan would also give states the flexibility to create insurance
markets that suit the needs of their residents, rather than exchanges
hampered by federal mandates and regulations.
Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.)
has a similar proposal that would also protect Americans from lost
coverage.
The goal of health-care reform should be
broadening access, increasing choice, and lowering costs
ambitions that the
Presidents law has failed to achieve.
We have seen enough
damage from this fundamentally flawed legislation.
It is past time
for patient-centered, market-driven policies to put health-care
decisions back into the hands of Americans
where they
belong.
