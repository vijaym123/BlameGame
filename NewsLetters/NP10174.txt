Dear Neighbors,
Last spring, communities throughout our district suffered devastating
flooding. The physical damage reached into the millions of dollars and
the ongoing emotional toll cannot be quantified. This year, as the
spring rains return, many of our homes still remain in some of the
highest-risk areas for flooding. We must continue to work to mitigate
flood risk and be ready to respond rapidly if and when high waters come.
Toward that end, I want to share a couple resources that can help you
protect your family and your home this flood season.
For tips on how to plan for an emergency and prepare for the worst,
visit Ready.gov
. This website features information for individuals and businesses
and can help you with everything from planning an evacuation to
building a disaster kit.
For all of the information you may need on flooding, visit the National
Flood Insurance Program's official site, FloodSmart.gov
. This site can help you learn more about flood
maps, flood insurance, recent legislative activity and the risks of
flooding.
In Congress, I'm fighting to enhance our ability to prepare for,
mitigate and recover from future flooding. I supported and helped pass
the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act to help keep flood
insurance affordable while also strengthening the program's long-term
financial stability. I also organized some of my colleagues in strong
support of the Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning program
to give communities the information and
resources they need to mitigate risk.
As always, my office is here to help you prepare any way we can.
Contact my District Office at (847) 793-0625 or send me an email
anytime with your questions or concerns
about flooding.
This year, let's work together to keep our families, our homes and our
businesses as safe as we can from rising floods.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Neighbors,
Last
spring,
communities
throughout
our
district
suffered
devastating
flooding.
The
physical
damage
reached
into
the
millions
of
dollars
and
the
ongoing
emotional
toll
cannot

year,
as
the

many

still
remain

We
must

to
respond
rapidly
if
and

high
waters
come.

that
end,
