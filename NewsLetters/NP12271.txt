How can we stay in
touch?
Dear Friend,
I hope this isn't the last time
you hear from me in a while, but it might be.
I'm
reaching out to make sure you know everything my office and I can do to
assist you and your family for two reasons.
First, serving you
is my job.
Second, this e-mail is time sensitive.
Because Georgia elections will come early this year, I'm prohibited
from sending mass communications starting this month.
That
means I'll be able to reply to e-mails or letters you send me as always,
but I can't reach out to you proactively.
If you subscribe to my e-mail list, we can stay in touch
any day, any time.
It's my pleasure to represent
you in Congress, to draft legislation that makes our country better,
and to vote as I feel you'd want me to vote on the House floor.
Below you'll find information about the additional ways I serve
Northeast Georgians every day, and I want you to know you have a standing
invitation to call my office any time.
In addition to
these services, I provide a weekly update of what's happening in
Northeast Georgia and in Washington.
Feel free to sign up
here.
Let's keep in touch,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
P.S. I'm having a telephone town hall on Wednesday night.
Feel
free to join us.
You may call in on
Wednesday night at
6:30
using this number
(877) 229-8493
and
