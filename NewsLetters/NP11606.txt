David --
Paul Ryan has it out for the middle class.
Last year, he proposed a budget that would raise taxes on the middle class while giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. He even tried to get rid of early education programs and destroy Medicare as we know it.
I voted against Paul Ryan&rsquo;s out-of-touch budget last year because it was so wrong for Illinois families -- but there&rsquo;s anticipation Ryan&rsquo;s new budget could be his worst yet. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m joining other folks across the country in taking an early stand against Paul Ryan&rsquo;s extreme agenda.
Will you join us in reaching
ONE MILLION STRONG
to fight for America&rsquo;s middle class against the Ryan budget? David, please click here to automatically sign your name to help us reach one million strong standing against Paul Ryan&rsquo;s irresponsible budget plans &gt;&gt;
We&rsquo;ve seen Ryan&rsquo;s vision of the future before. It includes less access to education, hungrier families, and veterans struggling to make ends meet. But believe it or not, my opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling voted for this budget multiple times!
Look, Paul Ryan simply doesn&rsquo;t understand the struggles of everyday Americans. Please, help us reach one million strong to stand up to his reckless agenda: http://action.cheribustos.com/One-Million-Strong
