Dear
Friend,
For the past several months, we have seen the troubling
spread of the Ebola virus in several countries in West Africa. With the
recent news of three confirmed cases here in the United States, it is
clear that the treatment and prevention of Ebola is now a pressing
priority.
As your Representative, I want to provide you with
information about Ebola, including how it spreads, what you can do to
protect yourself, and what the Administration is doing to fight the
outbreak.
What is Ebola?
Ebola,
previously known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease
caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus
strains.
Symptoms of Ebola include:
Fever (greater than
38.6C or 101.5F)
Severe headache
Muscle pain
Weakness
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Abdominal (stomach)
pain
Unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or
bruising)
Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after
exposure to Ebola, but the average is 8 to 10 days.
How
is it transmitted?
When an infection does occur, the virus
can be spread in several ways to others. Ebola is spread through
direct contact with:
Blood or
body fluids (including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces,
vomit, breast milk, and semen) of a person who is infected with
Ebola.
Objects (like needles and
syringes) that have been contaminated with the virus.
A few species of mammals (for example, bats,
monkeys, and apes).
Ebola is
not
spread through the air or by water, or in
general, by food. There is no evidence that mosquitos or other insects can
transmit the Ebola virus. A person must have symptoms to spread Ebola
to others.
How can I protect myself against
it?
There is not yet a FDA-approved vaccine available
for Ebola.
Practice careful
hygiene. For example, wash your hands with soap and water or an
alcohol-based hand sanitizer and avoid contact with blood and body
fluids.
Do not handle items that may
have come in contact with an infected persons blood or body fluids
(such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical
equipment).
What is being done to stop the spread of
Ebola?
President Obama Appoints Ebola Czar
The
President has appointed Ron Klain to oversee the governments Ebola
response .
He will be tasked with coordinating the efforts to protect
the American people by detecting, isolating and treating Ebola
patients in this country.
Support for Hospitals and
Healthcare Workers
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) will now send a rapid response team to the hospital where a
patient is housed within 24 hours of an Ebola diagnosis. This measure
will allow the CDC to walk local hospitals through the proper protocols
step-by-step to ensure the safety of patients and healthcare
workers.
The CDC is providing guidance
and tools for hospitals and healthcare providers to prepare for and
manage potential patients, protect healthcare workers, and respond in a
coordinated fashion.
Vaccine Development
The Department of Health and Human
Services is advancing the development and clinical trials of Ebola
vaccines and antivirals to determine their safety and effectiveness in
humans.
Passenger Screening
U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) and the CDC have closely coordinated to
develop policies, procedures, and protocols to identify travelers who may
have Ebola, responding in a manner that minimizes risk to the
public.
Among these measures:
CBP personnel review all travelers entering the United States for
general overt signs of illness (visual observation, questioning, and
notification of CDC as appropriate) at all U.S. ports of entry, including
all federal inspection services areas at U.S. airports that service
international flights.
When a
traveler is identified with a possible communicable disease or identified
from information that is received from the CDC, CBP personnel will
take the appropriate safety measures by referring the traveler to a
secondary screening, isolating the traveler from other travelers, and
referring to CDC or public health officials for a medical
assessment.
CBP personnel receive
training in illness recognition, but if they identify an individual
believed to be infected with Ebola, CBP will contact CDC along with local
public health authorities to help with further medical
evaluation.
I know that many of
you are concerned about the spread of Ebola and our efforts to combat
it, and I appreciate all of you who have contacted me. I want you to
know that I share your concern and am dedicated to keeping our
communities safe. I encourage you to continue to share your questions and
concerns with my office. Also, refer to the CDC website at
www.cdc.gov
for any additional information about Ebola and the
steps we are taking to combat it. As we move forward, I pledge to
keep you informed on this matter.
Sincerely,
