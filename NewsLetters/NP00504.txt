Dear Friend,
Today we remember the loss of the heroic men and women who sacrificed their lives in defense of freedom and liberty.
We owe our way of life to their courage.
Their willingness to fight is the reason why we live in a country free from tyranny and oppression.
In honor of Memorial Day, Im happy to announce that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee this week passed my bill to
rename
the United States Post Office building located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, NJ the Staff Sergeant Joseph DAugustine Post Office Building.
This action clears the way for this important legislation to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to President Obama for his signature.
As you may know, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine, a 2001 Waldwick High School graduate, was killed in action in the Helmand province of Afghanistan on March 27, 2012.
He gave his life while protecting his fellow men and women in uniform.
Renaming the Waldwick Post Office after a hometown hero would be a fitting tribute to this brave young man.
As we remember and honor our fallen heroes like Staff Sergeant D'Augustinewe also remember their families.
We offer prayers for the comfort of those living with the pain of loss. Nothing will ever replace our loved ones who gave their lives to protect the United States, but we can live our lives in a way that honors their memory.
On this Memorial Day, may God bless the families who grieve for their loved ones, and may God bless all those who have laid down their lives in defense of the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
