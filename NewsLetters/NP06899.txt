interview.
Appearing on MSNBCs The Daily Rundown yesterday
to discuss reports that the U.S. is laying the groundwork for
airstrikes in Syria following actions by militants from the Islamic State of
Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), who have taken control of major cities
in the region, Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he hopes the White House will come to Congress
and ask for a new authorization to address this threat that has
evolved over time.
For the American people's sake, Congress
should weigh in. Congress should be a part of this, said Corker. I've
been talking to colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think
there's a general agreement that a new authorization needs to take
place.
I would hope the American people would demand that the
people they're voting for state their position on an issue that's
such a threat to us both now and over the longer term, added Corker. I
think it's our responsibility as elected officials to let the American
people know where we stand with respect to national security
matters.
Russian Convoy
Entering Ukraine Must be Met with
Strength
Senator Corker issued the following statement last week regarding
reports of a Russian convoy entering Ukraine with military artillery and
personnel:
Reports of further Russian movement into Ukraine
bear all the hallmarks of Crimea and must be met with strength,
including broader, more crippling sanctions, appropriate lethal assistance
and long-requested intelligence support for Ukraine. Our constant
dithering on a response to Russian aggression over the last several months
has empowered Putin to press forward instead of demonstrating that we
are strongly committed to Ukrainian independence. Permitting Putin to
continue these provocative acts could result in devastating and
perhaps irreversible consequences.
In April, Senator Corker
introduced
legislation
as a strategic response to
Russian aggression in Europe. The bill would strengthen the NATO
alliance, impose a series of tough sanctions for specific Russian actions,
including against Rosneft, Novatek, Gazprombank and VEB, and
authorize defensive military assistance and support for non-NATO allies of
Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.
