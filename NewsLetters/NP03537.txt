President Obama
Should Visit Phoenix VA Hospital
1/7/15
Congressman
Doug Lamborn, the second ranking Republican on the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, is calling on President Obama to visit the
scandal-plagued VA Hospital during his trip to
Phoenix.
"The Phoenix VA Hospital was the epicenter of the
waitlist scandals that have rocked the VA over the last year, causing an
evaporation of trust between many veterans and the VA. Unfortunately,
President Obama has not visited a VA hospital since last April
and is choosing not to drive down the block
to visit the Phoenix VA Hospital. This is a missed opportunity for
the President to show veterans that he is paying attention to the
challenges they face at the VA. Veterans concerned about a lack of
presidential leadership should know that the House Veterans Affairs
Committee will continue to provide oversight and legislation designed to
improve the healthcare our wounded warriors have
earned."
