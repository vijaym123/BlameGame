Chabot Chosen to Lead Small Business Committee
Pledges to focus on enabling entrepreneurship and expanding free enterprise
On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives Republican Steering Committee unanimously selected Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) to lead the House Small Business Committee as Chairman in the 114th Congress.
Following his selection, Chabot released the following statement:
I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to lead a Committee with such a worthy goal as helping Americas small businesses.
Small businesses and entrepreneurs embody the essence of the American dream, offering anyone with a vision and willingness to work hard the opportunity to lead a successful life. Like many other Americans, working for a small business helped pay my way through high school and reinforced the time-tested values my parents taught me as child, such as hard work, accountability, and the value of a dollar.
Unfortunately, in the last six years, small businesses have shouldered the disproportionate burden of new regulations, higher taxes, and more difficult barriers to the capital needed to grow. The Obama Administrations policiesfrom Dodd-Frank, to Obamacare, to an emboldened EPAhave made operating a business or starting a new business more challenging than ever before.
As Chairman, I will work each day to make life better for small businesses and working families by leading a Committee that is intensely focused on enabling entrepreneurship and expanding free enterprise, so that together, we can create vibrant communities with more opportunity, more innovation, and greater prosperity.
U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot has proudly served Ohio's First Congressional District for 18 years after being first elected in 1994. In addition to the Small Business Committee, he is also a Member of the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee.
