In June, I joined my colleagues in the House to support a 1.8% raise for our servicemembers; however, in August, the President
announced
that he believed their pay should be reduced.
This cut comes at a time when we have troops deployed around the world, and the Administration has cut billions of dollars from our national defense and subjected our military to sequestration.
I oppose the Presidents decision to reduce the pay of our servicemembers
they are not the cause of our nations fiscal problems and should not be forced to carry the weight of solving it.
I will continue my steadfast support for our nations heroes, ensuring they receive the benefits and compensation they have earned and deserve.
Yours in service,
Randy
