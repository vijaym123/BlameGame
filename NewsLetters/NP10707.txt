Study after study has shown that women are paid 23 cents less on the dollar than men for the same work. And in our region of Illinois? A disappointing 30 cents less!
That means that women have fewer dollars to spend on family needs like healthcare, childcare, education, or even just the utility bills.
This is just plain wrong. And it&rsquo;s hurting our economy. That&rsquo;s why Cheri is joining with folks all across the country to reach 100,000 strong for equal pay.
