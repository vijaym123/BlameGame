Government regulations have been trending upwards at an alarming rate over
the past few decades.
These new regulations flowing from
unelected bureaucrats hinder job growth and are hitting hard working
taxpayers with increased costs.
In September, the House passed
bipartisan legislation to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) as the agency seeks to redefine "waters of the United States" under
the Clean Water Act (CWA).
I voted to ditch this
rule.
The EPA is leading the way when it comes to threatening our freedom
and job creation with the department's regulations.
The EPA and
the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) have been attempting to expand
the federal government's regulatory powers under the CWA by redefining
"waters of the United States."
Under this proposed rule, almost
any low spot where rainwater collects could be regulated by the federal
government.
The protection of our natural environment,
including air and water sources, is very important for all Americans.
America has one of the very best environmental records in the world and
enjoys an immense bounty of naturally beautiful ecosystems.
However, the EPA has increasingly attempted to impose harsh rules with
dubious or non-existent environmental benefits.
Instead of allowing
this to continue, I suggest we focus on passing legislation that will
protect landowners from burdensome regulatory overreach and
irrational rules.
Recently I voted alongside a number of my
colleagues to pass the
Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach
Protection Act
(H.R. 5078).
This legislation specifically
exempts from federal jurisdiction streams which may only form when rain
falls, prohibits the EPA and Corps from regulating or reinterpreting
the definition of navigable waters without Congressional authorization,
and returns the authority of waterways not under the jurisdiction of
the CWA to states and local authorities.
We need to ditch
this EPA proposed rule, and it is my hope that passing this bipartisan
legislation will serve as an attempt to begin the very necessary
rollback of federal regulations.
I will continue to work to reduce
regulatory burdens and protect the freedom of all
Americans.
