Hello,
We had a busy week in DC so I'll get right to
it.
Elected Officials
Conference
We had over 200 local elected
officials head out to DC this week to meet with me, my colleagues, federal
agencies and other groups to solve the problems facing their communities.
I represent 7 different
counties and I'm proud that we had City Council members, Township Trustees,
City Managers, Mayors, or County Commissioners from all 7 counties come
to DC.
Here's a picture of me
meeting with
Mayor Joe Cicero and leaders from Lyndhurst in our DC
office this week to discuss how we can work
together.
Passing
Bills
Last week I told you that we had two
major accomplishments by passing two of our Appropriations Committee
funding bills out of the committee, and that they were headed for the
House floor.
Well, this week, not
only did they hit the floor - we passed these bipartisan bills.
This is a major accomplishment
because this is the earliest the Appropriations process has started since
1974!
The House passed the FY16 Military
Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill, which will fund
programs for our troops, military families, defense infrastructure and
our veterans.
I serve on this
subcommittee, so I was proud to see this bill passed out of the House after a
lot hard work on it.
The House also passed the
FY16 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which funds national
security efforts, energy security investments and critical water
infrastructure projects.
I fought tooth and
nail to get language inserted into this bill that would make sure the
Army Corps of Engineers does not dump toxic dredge materials in our Great
Lakes. This is a huge win for the Great
Lakes.
Passing a
Budget
Besides passing those Appropriations bills, the House also made took an
important step by passing a Budget.
Earlier this year,
both the House and the Senate passed a Budget of their own. After each
chamber passes a budget, it goes to "conference" where they resolve
the differences and come together to produce one budget.
So, this week, the House got the budget back from conference and we
proudly passed a budget that:
Balances
within 10 years
Does not raise
taxes
Strengthens our nations
defense
Protects our most vulnerable
citizens
Improves economic growth and opportunity for
hardworking families
Stops the federal
governments out of control spending
Visiting Constituents
If you are ever in DC, please give us a call and we will be happy
to set you and your group up with a tour of the U.S. Capitol.
On my way back from a meeting, I ran
into our intern Lauren who was giving a tour to a group of my
constituents.
I stopped and chatted with
them for a moment but one
my young constituents was a bit shy, so
I showed her the background on my phone - a picture of my two
beautiful daughters who used to be little girls just like
her.
I wanted to share that story because it's
those interactions with the people I represent that matter the most -
because it always reminds me how much of an honor it is to be your voice
in Congress.
I work hard
every day to serve and represent you to the best of my
ability.
