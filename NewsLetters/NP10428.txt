Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
There is nothing more gratifying than being home in the 2nd District.
It seems like every time I step off that plane from Washington, DC, I
can finally exhale.
Serving as your Representative is one of the
greatest honors of my life.
It's so personal for me because the 2nd
District is my home.
It's where I was raised, worked, volunteered, go
to church, raised my children, and where I met my husband Ray of
twenty-seven years.
My life is woven into the fabric of this
community.
St. Louisans all share this common bond of love for the neighborhoods
we grew up in, the high schools we attended and the values we learned
growing up.
For all of us, the St. Louis region gives us a great deal
of strength and pride that folks from other cities can't quite figure
out.
So when I say serving the people of Missouri's 2nd District is
one of the greatest honors of my life, I mean it.
My grandmother always told me we have two ears and one mouth for a
reason.
That's why when I'm back in the 2nd District, I spend a lot of
time listening to the thoughts and concerns of the people I represent.
This past week I had numerous meetings with constituents, businesses
and groups from all over the 2nd District.
One of the meetings I wanted to highlight dealt with various levels of
law enforcement officials on how we, as a community, can continue to
combat sex trafficking.
Representatives from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Secret Service, Homeland Security, St. Charles and St.
Louis police and local and state prosecutors all joined me in an open
and honest discussion on the challenges of fighting sex trafficking in
our communities.
We talked at length about the legislative package I fought to champion
along with other members of Congress to battle sex trafficking.
They
all agreed that our current laws must be updated to give prosecutors
and law enforcement officials the tools they need to protect the most
vulnerable members of our society.
To find out more information about
my bill, the SAVE Act, please visit http://wagner.house.gov/notforsale
I also questioned the group about what else we could do to combat sex
trafficking.
They gave me a one word answer:
Awareness.
So I wanted
to share some key websites and phone numbers with you to call if you
see something that doesn't look quite right.
Because if we can just
save one more girl or put one more criminal behind bars, it will get us
one step closer to getting rid of this heinous criminal enterprise
infecting our neighborhoods.
Here are some helpful websites and phone numbers to alert officials
about sex trafficking in Eastern Missouri.

Highlights from the Week:
Fighting for Jobs
Last week, I wrote an op-ed in the St. Louis Business Journal about how
important the E/A-18G Growler is to not only our national security, but
our local economic security as well.

Visiting Canterbury Enterprises:
It was truly inspiring to work with and talk to the good people at
Canterbury Enterprises. Their goal is to produce the highest quality of
work through a dedicated workforce primarily comprised of people with
disabilities.
Bethesda Health Group:
I also had a great meeting with the leadership team at Bethesda Health
Group.
Holy Season:
This past weekend served as a reminder of the many blessings we have.
For families all over the 2nd District and across the nation, this is a
special and sacred time of year.
It's a time of year where both the
Christian and Jewish communities can spend time in prayer and
reflection.
The holy season is a time of forgiveness and resurrection,
a time of hope and triumph.
From my family to yours, I hope everyone
had a blessed weekend.
As always, it is truly an honor to serve you and I look forward to
speaking with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Ann's
Weekly
Roundup
Dear
Friend,
There
is
nothing
more
gratifying
than
being
home
in
the
2nd
District.
It
seems
like
every
time
I
step
off
that
plane
from
Washington,
DC,
I
can
finally
exhale.
Serving
as
your
Representative
is
one
of
the
greatest
honors
of
my
life.
It's
so
personal
for
me
because
the
2nd
District
is
my
home.
It&#8217;s
where
I
was
raised,
worked,
volunteered,
go
to
church,
raised
my
children,
and
where
I
met
my
husband
Ray
of
twenty-seven
years.
My
life
is
woven
into
the
fabric
of
this
community.
St.
Louisans
all
share
this
common
bond
of
love
for
the
neighborhoods
we
grew
up
in,
the
high
schools
we
attended
and
the
values
we
learned
growing
up.
For
all
of
us,
the
St.
Louis
region
gives
us
a
great
deal
of
strength
and
pride
that
folks
from
other
cities
can&#8217;t
quite
figure
out.
So
when
I
say
serving
the
people
of
Missouri&#8217;s
2nd
District
is
one
of
the
greatest
honors
of
my
life,
I
mean
it.
My
grandmother
always
told
me
we
have
two
ears
and
one
mouth
for
a
reason.
That&#8217;s
why
when
I&#8217;m
back
in
the
2nd
District,
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
listening
to
the
thoughts
and
concerns
of
the
people
I
represent.
This
past week
I had
numerous
meetings
with
constituents,
businesses
and
groups
from
all
over
the
2nd
District.
One
of
the
meetings
I
wanted
to
highlight
dealt
with
various
levels
of
law
enforcement
officials
on
how
we,
as
a
community,
can
continue
to
combat
sex
trafficking.
Representatives
from
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation,
Secret
Service,
Homeland
Security,
St.
Charles
and
St.
Louis
police
and
local
and
state
prosecutors
all
joined
me
in
an
open
and
honest
discussion
on
the
challenges
of
fighting
sex
trafficking
in
our
communities.
We
talked
at
length
about
the
legislative
package
I
fought
to
champion
along
with
other
members
of
Congress
to
battle
sex
trafficking.
They
all
agreed
that
our
current
laws must
be
updated
to
give
prosecutors
and
law
enforcement
officials
the
tools
they
need
to
protect
the
most
vulnerable
members
of
our
society.
To
find
out
more
information
about
my
bill,
the
SAVE
Act,
please
visit
http://wagner.house.gov/notforsale
I
also questioned
the group
about
what
else
we
could
do
to
combat
sex
trafficking.
They
gave
me
a
one
word
answer:
Awareness.
So
I
wanted
to
share
some
key
websites
and
phone
numbers with
you
to
call
if
you
see
something
that
doesn&#8217;t
look
quite
right.
Because
if
we
can
just
save
one
more girl
or
put
one
more
criminal
behind
bars,
it
will
get
us
one
step
closer
to
getting
rid
of
this
heinous
criminal
enterprise
infecting
our
neighborhoods.
Here
are
some
helpful
websites
and
phone
numbers
to
alert
officials
about
sex
trafficking
in

It
was

to

Their
goal
is
to
produce
the
highest
quality
of
work
through
a
dedicated
workforce
primarily
comprised
of
people
with

Bethesda

Group:
I
also
had
a
great
meeting
with
the
leadership
team
at
Bethesda
Health
Group.
Holy
Season:
This
past
weekend
served
as
a
reminder
of
the
many
blessings
we
have.
For
families
all
over
the
2nd
District
and
across
the
nation,
this
is
a
special
and
sacred
time
of
year.
It&#8217;s
a
time
of
year
where
both
the
Christian
and
Jewish
communities
can
spend
time
in
prayer
and
reflection.
The
holy
season
is
a
time
of
forgiveness
and
resurrection,
a
time
of
hope
and
triumph.
From
my
family
to
yours,
I
hope
everyone
had
a
blessed
weekend.
As
always,
it
is
truly
an
honor
to
serve
you
and
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
again
soon.
Sincerely,
Ann
