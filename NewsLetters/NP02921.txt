Dear Friends:
As families across America tighten their
belts, balance their budgets, and live within
their own means, why shouldnt Washington
do the same?
Our governments lack of adherence to
this principle of fiscal responsibility took
center stage with the release of President
Obamas $4 trillion fiscal year 2016
Budget, which includes massive new tax hikes and
$4 trillion in reckless government
spending.
The Presidents budget is a stark
reminder of the dire need for a Balanced Budget
Amendment (BBA), which I introduced in the United
States Senate today. Every Republican
Senator is an original cosponsor of the
resolution. This is the seventh BBA I have
sponsored, and I am pleased to have been an
original co-sponsor of 20 others. Im
proud to have earned the nickname Mr.
Balanced Budget from President Ronald
Reagan.
The federal government will handle the
American peoples money responsibly only if
the Constitution requires it to do so.
Every other approach has failed to curb our
nations runaway debt, which is reaching
unprecedented levels. Consider, for a
moment, the gravity of our situation
adjusted for inflation, the national debt is
seven times larger than it was when I introduced
my first BBA in 1979.
The Constitution is the American
peoples rulebook for government, and a
Balanced Budget Amendment is the only way to
ensure that elected officials prioritize spending
and are held accountable.
Future generations should not have to foot the
bill for our governments wasteful
spending. This is a worthy fight, and
together I know we can force Washington to follow
the lead of every American family and finally
pass a Balanced Budget Amendment.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
P. S. Below is a chart I thought you might be
interested in. It shows the national debt
at the introduction of several of the Balanced
Budget Amendments I have supported. This
chart demonstrates that Washington has continued
to kick the can down the road as our national
debt grows to unprecedented levels. A
Balanced Budget Amendment would go a long way
towards helping get spending under
control.
