VISITING DC
December 05, 2014
Wednesday evening the House passed a piece of
legislation Senator Casey and I have been working on for nearly 8 years. The
Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act passed with broad
bipartisan support, 404-17.
I am incredibly pleased that the House
passed the ABLE Act this week. Families of individuals with
disabilities often face overwhelming financial burdens associated with the
expensive costs of healthcare, education, housing and transportation. The
ABLE Act will make it easier for parents of disabled individuals to
invest in their childs future, thereby opening the door to a world of
opportunities. More info about ABLE Act can be
found
here .
USA Today called the ABLE Act
the
first major piece of legislation affecting Americans with disabilities
in nearly 25 years
and Politico called it the sleeper hit of
this Congress.
With more than 380 cosponsors in the House and 78
cosponsors in the Senate, the ABLE Act is the most supported
legislation in this Congress.
The ABLE Act is also supported by the
National Down Syndrome Society, Autism Speaks, The Arc, Collaborations
to Promote Self Determination, the National Disability Institute and
the National Fragile X Foundation.
Yesterday, I held a press
call with Senator Casey and Down Syndrome advocate Sara Wolff. Sara
shared some of her story and why the ABLE Act is so important to her
future. Senator Casey and I talked a little about the ABLE Act and the
process for getting it to where it is today. You can see a picture of us
below.
This weekend, the House
champions of the ABLE Act -- Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers,
Congressman Pete Sessions, and Congressman Ander Crenshaw -- will be
delivering the Weekly Radio Address to highlight the Houses passage of the
bill. The address will be available starting tomorrow morning
here .
I am confident the Senate will swiftly
pass the ABLE Act in the coming week.
In other news, I am
also pleased to announced that yesterday afternoon the House passed H.R.
4435, a bill that includes legislation I authored known as the
Preserving Public Access to Cape Hatteras Beaches Act (S. 486).
After
significant effort earlier in the week, we ensured that my legislation
on Hatteras access would be included as part of the larger
legislation that the House of Representatives passed.
Interference from
outside interest groups and Federal restrictions on beach access have
crippled local businesses along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore
for years
it has impaired the local community and its economy. This
House vote is a win for North Carolinians and tourists from around the
country who wish to visit North Carolinas scenic treasures. This has
been a long journey that required compromise on both sides of the
aisle in order to see it through. I feel confident that my Senate
colleagues will swiftly pass this legislation and unlock the beauty of North
Carolinas shores. You can read more about the Hatteras Beach Access
legislation
here . Also, Island Free Press had a
great piece breaking down some of the inside baseball behind the
Hatteras legislation,
read here .
On Monday, I
joined Senator Casey at a Politico Pro Briefing to discuss whether the
U.S. is prepared to handle a public health emergency, highlighting
the recent Ebola response efforts in West Africa and here as a case
study.
You can watch the discussionin full

or by clicking below.
You
can read some of the highlights from our conversation on innovation,
leadership, and the importance of public-private partnerships when
confronting public health crises
here .
Finally, I introduced a resolution this week recognizing the heroic acts
of the Montagnards, an indigenous tribespeople of Vietnam. My
resolution is an historic first in the Senate, which has not previously honored
these brave individuals who fought alongside the United States
military during the Vietnam War.
It also condemns the Government of
Vietnam for its ongoing and reported violations of the Montagnards'
basic human rights, including the freedom to practice their faith without
fear of persecution.
More than 60,000 Montagnards assisted
U.S. troops as interpreters, scouts, and soldiers during the war. After
the Vietnam War, the U.S. resettled thousands of Montagnards as
refugees to escape persecution from the Vietnamese government. Currently,
the largest population of Montagnards outside of Vietnam resides in
North Carolina, but Montagnards also resettled in other states, including
in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Washington.
Its time we honored their contributions -- you can read the text
of the resolution

Sincerely,
Richard Burr
