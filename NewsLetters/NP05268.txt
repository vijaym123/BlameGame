FREE Medicare Open
Enrollment Event Tomorrow, OPEN TO ALL
Open enrollment has begun and runs
until December 7.
Attention Seniors, are you prepared to
make changes to your Medicare plan?
To
assist you in making your important healthcare coverage decisions I have
set up two scheduled
Medicare Open
Enrollment Assistance
Events here in
Kansas.
Attendees will have the opportunity for face-to-face assistance from
knowledgeable benefits counselors from the
Senior Health Insurance Counseling for Kansas
(SHICK)
program.
The first event will be
held tomorrow:
Wednesday,
October 22 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. in the Community Room at the
Wyandotte County Aging and Disability Resource Center in Kansas City,
Kansas.
Medicare
beneficiaries who wish to make changes or enroll for the first time need
to bring their Medicare card, any current prescriptions (including
dosage and frequency), and a list of preferred
pharmacies.
If you can't attend the session tomorrow, I am
hosting another
event:
Thursday, November 6 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Sylvester Powell
Community Center in Mission,
Kansas.
Each year
there are new health plan and prescription drug coverage choices to
consider and it is our goal to make this decision process as easy as we
can for you. For more information on the upcoming Medicare Open
Enrollment event, visit my
website .
For
additional information, please contact my
District Office
