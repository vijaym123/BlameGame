The 6th District
Dear Friends:
This week the U.S. Senate unanimously
passed an amendment to the anti-human trafficking bill which helps close
a frightening loophole for sex offenders in the
military.
Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier and I introduced
similar legislation in the House of Representatives in February, the
Military Track, Register, and Alert Communities Act, so I am very glad to see
this critical reform move forward towards becoming
law.
There is a current loophole that has allowed sex offenders in
the military to transition to civilian life without registering on sex
offender lists. The bill from Congresswoman Speier and me would
require the Department of Defense to maintain a database of all military
personnel who have been convicted of a sexual crime, and ensure
communities are informed when those offenders move into their
neighborhoods.
You can read the op-ed that Congresswoman Speier and
I wrote about our reform
here .
It is common sense, bipartisan legislation and I am happy
to see it moving swiftly through the legislative
process.
The anti-human trafficking legislation, with the sexual
predator reform included, will now come back to the House and I will fight
hard to ensure it makes it into
law.
Sincerely,
Mike
Coffman
U.S. Representative

Senetors in Colorado to
Scrutinize Over-Budget VA Hospital
By: Staff
The Denver
Post
Published April
24, 2015
Leaders of the U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee are
traveling to Colorado to ask why the VA hospital under construction in
suburban Denver is more than $1 billion over
budget.
The committee's
Republican chairman and its top-ranking Democrat will tour the
half-finished complex in Aurora Friday and then hold a
hearing.
Also
attending will be Colorado Sens. Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner and
Rep.
Mike
Coffman .
VA Deputy
Secretary Sloan Gibson is scheduled to
testify.
The hospital is
expected to cost $1.73 billion, up from $630 million estimated last
year.
The VA has asked Congress for another $830 million to finish the
complex. It wants to take the money from a $5 billion fund Congress
approved to improve veterans' access to
care.
Some lawmakers are
promising to fight that plan.

ISIS

The Denver Post
Published April 23,
2015
Metro Denver's African immigrant community will hold a
candlelight vigil Saturday and events Sunday and Monday to memorialize the 30
or more Ethiopian Christians shown killed by Islamic State militants
in a video released Sunday.
Metro Denver is
home to about 30,000 Ethiopians and
Eritreans.
A candlelight vigil will start at 6 p.m. Saturday at St. Mary
Ethiopian Orthodox Churchat 16250 E. Colfax Ave. in
Aurora.
A Sunday morning service at the church will be a memorial
from 10:30 a.m. to noon. Organizers are planning a spiritual service
and rally at the state Capitol from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday to raise
awareness of the "prosecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East,"
said church spokesman Nebiyu Asfaw.
U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman
of Aurora is expected to address the
issue with the congregation and any others who wish to come May
17.
"Our community is mourning the slaughtering of the
30 Ethiopian Christian brothers in Libya by the barbaric extremists,"
Asfaw said. "People have taken this very hard. It is heartbreaking to
see such cruelty. It is incomprehensible for our minds to understand
how any human being could do such a thing to another. We stand
together to mourn our brethren and pray for
peace."
