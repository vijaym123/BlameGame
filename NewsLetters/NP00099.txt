We want to be as direct as possible.
We need you to chip in $5 dollars right now. Here&rsquo;s all you need to know:
Cheri is the MOST vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois. Period.
End-of-quarter is approaching FAST -- it&rsquo;s only SIX days away
And right now, we&rsquo;re seriously behind our fundraising goal
We need to make sure Cheri has the resources to stay competitive. But that starts with hitting every deadline between now and Election Day -- especially the ones that will be made PUBLIC (and this is one of them)
So please David, can you chip in $5 to help us close the gap?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

We know you won&rsquo;t let us down!
