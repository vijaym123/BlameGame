"I'm proud that the abort launch motor and
other integral components involved in this launch
were built in Utah and I hope Utahns will
continue to play a key role as Americans journey
to the stars and beyond"
Hatch
Welcomes Title Transfer of the Strawberry
Valley Project Electric Distribution System
I am pleased we have reached the final
step in transferring this important piece of land
from the federal government to the SESD. . . This
title transfer will grant authority to local
leaders that are already managing these assets,
rather than federal bureaucrats. Those on the
ground will be able to run the system in a way
thats best for local power users. This is
an important victory for South Utah County and
for the State of Utah."
Bennet,
Hatch Introduce Bill to Cut Red Tape, Boost
Innovation in Health IT
Advances in technology have allowed us
to continuously improve the efficiency and
quality of healthcare. This bill will give
innovators the certainty they need about health
IT regulation to continue pioneering medical
software for consumers and health care
professionals.

Announces Co-Sponsorship of the Regulatory
Accountability Act, Highlights Commonsense
Regulatory Reform As Priority for Next
Congress
Regulatory reform has been a priority
since my early days in the Senate, and Im
pleased to add my support to the Regulatory
Accountability Act. This legislation provides
much-needed relief to individuals and businesses
by restoring regulatory transparency, requiring
evidence-based rulemaking, and ensuring that
agencies conduct cost-benefit analysis for the
new burdens they seek to impose. This bill
represents exactly the sort of commonsense,
bipartisan legislation that we should pursue in
the next Congress. . . For too long we have
simply talked about regulatory reform
the
time for action is now.
Hatch
Lauds Senate Passage of Bill to End Social
Security Benefits for Nazis
I am proud the Senate spoke in unison
and passed this bill in a bipartisan fashion.
Its outrageous that Nazi war criminals and
anyone who participated in Nazi persecution
atrocities continue to collect Social Security
benefits while living abroad. With the
Presidents signature, this will stop once
and for all.
