Let's recap
Dear Friend,
This past week I was honored to bring my partner in the 21 st
Century Cures initiative, Congresswoman Diana DeGette (D-Colorado), to Southwest Michigan so that we could hear directly from patient groups, innovators, medical students, and community leaders about the 21 st
Century Cures initiative and how we can keep Southwest Michigan on the cutting edge of medical innovations.
We both learned a great deal and had fun getting the word out. 21 st
Century Cures is a truly nonpartisan, inclusive initiative that aims to bring hope to patients and families by delivering faster and better cures. It will positively affect families here in Southwest Michigan and across the country. To be able to share our message and get meaningful feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders was incredibly valuable.
We have made incredible strides on the 21 st
Century Cures initiative over the last year. Doing big things in the health care space takes time and careful attention. That is why we have spent the last year engaging in a beyond-the-beltway conversation. Now were moving forward with the legislative phase of this bold initiative . Next Thursday,
we will closely examine 21 st
Century Cures in a legislative hearing. This hearing will touch on our year-long listening tour and bipartisan negotiations. Make sure to watch the hearing
live here .
We are on the brink of something special. 21 st
Century Cures is all about providing hope to patients and families. We will continue to fight on their behalf.

Century Cures and other legislative issues please visit

God bless,
