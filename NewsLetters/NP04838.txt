Hi david,
I&rsquo;m Alex Ball, finance director for Cheri Bustos' re-elect.
I am reaching out today because there&rsquo;s exactly 4 days
left and polls show Bobby Schilling is trailing Cheri by just a
single-digit.
Looking at the budget for tonight's final ad buy, we still need $1,212 to hit our projections- but time is running out to complete our reservation.
We can&rsquo;t afford to miss this one. If you&rsquo;re able, will you please consider making a small contribution to Cheri's first re-election?
You can donate on our website:

A gift of any amount goes a long way.
Thank you,
Alex Ball Finance Director
Cheri Bustos for Congress
Paid for by Friends of Cheri Bustos
