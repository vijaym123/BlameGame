EPA reports decrease in toxic chemicals released in NMI - Nationwide, the Northern Mariana Islands had the second lowest amount of toxic chemicals released during 2013, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's annual Toxics Release Inventory
published this week. The amount of toxic chemicals released into the environment from facilities operating in the Northern Mariana Islands decreased significantly from 79,469 pounds in 2012 to 15,370 pounds in 2013. The Commonwealth Utilities Corporation and two petroleum bulk terminals on Saipan (Mariana Acquisition and Mobil Oil) were the three facilities releasing the most toxic chemicals. Eight facilities in all reported some release. TRI data is submitted annually by facilities in industry sectors such as manufacturing, metal mining, electric utilities, and commercial hazardous waste. Under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, facilities must report their toxic chemical releases for the prior year by July 1 of each year.
