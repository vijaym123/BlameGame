Congressman Lamborn Introduces Legislation to Prevent
Boycotts of Israel and Other Free Trade
Partners
Bill will
prevent US Government Contracts From Going to Participants in the BDS
Movement
11/18/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released
the following statement after his introduction of H.R.
5727:
Today I introduced H.R 5727 to
thwart efforts by Palestinian organizations to pressure different
corporations, companies and educational institutions to boycott, divest, and
sanction Israel. Sadly, just yesterday we heard that some in the
European Union are drafting new regulations with a similar aim. These
attacks and the falsehoods being spread about Israel are harmful to any
honest effort to bring peace to the
region.
My bill will require
that any prospective contractors with the U.S. Government will certify
that they are not boycotting a country with which the U.S. has a free
trade agreement. The bill also includes penalties for false
certifications, including the ability to ban companies that breach its parameters
from doing future business with the U.S. Government. Our government
business practices should not play any role in harming our greatest
ally in the Middle
East.
Israel is the only true democracy in the
Middle East, a place where all men and women enjoy freedom regardless of
their faith or ethnicity. In fact Jewish owned factories and
companies in Israel and in Judea and Samaria are among the chief employers of
the Palestinian community. Palestinian workers get equal pay and equal
treatment and enjoy
benefits.
To the Palestinian
leadership, if you are really interested in peace and morality, focus your
efforts on reducing the violent language being spread by your community
leaders and in your schools. Today, these incitements to violence killed
four and injured six innocent men at
prayer.

Lamborn (CO-05)
