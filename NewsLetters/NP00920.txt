Dear Friend,
Did you know that prior to the Great Recession of 2008, there wasnt a governing body that was responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector? The
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) was authorized by the
DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the financial crisis.
The fact is, we need a strong CFPB to help families, strengthen our financial marketplace and
ensure we never again see an economic downturn
like we did in 2008.
The CFPB makes markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americans
whether they are applying for a mortgage, choosing among credit cards, or using any number of other consumer financial products.
Show your support for the CFPB by
sharing on Facebook ,
Tweeting about it
or
forwarding this email to others .
I have fought to support the CFPB and reduce predatory lending, eliminate unnecessary costs, and make it less likely for mortgages to disintegrate in the hands of unsuspecting homeowners, even as some in Congress have repeatedly tried to scale back these basic protections.
We need banks and corporations to play by the same basic rules as small businesses and consumers.
Im proud to say that I stand strong with many in Congress who are united against efforts that weaken the law and roll back consumer protections.

WHAT THE CFPB CAN DO FOR YOU
The CFPB has created a number of personal finance tools for consumers that I find extremely helpful. Some of my favorites include:
Ask CFPB : Compiles plain-language answers to personal finance questions
Paying for College : Estimates the cost of attending specific universities based on the financial aid offers a student has received
Owning a Home : Check interest rates for your situation, understand loan options, and prepare a closing checklist
Protections Against Credit Discrimination : Learn about the protections you have against credit discrimination
Do you have further questions? My office is always here to help. Set up an appointment with one of my district congressional aides at 773-267-5926.
Sincerely,
Mike Quigley
