A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
May 8, 2015
This week, the Senate passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of
2015
, S.615, with overwhelming, bipartisan
support. The legislation requires the president to submit a final deal
with Iran
to Congress before reducing or removing
sanctions imposed on Iran. It will now be voted on by the U.S. House of
Representatives.
A nuclear-armed Iran is a danger not just to the Middle East but to the
peace and security of the entire world. Giving the Senate and the House
oversight on this agreement is absolutely essential to the American
people. We must be the eyes, the ears and the conscience of the people
we represent.
Balanced Budget
For the first time in more than a decade, the Republican-controlled
Senate took action this week to put our nation on track for a better
future by passing a 10-year balanced budget. Washington should follow
the example of Americas families and the middle class who manage their
budgets in a responsible way.
The newly enacted budget, which does not require the presidents
signature to take effect, calls for saving more than $5 trillion over
10 years and paves the way for the Republican Senate and House to send
legislation that repeals and replaces Obamacare to President Obamas
desk.
Trade Means Jobs for Georgians
Last week, I had the honor of delivering the Republican Weekly Address.
I spoke about the positive effects trade has on our state and the
impact of passing Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015
. Passage of this legislation will
help promote American workers and American jobs.
This legislation requires the president to consult with Congress before
final approval of any trade agreement. It does not guarantee approval
of any proposed trade agreement, but allows every trade agreement to be
scrutinized by your representatives and senators. Importantly, it also
ensures that trade agreements cannot override U.S. law. Enactment of
responsible trade legislation will strengthen the U.S. against
competitors like China and will allow us to negotiate fair trade
agreements that protect American workers, farmers, and manufacturers.
Fighting for Our National Defense
On Tuesday, I joined several of my Senate colleagues in supporting
efforts to prevent the Air Force from retiring the A-10
. Last week, the House voted to keep this
close-air support platform in our arsenal and next week, the Senate
Armed Services Committee will take up the same issue. Divesting this
aircraft without a qualified replacement would severely jeopardize the
safety of our men and women in uniform who rely on the A-10s close-air
support capabilities.
The A-10 is an important mission
at our own Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Ga., and plays a crucial
role in support of our national defense. The close-air support provided
by the A-10 is unmatched by any other aerial platform, and to stop
flying this aircraft without an alternative ready and in place would
put U.S. troops at an increased risk.
Open Office Day
On May 18, 2015, my field representative Daniela Belton will hold an
Open Office Day in Butts County
. Open office days make sure that the
views, concerns and local efforts of all Georgians are reflected in the
operation of my office.
Belton will be at the city of Jackson Municipal Court from 11:00 a.m.
until 1:00 p.m., and I encourage everyone in the area to come and talk
with her about any issues concerning the federal government, federal
legislation or federal agencies. Please check my website
for
opportunities in your area.
Small Business Week
It is National Small Business Week, and
I was honored with the Sm
all Business Council of Americas 2015
Congressional Award
on Wednesday for my work on behalf of
small businesses. As someone who ran a small business for two decades,
I understand the problems facing hardworking Americans who own, operate
or work for small businesses, and I do my best to effectively represent
them when making policy decisions.
Whats on Tap?
Tomorrow, I look forward to hosting more than 1,200 Georgians at our
annual Military Academy Day
at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta,
Ga.

Trade

Last
