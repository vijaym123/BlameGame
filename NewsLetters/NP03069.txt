Wicker: Federal Spending on an Unsustainable
Course
Interest Payments on Debt Are Poised to
Become Third-Largest
Expenditure
For 40 years, the independent Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) has provided economic analyses and cost estimates to assist
lawmakers when considering legislation.
One of its major reports
every year is a budget and economic outlook for the next decade.
Released just a few days ago, the new forecast warns that federal
spending is on an unsustainable course.
Gloomy Outlook for Debt,
Economic Growth
Among the
most significant takeaways from CBO's latest estimates is the
long-term rise in deficits, debt, and interest payments, which are expected to
skyrocket after 2018.
Unless things change, in 10 years the
federal debt will be a staggering $27.3 trillion, and annual interest
payments will grow to more than $800 billion.
By 2025, merely
paying interest on the federal debt will consume more of the budget than
every other expenditure except Social Security and Medicare.
Unprecedented debt levels do not bode
well for future economic growth.
CBO's projections were
similarly discouraging for growth and economic output, which is anticipated
to dwindle to 2.2 percent per year from 2020 through 2025.
As CBO
notes, this is significantly less than the average growth seen during
the 1980s and 1990s.
Obamacare remains a drag on the economy and a substantial source of
spending, costing $2 trillion over the next decade.
According to CBO,
the health-care law will force 10 million Americans off of their
employer-sponsored insurance plans, breaking one of the President's
promises and causing some 31 million people to remain
uninsured.
More Big-Government Spending From White
House
The CBO outlook comes just days before the
President is scheduled to submit his budget to Congress.
This
will be only the second time that President Obama has released a budget
by the deadline, which is the first Monday in February.
Required
by law, the White House budget is traditionally seen as the start of
the budget process, offering Congress recommendations as it prepares a
budget resolution of its
own.
Early news reports on the President's budget, however, indicate that he
will again kick the can down the road instead of proposing practical
budget cuts.
In keeping with the big-government rhetoric of this
year's State of the Union address, the President is expected to ignore
spending limits and instead suggest tax increases to pay for his
priorities.
Forcing Americans
to send more money to Washington is not the answer to our country's
debt problem or weak economy.
Middle-class Americans should not
shoulder the burden of this Administration's spending addiction.
Budget Committee Ready to Confront
Challenges
I am pleased that new Senate
Budget Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) is committed to making tough decisions
about how to rein in spending and lower the deficit.
As a
member of the committee, I look forward to his leadership as we craft a
budget resolution this year.
Taxpayers deserve a blueprint that
eliminates government waste, slows the growth of entitlement programs,
promotes accountability, and mirrors their priorities.
American
families work to balance their budgets, and Washington should, too.
The CBO report is a
clear indicator of the dire financial situation we will face if we do not
confront our budget challenges without delay.
Today, every
American owes $56,000 on the federal debt, which has surged to more than
$18 trillion.
This is not the time for political theater or
grandstanding.
Seriously addressing this long-term problem has become
an urgent and moral imperative for current generations and those that
follow.
