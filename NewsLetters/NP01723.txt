Sorry if this email is overly direct. But we need you to chip in $5 (or more if you can) right now.
Here&rsquo;s why:
Cheri is the MOST vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
Her first public fundraising deadline of the election is TONIGHT.
And as of 1 pm, she&rsquo;s in serious danger of missing her $1OO,OOO goal.
We know we ask a lot, David. But we need to make sure Cheri has the resources to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s campaign machine -- and that starts by hitting this fundraising deadline out of the park. So, we&rsquo;re asking. Can you chip in $5 to help us close the gap? Every dollar helps.
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

We&rsquo;re so thankful for your support.
Team Bustos
P.S. We&rsquo;re relying on grassroots supporters like you to hit tonight&rsquo;s critical $1OO,OOO goal.
Will you donate $5 or more right now?
