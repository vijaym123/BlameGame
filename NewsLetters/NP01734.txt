Brothers Andy and Theo Leblanc from South Portland came to my office as
youth ambassadors for the Tourette Syndrome Association.
I met with members of the Maine Veterans of Foreign Wars to discuss
issues facing our veterans.
If you're ever in Washington on a Wednesday when the Senate is in
session, come on by my office for Capitol Coffee!
Maine sure was well-represented in the United States Senate Youth
Program. Congratulations to Muna Mohamed of Lewiston and Andrew
Sandweiss of Bangor.
Two wonderful people were inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame
- Dr. Barbara Woodlee, former President of Kennebec Valley Community
College, and Ellen Golden, Senior Vice President at Coastal Enterprises
Inc.
Jefferson Liu, who has translated books about Joshua Chamberlain into
Chinese, came by Capitol Coffee earlier this month.
It was snowing on the day of the Arctic hearing held by the Energy
Committee, so I needed my L.L. Bean jacket.
Report from Maine
I I joined with officials at the Wells Reserve at Laudholm
to officially launch its new solar array system, which will generate
enough electricity to meet all of its energy needs. Wells Reserve is
the first non-profit in Maine to operate solely on solar energy.
I ran in to this little guy at the Maine Sportsman's Show in Augusta.
The show is always a great chance to learn more about outdoor
recreation in our state, to see some old friends, and to make some new
ones.
I toured the Maine Veterans Home in Bangor
, where I called on Congress to maintain funding for
construction grants to improve infrastructure at veterans homes across
the country.
Report from Washington
George and Donna Gunning of Windsor and
Burt Truman of Hallowell have made almost 2,500 personalized eagle
canes for Maine veterans
. I spoke on the Senate
floor about this amazing initiative that continues to mean so much for
veterans in our state.
Patrick Arnold, the Director of Operations and Business Development for
the Maine Port Authority, testified before the Senate Energy Committee
about the importance of the
Arctic to Maine and the nation. This month, Senator Lisa Murkowski
(R-Alaska) and I announced the creation of an Arctic Caucus
in order to spotlight this region and open up a wider
conversation about our future there.
Earlier this month, I spoke on the Senate floor
about the importance
of putting aside politics when it comes to the Iran nuclear
negotiations.
Policy Update
*
After a series of late-night votes, the Senate passed its 2016
budget resolution. I voted against it because it does not take a
balanced approach to governing. What this country deserves is a
sensible budget that reforms entitlements while protecting
beneficiaries, closes tax loopholes without raising taxes on the middle
class, and maintains investments that will strengthen our country. You
can read more HERE
.
*
Thousands of people in Maine face fines for missing ACA
deadlines, but thanks to a special ACA enrollment period that started
on March 15 and runs until April 30,
they have an opportunity to avoid some of those
fines and move one step closer to quality, affordable health coverage.
*
Following a push from Senator Collins and me, the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has announced that it will make
critical changes in the way eligibility is determined
for
the Veterans Choice Program. While this is a start, our work to support
our veterans is not finished.
*
The Senate Intelligence Committee, of which I'm a member,
approved cyber-security legislation
by a bipartisan
vote of 14 to 1. I have been an advocate of passing a cyber-security
bill, and urge my colleagues to take this up on the Senate floor
without delay.
