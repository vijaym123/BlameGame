Thanking
Those Who Serve
Dear Friend,
As we observe Memorial Day, we remember
with gratitude all of those brave men and
women who have defended our great nation,
and we pay tribute to those who have made
the ultimate sacrifice. To all of those who
are and have been members of our armed
forces
thank you for all that you
do in the name of American liberty.
As Americans, we must continue to
support our troops who bravely defend our
interests both at home and abroad. We must
always remember that it is because of their
service and sacrifice that we live in the
most free and prosperous nation on
earth.
With this at the forefront of our minds,
last week, the House of Representatives
passed six bills to work towards ensuring
our veterans receive the care they have
earned. These bills include efforts to
reduce veteran homelessness, encourage the
creation of more job opportunities for
veterans, and improve accountability of
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
employees. We are taking significant
legislative steps and conducting rigorous
oversight to improve the care our veterans
receive, but we cannot change the culture
of the VA alone. The Administration must do
more to meet the benchmarks set by
Congress.
This week marks one year since General
Eric Shinseki resigned as the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs. While his resignation
seemed like the first step toward turning
the VA around, the agency has not yet met
the American peoples expectations
for quality service for our veterans.
Congress gave the Secretary of the VA
greater authority to fire the employees
responsible for the agencys
mismanagement, but in the past year,
few
VA employees
have been fired. Congress
authorized
$16
billion in additional spending
at the
VA over three years to address backlogs,
yet far too many veterans continue to face
excessively
long wait times
to get appointments and
receive care. And we recently learned that
the
VA
may have illegally spent
as much as $6
billion on improper acquisitions. It is
clear that the culture of the VA remains
one of bureaucracy and paper-pushing, not
one of duty and service that our veterans
deserve.
We in the House remain committed to
holding the VA accountable and ensuring our
veterans receive the level of care and
service worthy of their tremendous
sacrifice. We will continue to conduct
oversight to push the VA to raise their
standards and will pursue additional
legislative reforms as needed. This week, I
will be traveling Virginias Fifth
District to meet with veterans from South
Hill to Warrenton. I am looking forward to
thanking these great Americans, and I hope
to gain their insights into how Congress
can best help those who stood ready to lay
down their lives for our country.
I am honored to represent so many
veterans and active duty soldiers in
Virginias Fifth District. I recorded
a video message to commemorate Memorial
Day, which you can view on my website
hurt.house.gov .
I join the people of the Fifth District in
honoring those who have fallen and in
offering our thanks to those service
members who have served and continue to
serve this great nation so that we may
continue to preserve our American way of
life for future generations.
