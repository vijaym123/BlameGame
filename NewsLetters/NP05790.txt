URGENT: CONTROL OF CONGRESS IS AT STAKE Tomorrow's ad buy deadline may be our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
We just don&rsquo;t know what else to do:
-- The latest polls show we&rsquo;re DEADLOCKED in the race for Congress.
-- Our grassroots fundraising is stronger than ever (much stronger than Republicans).
-- But Republicans are STILL going to massively outspend us in the coming week. The math is daunting:
if we don&rsquo;t have the resources to fight back in tough races across the country, our chances of winning will drop to ZERO. That might sound grim, but it&rsquo;s the truth.
Tomorrow night marks a critical ad buy deadline for us -- exactly 4 weeks left to go. It&rsquo;s our last chance to turn things around and have President Obama&rsquo;s back in this election.
David, we&rsquo;re urging you -- please don&rsquo;t wait until tomorrow. We need you to chip in today.
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO
