We&rsquo;re still coming up short.
Tonight is the final federal fundraising deadline of this election. And let me repeat: we&rsquo;re still coming up short.
We wouldn&rsquo;t be asking if it wasn&rsquo;t important. This week, Boehner&rsquo;s allies are spending $17 million attacking us. We&rsquo;re getting completely outspent.
Control of Congress is at stake. President Obama&rsquo;s agenda is on the line. And if we can&rsquo;t pull it together TODAY, we&rsquo;re going to get demolished.
I&rsquo;m begging, David.
We need 10 donors from 60659 zip code to step up before the deadline.
Can you chip in today?
