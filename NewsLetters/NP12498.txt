FROM THE DESK OF CONGRESSMAN YOHO
Friends,
Recently, I did a tele-town hall with a number of veterans in the 3rd
District. It was an honor to speak to so many heroes and hear what is
on their minds. Since the House passed the budget and omnibus bills,
I've heard from many who still have questions about what these pieces
of legislation actually mean for veterans.
You know I'm a big fan of the truth, so let's talk about it.
Here's the first thing that was very important that both of these bills
got right.
Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution clearly
states that, "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in
Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."
This work of genius was deliberate on the part of our Constitutional
framers. They intended for Congress, and in particular the House of
Representatives, to have clear oversight over appropriations bills so
that we may cut, amend, and change the legislation as we would any
other bill. They wanted us to have strict oversight over how your tax
dollars are spent. Sadly, we've moved away from that Constitutionally
intended process and have passed what are called Continuing
Resolutions, which are rubber stamps on current spending. These bills
lack true Constitutional oversight and transparency and move us away
from the way our budgetary process was intended--which causes more debt
and more spending. You only need to look at the exponential increase in
our debt to see that the status quo clearly is not working. Something
needed to change.
I came to Washington to stop perpetuating the status quo and get us
back to a more Constitutional process. By putting spending bills
through the proper process, taxpayers get much needed oversight,
transparency, and control over how their money is spent. If this budget
and omnibus bill failed, we would have reverted back to crisis spending
and stop-gap measures that add more and more to the debt. I voted for
the budget and omnibus package to get us back to a regular budget
process that put Congress back in control of spending.
One of the most heartbreaking rumors I've been hearing is that these
votes harmed our nation's veterans.
There are more than 120,000
veterans in North Central Florida, and I've said time and again we have
promises to keep to them and our troops.
This legislation provided a much needed 1% raise in salary for our
troops; as well as funding for veterans healthcare, military readiness
and equipment, and funding to get rid of the VA disability backlog. The
backlog of claims at the VA is one of the most persistent and ongoing
issues I've heard from folks in the 3rd District. Many of our veterans
have waited years to get their benefits. This is simply wrong. This
legislation not only provided funds to tackle this backlog, it created
a plan to eliminate it by the end of 2015. It is also estimated that
6.5 million veterans will be treated this year. The omnibus bill
provided $43.6 billion to care for these heroes.
A lot of people think that the 1% reduction in the COLA increase for
working age veterans equates to a cut in their benefits.
This does not
affect medically retired personnel or recipients of the survivor
benefit plan; and any changes do not take effect until 2016. This is
very important. First, this was specifically done so that Congress has
time to make changes based on the recommendations of the Military
Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission whose report will
come out before the changes take place. Secondly, it was constructed so
that veteran COLAs are not the first pensions that are affected.
Beginning this year, new Federal employees have begun contributing more
to their own pensions. And third, after a veteran reaches the age of 62
it reverts back to the original COLA calculation.
Additionally, Congress has already introduced a number of pieces of
legislation to repeal any changes to veterans' pensions. I am a
cosponsor of legislation to go after fraudulent payments in the IRS
that go to folks who are here illegally. This alone would save
billions, and those funds would be put towards veterans' pensions to
negate any changes. I am also working on my own legislation to apply
similar changes to Members of Congress, the President and
Administration, and other Federal employees. If I am going to ask
anyone to make changes to their pension, I have to be willing to make
changes to mine.
In addition to important funds for the VA and our troops, this
appropriations bill cut funding to the IRS by $526 million, blocked a
pay-raise for the Vice President and senior political appointees, cut
$143 million from the EPA, rejected a $72 million dollar proposal from
the President for EPA regulatory programs, prohibited aid to Libya
until they cooperate with the Benghazi investigation, and restricted
the NSA's ability to collect the communications of American citizens.
Had I voted no, I would have voted against these important reforms.
Because of Affordable Care Act, we have every reason to be wary of big
bills that come through Congress. This was not an easy vote for that
very reason.
That's why I understand why there is some misinformation
out there about the budget and spending measures we passed, because
even I disagreed with some of the things that ultimately became law.
Having a regular budget and appropriations stops these large omnibus
bills from happening in the future and puts control back where it needs
to be-with individual Members of Congress. Whether you agree or
disagree with my support of the reforms I've outlined, I hope I've shed
some light on why I voted the way that I did. As always, it is my goal
to keep you as informed as possible.
Best,
Ted

FROM
THE
DESK
OF
CONGRESSMAN
YOHO
Friends,
Recently,
I
did
a
tele-town
hall
with
a
number
of
veterans
in
the
3rd
District.
It
was
an
honor
to
speak
to
so
many
heroes
and
hear
what
is
on
their
minds.
Since
the
House
passed
the
budget
and
omnibus
bills,
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
who
still
have
questions
about
what
these
pieces
of
legislation
actually
mean
for
veterans.
You
know
I&#8217;m
a
big
fan
of
the
truth,
so
let&#8217;s
talk
about
it.
Here&#8217;s
the
first
thing
that
was
very
important
that
both
of
these
bills
got
right.
Article
1,
Section
9,
Clause
7
of
the
Constitution
clearly
states
that,
&#8220;No
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
Treasury,
but
in
Consequence
of
Appropriations
made
by
Law&#8230;&#8221;
This
work
of
genius
was
deliberate
on
the
part
of
our
Constitutional
framers.
They
intended
for
Congress,
and
in
particular
the
House
of
Representatives,
to
have
clear
oversight
over
appropriations
bills
so
that
we
may
cut,
amend,
and
change
the
legislation
as
we
would
any
other
bill.
They
wanted
us
to
have
strict
oversight
over
how
your
tax
dollars
are
spent.
Sadly,
we&#8217;ve
moved
away
from
that
Constitutionally
intended
process
and
have
passed
what
are
called
Continuing
Resolutions,
which
are
rubber
stamps
on
current
spending.
These
bills
lack
true
Constitutional
oversight
and
transparency
and
move
us
away
from
the
way
our
budgetary
process
was
intended--which
causes
more
debt
and
more
spending.
You
only
need
to
look
at
the
exponential
increase
in
our
debt
to
see
that
the
status
quo
clearly
is
not
working.
Something
needed
to
change.
I
came
to
Washington
to
stop
perpetuating
the
status
quo
and
get
us
back
to
a
more
Constitutional
process.
By
putting
spending
bills
through
the
proper
process,
taxpayers
get
much
needed
oversight,
transparency,
and
control
over
how
their
money
is
spent.
If
this
budget
and
omnibus
bill
failed,
we
would
have
reverted
back
to
crisis
spending
and
stop-gap
measures
that
add
more
and
more
to
the
debt.
I
voted
for
the
budget
and
omnibus
package
to
get
us
back
to
a
regular
budget
process
that
put
Congress
back
in
control
of
spending.
One
of
the
most
heartbreaking
rumors
I&#8217;ve
been
hearing
is
that
these
votes
harmed
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans.
There
are
more
than
120,000
veterans
in
North
Central
Florida,
and
I&#8217;ve
said
time
and
again
we
have
promises
to
keep
to
them
and
our
troops.
This
legislation
provided
a
much
needed
1%
raise
in
salary
for
our
troops;
as
well
as
funding
for
veterans
healthcare,
military
readiness
and
equipment,
and
funding
to
get
rid
of
the
VA
disability
backlog.
The
backlog
of
claims
at
the
VA
is
one
of
the
most
persistent
and
ongoing
issues
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
folks
in
the
3rd
District.
Many
of
our
veterans
have
waited
years
to
get
their
benefits.
This
is
simply
wrong.
This
legislation
not
only
provided
funds
to
tackle
this
backlog,
it
created
a
plan
to
eliminate
it
by
the
end
of
2015.
It
is
also
estimated
that
6.5
million
veterans
will
be
treated
this
year.
The
omnibus
bill
provided
$43.6
billion
to
care
for
these
heroes.
A
lot
of
people
think
that
the
1%
reduction
in
the
COLA
increase
for
working
age
veterans
equates
to
a
cut
in
their
benefits.
This
does
not
affect
medically
retired
personnel
or
recipients
of
the
survivor
benefit
plan;
and
any
changes
do
not
take
effect
until
2016.
This
is
very
important.
First,
this
was
specifically
done
so
that
Congress
has
time
to
make
changes
based
on
the
recommendations
of
the
Military
Compensation
and
Retirement
Modernization
Commission
whose
report
will
come
out
before
the
changes
take
place.
Secondly,
it
was
constructed
so
that
veteran
COLAs
are
not
the
first
pensions
that
are
affected.
Beginning
this
year,
new
Federal
employees
have
begun
contributing
more
to
their
own
pensions.
And
third,
after
a
veteran
reaches
the
age
of
62
it
reverts
back
to
the
original
COLA
calculation.
Additionally,
Congress
has
already
introduced
a
number
of
pieces
of
legislation
to
repeal
any
changes
to
veterans&#8217;
pensions.
I
am
a
cosponsor
of
legislation
to
go
after
fraudulent
payments
in
the
IRS
that
go
to
folks
who
are
here
illegally.
This
alone
would
save
billions,
and
those
funds
would
be
put
towards
veterans&#8217;
pensions
to
negate
any
changes.
I
am
also
working
on
my
own
legislation
to
apply
similar
changes
to
Members
of
Congress,
the
President
and
Administration,
and
other
Federal
employees.
If
I
am
going
to
ask
anyone
to
make
changes
to
their
pension,
I
have
to
be
willing
to
make
changes
to
mine.
In
addition
to
important
funds
for
the
VA
and
our
troops,
this
appropriations
bill
cut
funding
to
the
IRS
by
$526
million,
blocked
a
pay-raise
for
the
Vice
President
and
senior
political
appointees,
cut
$143
million
from
the
EPA,
rejected
a
$72
million
dollar
proposal
from
the
President
for
EPA
regulatory
programs,
prohibited
aid
to
Libya
until
they
cooperate
with
the
Benghazi
investigation,
and
restricted
the
NSA&#8217;s
ability
to
collect
the
communications
of
American
citizens.
Had
I
voted
no,
I
would
have
voted
against
these
important
reforms.
Because
of
Affordable
Care
Act,
we
have
every
reason
to
be
wary
of
big
bills
that
come
through
Congress.
This
was
not
an
easy
vote
for
that
very
reason.
That&#8217;s
why
I
understand
why
there
is
some
misinformation
out
there
about
the
budget
and
spending
measures
we
passed,
because
even
I
disagreed
with
some
of
the
things
that
ultimately
became
law.
Having
a
regular
budget
and
appropriations
stops
these
large
omnibus
bills
from
happening
in
the
future
and
puts
control
back
where
it
needs
to
be&#8212;with
individual
Members
of
Congress.
Whether
you
agree
or
disagree
with
my
support
of
the
reforms
I&#8217;ve
outlined,
I
hope
I&#8217;ve
shed
some
light
on
why
I
voted
the
way
that
I
did.
As
always,
it
is
my
goal
to
keep
you
as
informed
as
possible.
Best,
Ted
