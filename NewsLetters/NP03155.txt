Dear David,
The House has sent over the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security funding bill, which deals with a very
important question: does the law matter, or not?
On more
than 22 separate occasions, President Obama admitted he didn't have the
authority to do what he now has done with his executive
amnesty.
The president still does not possess that authority
today.
I
talked
about my support for
the House-passed bill today to stop President Obama's lawless power
grab.
Sometimes you don't know how these legislative battles go if
you don't have them - and we intend to have this one.

to watch my remarks today.
I
re-introduced
my bill, the "ENFORCE the Law" Act, to ensure the president
cannot continue blatantly disregarding the nation's laws and the
Constitution.
In December, I also joined an
amicus brief
led by Senator Cruz and co-signed by Senator Cornyn
supporting a lawsuit brought by the State of Texas against President
Obama's illegal amnesty.
I think we should do everything
we can to persuade at least a half dozen Democrats to join us to stop
President Obama's amnesty.
As always, I invite you to
join the conversation online by sharing your thoughts with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter , on
Instagram , and by subscribing to my

Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
