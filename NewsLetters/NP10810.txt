Hello Friends!
With only a little over
one week left to file your taxes, I want to ensure you have the
information you need. Visit the Wisconsin Department of Revenue for the
correct form and answers to your questions. You can also file your taxes
for free using the IRS Free File program. Do you need help with your
taxes? Click below!
The Earned Income Tax Credit is a credit for people who work and
earn less than 51,567. It is also called EITC or EIC. Do you qualify?

Also check out IRS Free File! Everyone can use
it!
Are you a millionaire? No? Unfortunately, the House Republican
budget plan seeks to only help the wealthy through tax cuts and tax
loopholes. Everyone else could pay for it through tax increases and drastic
reductions to critical domestic investments.

I spoke during the GOP budget markup to stand up for the poor and
working class. The GOP budget strikes fear in the hearts of vulnerable
populations.
I ended my night speaking out against House Republicans who falsely
characterize those receiving food assistance.
As your voice in Congress, I will do all I can to speak
out against injustice. As always, please contact my Milwaukee office
at (414) 297-1140 or my Washington, DC office at (202) 225-4572 with
any questions or concerns. Stay in
touch!
My very
best,
Gwen
