Dear Friend:
Today I led a group of Senate colleagues in introducing the Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act to prohibit the marketing of e-cigarettes to children and teens.
Despite claims from some e-cigarette makers that they do not market their products to children, e-cigarette manufacturers are using the same marketing schemes once used by big tobacco companies to market regular cigarettes to kids and teens &ndash; including flavoring their products in candy and fruit flavors and using cartoon characters that appeal to children.
Studies show that for many young users, e-cigarettes could be a gateway to nicotine addiction and smoking of conventional cigarettes. We cannot risk undoing decades of progress in reducing youth smoking by allowing e-cigarette makers to target our kids. To learn more, please click

Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
