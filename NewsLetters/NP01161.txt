Amending the 2016 NDAA
On Wednesday, May 29th, Congressman Doug Lamborn took part in an
eighteen and a half hour mark-up amendment session for the FY2016
National Defense Authorization Act in the House Armed Services Committee.
Congressman Lamborn had 14 amendments adopted into the final language
of the bill, in addition to work on the underlying language in the
bill and amendments in subcommittee. The bill now moves to the floor of
the House for a final passage vote in the near future and the
opportunity to add more amendments to the
legislation.
"My proposed
amendments and efforts on the language of the bill itself are vital to the
security of our nation and build on and support our important
alliances and partnerships in an increasingly dangerous
world."

Congressman Lamborn 2016 NDAA Amendments &amp;
Initiatives
Worked in the House Armed Services Committee to add $6 million to
the Army Reserve budget in the National Defense Authorization Act for
the new cybersecurity partnership program. The University of Colorado
Colorado Springs and five other nationally recognized universities
have partnered with the U.S. Army Reserve to create the new Cybersecurity
Public Private Partnership program (Cyber P3). The $6 million secured
by Congressman Lamborn provides full funding for this program in its
inaugural year of
operation.
Partnered with Congresswoman Gwen
Graham (FL-02) on an amendment authorizing research and development of an
anti-tunneling defense system with Israel to protect from terrorist
attacks and border incursions. The amendment, which combines language
from H.R. 1349 and H.R. 1649, is similar to the 2011 legislative
authorization for the highly successful Iron Dome Anti-Missile Defense System,
which has stopped more than 1,200 rockets from hitting Israel. The
bipartisan legislation is endorsed by AIPAC, the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee. In addition to helping Israel secure its borders,
the anti-tunneling defense technology discovered in this joint project
could also be used to protect American military bases and our nations
borders with Mexico and
Canada.
Added an amendment requiring the
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on Turkeys fight against
terrorism, including foreign fighter flow and their harboring of
Hamas.
Added a provision in the Iran Military Power Report looking at the
transfer of Russian military technology to Iran, including the S-300
anti-aircraft missile
system.
Added an amendment requiring the Secretary
of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the military posture
required in the Middle East to deter Iran from developing a nuclear
weapon.
Added amendments expressing the Sense of Congress regarding the American
ability to assure the use of space and to ensure a strong missile
defense system and space sensor
network.
Added an amendment directing an
assessment of the industrial base of the directed energy
field.
Added an
amendment directing the Department of Defense to review the small
business implications of using the OASIS contract
vehicle.
Added an amendment
directing the GAO to review the prevalence of cancelled contract
solicitations and the wasted investment resulting from cancelled
solicitations.
