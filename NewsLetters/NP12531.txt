Budget
Report Paints Disturbing Picture
Dear Friend,
Last week, the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released
a report containing a number of troubling
findings for our economy, our
governments finances, and,
ultimately, our children and grandchildren.
The CBO report found that the
Presidents health care law will have
a tremendous and negative impact on our
economy over the next ten years by
encouraging Americans not to work. The CBO
estimates that the Presidents
healthcare law will result in the
equivalent of 2.5 million Americans leaving
the full-time workforce. Once again, the
American people are reminded of yet another
harmful effect of this misguided law that
is hurting our country
slower
growth and fewer jobs.
At a time when participation in our
labor force is near its lowest point in
thirty years, the last thing we need is a
policy that encourages people not to work.
Our great nation was founded on the
principles that a free people naturally
desire to provide for themselves and their
families and that when the government
controls the economy of a nation, it
diminishes the freedoms of the people. At
its heart, a policy that discourages work
and encourages government dependence
diminishes the freedom of every American.
That is why we in the House of
Representatives have continued to focus on
policies that address the need for more
jobs and more growth, including mitigating
the harmful impacts of the
presidents health care law.
The CBO report also informs us that our
deficit and debt problems remain very
serious. Though revenues are higher than
ever, the days of trillion dollar deficits
will return if we do not change course. Our
debt is on pace to grow to $27 trillion in
the next ten years. We pay hundreds of
billions of dollars in interest on the
national debt every year, and that amount
will quadruple over the next decade.
We have taken some small, positive steps
in recent years to cut spending and reform
unsustainable government programs. Yet we
must take further action to rein in the
programs that represent over $100 trillion
in unfunded liabilities for future
generations because this burden will
bankrupt our country if we do not act. We
also need to break through the sluggish
growth we have experienced in recent years
and replace that with dynamic economic
growth that will create many more new jobs.
The combination of growth and responsible
reforms will steer our country away from
bankruptcy and decline toward a path to
opportunity, prosperity, and success for
all.
Though the findings of this weeks
CBO report are troubling, I view it as a
renewed call to promote the policies we
need to deliver a brighter future to our
children and grandchildren.
