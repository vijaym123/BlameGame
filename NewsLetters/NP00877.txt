Friend
Law enforcement officers put duty before self, working on the front lines to protect our homes, our communities, our children, and our lives.
While it is hard to convey our gratitude for such sacrifice, uniting as a country to recognize National Police Week this week affords us an opportunity to commemorate the dedication of these special patriots. We are truly grateful.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. Recently, a bill I cosponsored called the National Blue Alert Act of 2015 ( S. 665 ) passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, and is now headed to the Presidents desk to become law. This bill will create a national Blue Alert communications network within the Justice Department, tasked with integrating existing and future Blue Alert systems throughout the United States. Im pleased that this legislation passed, and I will continue working to increase public safety and ensure proper protection for our law enforcement officers and first responders.
