Christmas is the time of year we celebrate the birth of our Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ. But the celebration of the season is more than
that for many - it's also the time of year where hopeful children
across the country are writing letters to Santa with their Christmas
wish lists, and adults are focusing on the hope and new beginnings that
the New Year will bring. Which is what prompted me to create my own DC
Christmas Wish List.
These are not the kind of presents that will fit under the Christmas
tree, but rather the many things I hope to see accomplished in the New
Year.
Each day, I'm posting a new wish on Facebook. Here's what I've wished
for thus far:
1. Uncover the truth behind the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack
2. Free Pastor Saeed Abedini
3. Pass the Manufactured Housing bill to ensure access to affordable
housing in rural communities across America
4. End taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood
5. That the NSA follow the U.S. Constitution
6. Stop China's currency manipulation
7. Ensure the IRS is never again used as a political weapon to
intimidate individuals and political organizations
8. Have a safe and secure Israel
9. Have a simpler, fairer and flatter tax code

as I reveal my biggest wishes for 2014 over the
next few days, and share with me what you want to see Washington
deliver in 2014. You can also tweet your wishes by using the hashtag
#DCWishList
.
We have a lot to accomplish in the New Year, so I'm excited to see your
wishes.

Christmas
is
the
time
of
year
we
celebrate
the
birth
of
our
Lord
and
Savior,
Jesus
Christ.
But
the
celebration
of
the
season
is
more
than
that
for
many
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
also
the
time
of
year
where
hopeful
children
across
the
country
are
writing
letters
to
Santa
with
their
Christmas
wish
lists,
and
adults
are
focusing
on
the
hope
and
new
beginnings
that
the
New
Year
will
bring.
Which
is
what
prompted
me
to
create
my
own
DC
Christmas
Wish
List.
These
are
not
the
kind
of
presents
that
will
fit
under
the
Christmas
tree,
but
rather
the
many
things
I
hope
to
see
accomplished
in
the
New
Year.
Each
day,
I'm
posting
a
new
wish
on
Facebook.
Here's
what
I've
wished
for
thus
far:
1.
Uncover
the
truth
behind
the
2012
Benghazi
terrorist
attack 2.
Free
Pastor
Saeed
Abedini 3.
Pass
the
Manufactured
Housing
bill
to
ensure
access
to
affordable
housing
in
rural
communities
across
America 4.
End
taxpayer
funding
of
Planned
Parenthood 5.
That
the
NSA
follow
the
U.S.
Constitution 6.
Stop
China&#8217;s
currency
manipulation 7.
Ensure
the
IRS
is
never
again
used
as
a
political
weapon
to
intimidate
individuals
and
political
organizations 8.
Have
a
safe
and
secure
Israel 9.
Have
a
simpler,
fairer
and
flatter
tax
code
