All you have to do is read a newspaper or magazine and there
is a good chance you will find an example of out of control spending in
our nations capital.
Families across our district, state and
country make sacrifices with their spending, but the federal government
never seems to want to cut any spending.
I recently
came across an article in the
Washington Free Beacon
about
the National Science Foundation (NSF) spending $300,000 to study humans
and bikes with the goal to come up with a new plan to encourage more
Americans to ride bicycles to lower their carbon footprints.
While the amount of money might sound small, this is just one example of
the government wasting your tax dollars.
Science, Space and
Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas called this $300,000
study unnecessary and said, The NSF has gone off the road, and taxpayers
are paying for it.
Scarce public funds were awarded for an
ill-conceived study to improve bicycle designs.
Peddling their
proposal, the researchers asserted that bicycle riding dynamics are poorly
understood. Yet bicycling is a $65 billion per year global industry
that invests hundreds of millions in research and development.
Whats really poorly understood is why the NSF wasted $300,000 of
taxpayer money on this project.
The $300,000 waste of
taxpayer dollars is a drop in the bucket, but these wasteful spending
activities of the government adds up to lots of money over time.
This is why I have been working to rein in out of control spending and
put this country on a budget.
The easiest way to rein
in out of control spending is actually adopting a budget.
In
April, the House passed H. Con. Res. 96, also known as the Ryan budget,
which would reduce spending by $5.1 trillion over ten years and
balance the budget.
It does this while protecting important government
functions such as defense spending and veterans benefits.
The
budget resolution repeals the presidents health care law, including
the laws tax increases, and calls for fundamental tax reform.
The
House budget blueprint gives states more flexibility to tailor
programs to their peoples needs and protects the promises made to senior
citizens.
In April, I also voted in favor of the
budget plan developed by the Republican Study Committee (RSC), which
would have accelerated the return to balanced budgets. The RSC proposed
budget would balance in four years and freezes discretionary spending
at $950 billion, pre-2008 levels until the budget is balanced.
This proposal also repeals the presidents health care law replacing
it with the
American Health Care Reform Act . The RSC
budget was proposed as an alternative to the Ryan budget.
The RSC
plan contained more aggressive spending controls which would solve many
of our fiscal problems on a faster timetable.
However, the RSC
budget failed to pass the House of Representatives when it was
considered in April.
Putting the U.S. government on an actual
budget would go a long way to reining in out of control spending like the
NSF using $300,000 to study humans and bicycles.
American
families have to budget and make the difficult choices with their finances,
and Washington should do the same.
