A Little
Context
Today, President Obama released his Fiscal Year 2016
budget proposal. There will be an opportunity to review the details and
discuss the presidents plan at a hearing later this week in the House
Budget Committee. In the meantime, it is important to put this debate
over the nations fiscal and economic challenges in context. That was
made easier this past week when the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
released its latest Budget and Economic Outlook
report.
The CBO projects a $468 billion deficit for
2015. According to the report, the recent decline in annual deficits
will end and deficits will start rising again in 2017, reaching $1.1
trillion in 2025. Another $9.5 trillion will be added to the national
debt by the end of the decade
bringing the total to over $27 trillion.
Thats the current course we are on right
now.
CBOs analysis is a sober reminder of whats at
stake if nothing is done to stop the nation from going down this
unsustainable path. Our vital health and retirement programs will continue to
grow further toward insolvency as spending on Social Security,
Medicare, and Medicaid will each nearly double by 2025. Perhaps most
disturbing is the projected economic growth that will average just 2.3 percent
annually over the next 10 years
below the historical average of 3.3
percent.
This new normal is
unacceptable, and it will mean less opportunity for American families
and job creators now and in the years to come. But, theres no reason
it has to be this way. With innovative thinking, real accountability,
and more efficient and effective policies, we can solve our fiscal
challenges while restoring strength and confidence to our economy. In the
plan the House Budget Committee will be putting out later this year,
we will advance serious solutions and focus on real results, not empty
promises. We can stop the nation from drowning further in debt, and,
in doing so, lay the foundation for a healthy economy that can benefit
all Americans.
