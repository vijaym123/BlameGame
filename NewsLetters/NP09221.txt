Great Lakes Region to Receive Federal Grants to Assist with Conservation Efforts
U.S. Department of Agriculture to designate Great Lakes as a Critical Conservation Area eligible for federal grants to help farmers implement conservation practices
Washington &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative
Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement on the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s designation of the Great Lakes Basin as a Critical Conservation Area under the $2.4 billion Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) established by the Farm
Bill:
&quot;Our Great Lakes are the source of drinking water for nearly 40 million people worldwide.
They support 1.5 million jobs
and account for $62 billion in wages annually. The region also generates more than $15 billion in agricultural output &#8211; 7 percent of the total U.S. food production.
&#8220;As stewards of these magnificent Lakes, we must protect them and ensure that they continue to thrive and provide for the
millions who rely on their precious resources.
This designation, which dedicates funding for our region&#8217;s water and soil conservation efforts, will help our farmers further their efforts to protect our Lakes while simultaneously protecting their ability to
provide an abundant food supply.&#8221;
Background:
Established by the 2014 Farm Bill (the
Agricultural Act of 2014),
RCPP promotes coordination between the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and its partners to deliver conservation assistance to producers and landowners.
As a Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force,
Rep. Miller wrote to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack in April
urging the Department to designate the Great Lakes as a Critical Conservation Area, highlighting the need to protect the Lakes as the world&#8217;s largest provider of fresh
water.
