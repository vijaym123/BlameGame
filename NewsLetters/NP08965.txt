Congressional Report for Week of June 2-6:
Cybersecurity Jobs
for Veterans
Hello Friend,
I spent this week working in the 23rd District of Texas - mostly in San
Antonio and Del Rio. Today, though, I'm home in Alpine and Fort Davis.
While in San Antonio, I toured the Boeing plant, visited a skilled
nursing facility and honored students who have been accepted to the
various U.S. Military Academies. In Del Rio, I spoke to the Class of
2014 as they graduated from high school and began the next phase of
their life. I'll head back to Washington on Monday for another week of
hearings, votes and meetings.
Our field offices were busy as well.
Field Representatives visited
Marfa, Fort Stockton, Alpine, Marathon, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Carrizo
Springs and north and Southside San Antonio.

Amendment Supporting Cybersecurity Jobs for Veterans Passes House
Presented Congressional Certificate of Recognition to Chef Johnny
Stewart of McCollum High School
Remembering Alex and Maritza Alvarez - and Learning From Them
Amendment Supporting Cybersecurity Jobs for Veterans Passes House
Just before leaving Washington, the House passed the Intelligence
Authorization Act for fiscal years 2014-15. I was the only Democrat
authorized to offer an individual floor amendment. The amendment helps
veterans and retired members of the intelligence community gain
employment in the cybersecurity sector. The top ranking Republican and
Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence both
spoke in support of my amendment. I'm proud to say the amendment was
adopted unanimously.
We owe veterans a more than a debt of gratitude - we owe them every
effort to allow them to remain employed and involved in continuing to
protect our nation. Cyber attacks and cyber wars are very much a
constant threat. This way, veterans and retired members of the
intelligence community who already have cyber security backgrounds can
continue their commitment to public service. We need their experience
and expertise in jobs that address the serious cybersecurity threats
now facing our nation. For more on the amendment, click here

Presented Congressional Certificate of Recognition to Chef Johnny
Stewart of McCollum High School
It's no secret that I love the hospitality industry. I grew up in it.
My family owned a restaurant in Alpine from 1917 to 1997.
This week, I
got to honor a person who does a lot for the hospitality industry in
San Antonio - Chef Johnny Stewart of McCollum High School's culinary
arts program. Chef Stewart's passion for cooking and education has made
the McCollum culinary program a phenomenal success.
Chef Stewart is a former coach. However, he always enjoyed cooking. His
wife enrolled him in culinary courses and convinced him to make a
career change. Now, through his skill and dedication, both McCollum and
Harlandale High School students are learning not only culinary skills,
but also entrepreneurial skills involved in running a business in the
hospitality industry.
The hospitality and tourism industries play a major role in San
Antonio's economy and the skills taught by Chef Stewart translate into
real jobs. Congratulations to Chef Stewart for his dedication and
service to the students of Harlandale Independent School District - a
core part of San Antonio's Southside community. For more on his
recognition, click here

Remembering Alex and Maritza Alvarez - and Learning From Them
A few days ago, Field Representative Cynthia Martinez presented a copy
of the Congressional Record to the families of Alex and Maritza Alvarez
and Olga A. Valdez of Eagle Pass. The record contained my statement
honoring their lives.
Alex and Maritza were a young couple from the border region living in
Eagle Pass. They had their whole lives ahead of them. Some two years
ago, they (and Maritza's mother, Olga) were killed by a person who was
texting and driving.
It was a terrible tragedy - and an entirely needless one. In the Texas
House, I joined with former Speaker Tom Craddick (R-Midland) on
legislation outlawing texting and driving. This is a great reminder of
how fragile life really is - and why texting and driving is bad.
As someone who drives a lot - and as a parent who wants to live long
enough to see his son succeed in life - I urge everyone to drive
carefully. No text message is so urgent or impressive that it is worth
a life.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your representative and your
voice in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is indeed a privilege.
If I can help you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of
our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've
never been a big fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part
of the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

June Mobile Office Hours
Our office field representatives continuously meet with constituents
throughout the 23rd District of Texas. Their job is to look for ways
that our office can be helpful to folks on the local level. Our
specialty is dealing with federal agencies and departments.
Growing up in West Texas, I often felt as if the federal government
didn't really take me, my challenges or my opinions seriously. Now that
I'm in Congress, I want to be sure constituents know that I take the
job of addressing their needs seriously. I invite anyone who has an
issue with a federal agency or department to meet with the staff at our
mobile office locations or at any of the district offices. To learn

Remembering
Alex
and
Maritza
Alvarez
-
and
Learning
From
Them
A
few
days
ago,
Field
Representative
Cynthia
Martinez
presented
a
copy
of
the
Congressional
Record
to
the
families
of
Alex
and
Maritza
Alvarez
and
Olga
A.
Valdez
of
Eagle
Pass.
The
record
contained
my
statement
honoring
their
lives.
Alex
and
Maritza
were
a
young
couple
from
the
border
region
living
in
Eagle
Pass.
They
had
their
whole
lives
ahead
of
them.
Some
two
years
ago,
they
(and
Maritza&#8217;s
mother,
Olga)
were
killed
by
a
person
who
was
texting
and
driving.
It
was
a
terrible
tragedy
&#8211;
and
an
entirely
needless
one.
In
the
Texas
House,
I
joined
with
former
Speaker
Tom
Craddick
(R-Midland)
on
legislation
outlawing
texting
and
driving.
This
is
a
great
reminder
of
how
fragile
life
really
is
&#8211;
and
why
texting
and
driving
is
bad.
As
someone
who
drives
a
lot
&#8211;
and
as
a
parent
who
wants
to
live
long
enough
to
see
his
son
succeed
in
life
&#8211;
I
urge
everyone
to
drive
carefully.
No
text
message
is
so
urgent
or
impressive
that
it
is
worth
a
life.
Lastly,
thanks
again
for
letting
me
be
your
representative
and
your
voice
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives.
It
is
indeed
a
privilege.

I
can
help
you

a
federal
agency
or
issue,
please

any
