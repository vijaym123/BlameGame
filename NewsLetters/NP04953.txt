Things just went from
bad to worse:
--
FIRST:
a right-wing Super PAC launched a deceptive ad campaign targeting Cheri.
--
THEN:
Karl Rove piled on with a MASSIVE ad buy of his own.
--
YESTERDAY:
Boehner came to Illinois to rile up the Tea Party base.
Bottom line: the election is exactly SIX days away.
If we don&rsquo;t turn the tide immediately, Cheri&rsquo;s re-election could be done for.
We can get back on track -- and fight the GOP lies -- but only if we hit our final end-of-month goal of the election. If not, we might as well deliver Boehner a win on a silver platter.
David, the choice is yours.
