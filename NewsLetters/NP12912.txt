Lipinski Opposes Giving President Ability to Fast
Track Trade Bills Through
Congress
In the latest edition of the Southwest
News-Herald, Congressman Lipinski writes about his opposition to the
Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, HR 3830, legislation that grants
the President the ability to fast track international trade
agreements through Congress. The Administration is currently negotiating the
Trans Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement between the
United States, Canada, and 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
covering roughly 40 percent of our nations imports and exports. The
congressman strongly believes the Congressional Trade Priorities Act, as well
as the concept of fast tracking any sweeping legislation without input
from the publics elected representatives in Congress, is a terrible
mistake and could hurt middle-class workers. While international trade
agreements have the potential to help create American jobs, we have
seen too many agreements such as NAFTA and the recent Korea Free Trade
Agreement hurt American workers. You can read the congressmans column

Over the last few decades we have
seen American presidents
Democrats and Republicans alike
negotiate
trade agreements that they promised would help American workers. But
these promises of more and better jobs have gone
unfulfilled.
I realize that in our increasingly connected
world, greater foreign trade is necessary to grow the American economy and
create more jobs. But Congress has a responsibility to the American
people to be fully informed about trade agreements the Administration
is negotiating, to take time to carefully study the agreements, and to
make necessary changes to the implementing legislation the
Administration sends to Congress. Only then can we be certain that the interests
of American workers are being served
not just those of American
businesses.
Lipinski Nominates
14 Third District Residents for U.S. Service
Academies
At a
ceremony he hosted at Oak Lawns Johnson-Phelps VFW Post 5220,
Congressman Lipinski presented his 14 nominees from the 3rd Congressional
District for admission to the U.S. Service Academies for the entering
classes of 2014. The event, which includes families of the nominees and
local veterans, is one of the highlights of the year for the congressman.
A nomination from a member of Congress is just the first step in the
rigorous selection process for our countrys elite service academies.
The admissions departments of the service academies will make the
final decision on acceptance. Read more about this years nominees from

One
of my proudest duties as a congressman is helping young men and women
meet their goal of serving our nation by nominating them for admission
to our prestigious service academies. My office receives so many
applications each year from an impressive collection of dedicated,
patriotic students. Just to be nominated to one of our nations service
academies is a major accomplishment and a tremendous honor. I am excited to
see what the future holds for this latest group of nominees. I am
sure each of them will make an impact no matter what path they take in
life.
Congressman Lipinski Named a
Top Bipartisan
Legislator of 2013
Congressman Lipinski introduced more bipartisan pieces of
legislation than any other Democrat in the House of Representatives in
2013, according to an independent analysis by govtrack.us. The website
found that 83 percent of Rep. Lipinskis bills and resolutions last year
had cosponsors from both parties. Among the key bipartisan pieces of
legislation Rep. Lipinski introduced in 2013 were the American
Manufacturing Competitiveness Act (HR 2447), the Buy American Improvement Act
(HR 3346), the Hospital Price Transparency and Disclosure Act (HR
2853), and the Customs Training Enhancement Act (HR 1322). In its 2013
Report Card, govtrack.us noted that the only one other House member
authored more bipartisan pieces of legislation. A complete listing can be

My job as a Representative is not
just to complain and blame, but to propose and work for solutions to
problems that my constituents and our nation face. In this era of bitter
partisanship and divided government, with different parties
representing each chamber of Congress, it is more important than ever to reach
across the aisle and build consensus if we are ever going to get
anything done in Washington. I will continue working with my colleagues
across the political spectrum in 2014 to be a real problem solver for the
American
people.
