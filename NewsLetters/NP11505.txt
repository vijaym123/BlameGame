House passes Tipton water rights bill with bipartisan support: By using
the federal permit, lease, and land management process to extort water
rights from those who hold rights under state law, the federal
government is overreaching, violating private property rights, and the
United States Constitution. The Water Rights Protection Act (H.R.
3189), which would prohibit this practice, is broadly supported by
diverse state, local and national groups including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, American Farm Bureau, and many Colorado counties and
conservation districts. Read more

Things

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single

because
they

You
