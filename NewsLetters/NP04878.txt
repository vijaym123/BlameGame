Friend -- Here&rsquo;s the math:
About a dozen Senate races are up for grabs.
The Republicans need to win just six Democratic seats to take control.
The Senate battle is too close to call, and whichever side fights harder over the next 72 hours will win.
I won&rsquo;t sugarcoat it: time is running out to make sure we win. If we don&rsquo;t give it everything we&rsquo;ve got, Republicans could take control and send us down the wrong path.
The election is in three days.
You have just 72 hours left to prevent a Republican Senate takeover.

But the next 72 hours are absolutely pivotal to the battle for Senate control. I hope you&rsquo;ll understand me asking one more time.
Will you pitch in to stop a Republican Senate takeover before the election in 72 hours?
Thank you,
Barack Obama
