Week in
Review
Another week
of the August district work period is complete, and it was a busy one!
As I continue to visit all corners of the Third District, please be
sure to watch the
calendar on my
website
and
my Facebook page
to
see where Ill be and what events I am hosting in your community
throughout the rest of the district work period. I hope to see
you!
I spent the first
part of this week in Little Rock, where I attended the Arkansas State
Chamber of Commerce's Reverse Fly-in. It was a great opportunity to meet
with job creators and businesses from all over the state of Arkansas.
One of the biggest concerns we discussed was the unfair tax loophole
that allows online-only retailers to play by a different set of rules
than brick-and-mortar businesses across the country and prevents
states from enforcing their existing tax laws and collecting their due
not new
sales tax revenue. I am proud to sponsor the Marketplace
Fairness Act (H.R. 684/S. 743), the commonsense solution that has already
passed the Senate, and I appreciate having support from the members of
the Arkansas State Chamber on this legislative effort! I look forward
to working with my colleagues in the House to get this bill passed and
closing this tax loophole once and for all.
While in Little
Rock on Wednesday morning, I had the chance to join Alice Stewart live
from the 96.5 The Voice studio! Thanks for having me on your
show.
On Thursday, I started
the day with a visit to Washington Junior High School in Bentonville.
My thanks to Bentonville School Superintendent Mike Poore and
Principal Tim Sparacino for showing me around! I was very impressed by your
students. From there, I headed to Bella Vista and Pea Ridge for two town
hall meetings and a round table meeting. Thank you to all those who
came out!
Also on Thursday,
Representative Rick Crawford
(AR-1) ,
Representative Tim Griffin
(AR-2) ,
Representative Tom Cotton (AR-4) , and I
sent a joint letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA)
Secretary Tom Vilsack requesting that the USDA extend the
Commodity Credit Corporation loan repayment date for farmers affected by the
collapse of Turner Grain Merchandising in Brinkley, Arkansas.
You can read the full letter
here .
Next week is the final week of this
district work period. Make sure to check
my
calendar
to see where I will
be!

Policy Update:
Obamacare
Obamacare has increased costs for
families and businesses alike, killed jobs, made full-time employment
harder to find, and limited choice in and access to health care; its
no wonder that its
more unpopular
than ever .
Even President Obama knows Obamacare isnt working
he has
signed into law nine bills which repeal or defund parts of it and has
made unilateral changes or delays to the law 25 times.
In fact,
there have been so many delays and exemptions granted by President
Obama, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently acknowledged that it
can
no longer estimate the
budgetary impact of the law .
But Americans dont need false promises or smoke
and mirror fixes from the President; they need relief from Obamacare.
This relief isnt going to come on its own. Unfortunately,
President Obama is hell-bent on protecting his signature legislation, and
Democrats in the Senate are making it easy for him to do so by failing to
act on literally hundreds of bills the House has passed this
Congress.
59 of these bills specifically provide relief from some of the
most egregious parts of Obamacare, including the individual and
employer mandates, the medical device excise tax, the contraception
mandate, and the 40-hour work week.
Its provisions like these and the laundry list of
promises made about Obamacare that have been broken that continue to
drive the laws growing unpopularity; this comes as no surprise to House
Republicans.
We believe that Americans are empowered when they
are free to make their own decisions about their health care.
That
means they should be able to choose the health care plan they want,
which doctors they see, and the costs they can afford
not the federal
government.
Until
we are able to repeal and replace Obamacare in its entirety, we will
continue to fight for common sense solutions that actually reduce health
care costs and empower patients, states, and employers with better
and more
choices in health care; solutions like strengthening health
savings accounts, selling insurance across state lines, making
medical liability reforms, and equalizing tax treatment for
Americans buying coverage on their own.
Well continue to
work for reforms that protect patients and our
most vulnerable, such as modernizing Medicaid, providing coverage for pre-existing
conditions, and reauthorizing high-risk pools.
And we will
continue to pass legislation that chips away at Obamacare to provide the
American people as much relief from this train-wreck-of-a-law as we
can.
