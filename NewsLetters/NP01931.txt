Forbes Announces 2015 Congressional Art Competition
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) invites all interested high school students to participate in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.
According to a tradition which began in 1982, this annual art competition offers high school students from the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia, and across the country, an opportunity to exhibit their artwork in the United States Capitol.
The Congressional Art Competition reinforces the important role of fine arts curriculum in our schools, and provides an excellent opportunity for budding artists to showcase their talent and the results of their efforts, Forbes said. I am proud of the skill and hard work of our Fourth District students, and look forward to seeing their creativity once again this year.
Every year, each Member of Congress is given the opportunity to choose one piece of art from their Congressional District to display in the Cannon Tunnel, a path tread by many visitors and Members of Congress as they make their way to the U.S. Capitol Building.
The winner from the Fourth District will also be invited to Washington, D.C. to meet Congressman Forbes and attend the annual unveiling ceremony this summer.
Last years winner from Virginias Fourth Congressional District was Sarah Crockett of Midlothian. Her award winning self portrait is pictured here.
Guidelines and information packets are being sent to all high schools in the Fourth Congressional District. Students wishing to participate must submit their artwork no later than Wednesday, April 22, 2015.
All entries must be sent to one of Congressman Forbes district offices in Chesterfield or Chesapeake.
Additional information is available on Congressman Forbes website at

Students may also contact Meggie Trusty in Congressman Forbes Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-6365 for more information.
