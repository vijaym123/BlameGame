Dear Friends,
Mark your calendars for the next
Job Hunters Boot Camp on November 21 at the San Mateo County Event Center ! If you are unemployed, looking for a better job or a career change, this is a MUST ATTEND event. If you know someone who is looking for employment, please
share this email
with him or her.
More than 30 employers with job openings have already signed up to participate and the list is growing every day. If you have attended one of
my past boot camps, you know it&rsquo;s more than a job fair. We not only connect you with employers, we also offer you one-on-one resume review sessions and invaluable job seeker advice in workshops. The six workshops will include topics such as
perfecting your interviewing skills, getting unstuck in your job search, challenges faced by mature workers, new college graduates, and veterans, networking, and best practices on LinkedIn. I promise you that you will feel re-energized in your job search!
This will be my 11th boot camp and I am holding it in conjunction with State Assemblymember Kevin Mullin, who represents California&rsquo;s 22nd District. Room is limited, so we encourage you to register early right
here .
