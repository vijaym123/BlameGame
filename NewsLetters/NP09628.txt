Dear Friend,
Last week, the White
House released the third
U.S.
National Climate Assessment
(NCA). The report was developed over four
years by hundreds of the nations top climate scientists and technical
experts and informed by input from thousands of individuals and
outside organizations gathered through town hall meetings, public-comment
opportunities, and technical workshops across the
country.
As a founding member of the Sustainable Energy &amp; Environmental
Coalition (SEEC),
I am heartened by the
Administrations commitment to addressing climate change
and
seeking out the most comprehensive information to ensure we do so in an
effective way. The NCA is an authoritative and comprehensive missive on
how climate change is affecting America now, and what is to
come.
The main lesson learned is that this is a real issue, with
real consequences and inaction is not an option.
The NCA
not only looked at climate changes impact on the environment, but also
how it affects other areas like health, infrastructure and
agriculture. This is not a political issue; this is a critical generational
responsibility that will take a sustained commitment from Washington and
from each of us at home.
It also broke down the impact at
the local level. According to the report, communities in the Northeast
Region
which include Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and District of Columbia
are affected by heat waves,
more extreme precipitation events, and coastal flooding due to sea level
rise and storm surge. The report cites the significant damage and
risk to infrastructure and buildings in low-lying coastal metropolitan
areas, such as Boston, as well as an impact on the fishing
industry.
The report also discusses initiatives already underway in
Massachusetts to combat the effects of climate change. For example,
according to the report, in recent years renewable energy generation from
wind, solar, and geothermal sources in Massachusetts has increased
more than 50 percent. Since 2009, the Obama Administration has supported
tens of thousands of renewable energy projects throughout the
country, including 3,143 in Massachusetts, generating enough energy to power
more than 45,000 homes.
We must be proactive if we want a sustainable future for the next
generation . Massachusetts has been leading the way in clean energy
and sustainability initiatives, especially here in the Third District
where we are home to several clean energy facilities and innovative
companies that help develop and manufacture clean energy components and
products. In fact, in the past two years, clean energy jobs in
Massachusetts have grown by 24%, and are projected to grow another 11% in 2014.
By supporting these kinds of initiatives now, we can have an impact
on climate change, instead of the other way around.
I look
forward to working with the Administration to address the myriad
issues at play and help preserve the beauty, health and longevity of our
country and our globe.

SSI SAVERS
Last week I introduced the
SSI Savers Act with Congressman Thomas Petri (R-WI) and seven members
of the House of Representatives. This bipartisan legislation will help
low-income seniors and disabled individuals who rely on the
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program gain the financial independence to
eventually transition off of federal assistance.
Current
law requires seniors and the disabled to spend down almost all of their
savings before they can receive SSI support for basic needs such as
food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities, a policy which often
makes them permanently reliant on the federal
government .

MONTACHUSETT EDA GRANT
The Montachusett Regional
Planning Commission was awarded a $70,000 Investment Award Planning
Assistance grant from the Economic Development Administration. The funding
will enable the MRPC to continue to provide economic development and
administrative support to communities in the Montachusett Region that
otherwise would not be available.
Using federal funds
to partner with local communities to create jobs and address public
needs puts us on a solid path to help strengthen our economy. MRPC is a
deserving recipient, who does so much to help strengthen and
revitalize our communities. These federal funds will boost economic
development, in addition to providing more affordable housing options, making
this award an all-around win for the region.
