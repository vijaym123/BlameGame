Supporting Michigan Tourism and Jobs
Dear Friend:
We in Southwest Michigan are fortunate to live in a region where one is only a few short minutes away from our Great Lakes shoreline, one of our innumerable inland lakes and rivers, or miles of scenic trails. We also boast countless museums and cultural centers, wineries and breweries, and partake in annual community festivals year round.
Not surprisingly, the travel and tourism industry plays a major role in our region, bringing roughly a billion dollars to Southwest Michigan every year and supporting thousands of local jobs.
Domestic travelers account for the largest portion of travel spending in the United States, but when you consider that 95 percent of the worlds consumers live overseas, you realize the tremendous potential to further grow our travel and tourism industry.
This week, my House Energy and Commerce Committee approved H.R. 4450, the Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014, to reauthorize Brand USA, which is dedicated to increasing inbound international travel to the United States.
Launched in 2010 under the Travel Promotion Act (TPA), Brand USA is a non-profit, private-public partnership that assists in financing an international advertising campaign for the United States as a travel destination. Unlike other major travel destinations, the United States campaign effort is co-funded by international visitors and contributions from the private sector, not by the taxpayers.
Under Brand USA, a $10 fee is assessed once every two years on visa-free international visitors who enter the United States under the Department of Homeland Securitys Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). This federal contribution is capped at $100 million a year and requires a matching contribution from the U.S. tourism industry.
Under current law, TPA and Brand USA will expire on September 30, 2015. H.R. 4450 seeks to extend these efforts through September 30, 2020.
Extending Brand USAs activities to market the United States as a world travel destination will help our local tourism sector continue to thrive and create jobs.
Thank you for your interest in this important issue. As always, my door is open and I look forward to hearing from you.
God bless,
Fred Upton
