Dear Friend,
As the Christmas season winds down and Missourians get ready to welcome
2014, the reality of the President's health care law is beginning to
hit home for so many of us who have been forced to give up the health
plans we liked and wanted to keep. (Yes, I had to get a new plan, too,
on the exchange...at a 68% increase in cost!)
Many of the new health
plans we have had to enroll in are more expensive than the plans we had
to abandon and require us to pay for coverage we don't need and
certainly don't want.
But that's not the only reason to be concerned about the new healthcare
law.
There's a chance many people who thought they had enrolled in
various health care plans are not actually enrolled, after all. Many
Americans who signed up through the government exchanges have been
incorrectly informed they enrolled in plans. If you're in this category
you might be in for a big shock early in the new year when you learn
that while you were informed you had enrolled, the insurance company
you thought you had signed up with might know nothing about you. Bottom
line - you might not have coverage!
We also have recently learned that many of the navigators who are
supposed to be guiding consumers wanting to enroll in plans have made a
series of mistakes. These mistakes include giving enrollees incorrect
information and failing to properly secure enrollees' personal health
information, Social Security numbers, and annual incomes. We have also
been told that some of these navigators have encouraged consumers to
commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for
Obamacare's health insurance subsidies.
This is yet another example of an unworkable law that should never have
been launched before it was ready. As we begin the new year, I remain
committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to end this
disastrous law and to replace it with health care options that offer
all Americans access to quality, affordable health coverage they want.
On another matter, I am pleased to share that even though Congress was
not in session, negotiators from the House and Senate Agriculture
Committees were at work hammering out the final details of what I hope
will be a comprehensive five-year Farm Bill. There are still
differences between the House and Senate versions of the Farm Bill, but
the principle negotiators are making significant progress and the
conferees plan to vote the first full week back in January. As a member
of the House Agriculture Committee, I am committed to serving the
interests of both consumers and farmers - approving a Farm Bill that
provides the United States with a safe, plentiful, and affordable
supply of food for many years to come. I hope to be able to share some
good news with early in the new year.
>From my family to yours, have a blessed and prosperous New Year!
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
As
the
Christmas
season
winds
down
and
Missourians
get
ready
to
welcome
2014,
the
reality
of
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law
is
beginning
to
hit
home
for
so
many
of
us
who
have
been
forced
to
give
up
the
health
plans
we
liked
and
wanted
to
keep.
(Yes,
I
had
to
get
a
new
plan,
too,
on
the
exchange...at
a
68%
increase
in
cost!)
Many
of
the
new
health
plans
we
have
had
to
enroll
in
are
more
expensive
than
the
plans
we
had
to
abandon
and
require
us
to
pay
for
coverage
we
don&#8217;t
need
and
certainly
don&#8217;t
want.
But
that's
not
the
only
reason
to
be
concerned
about
the
new
healthcare
law.
There&#8217;s
a
chance
many people
who
thought they
had
enrolled
in
various
health
care
plans
are
not
actually
enrolled,
after
all.
Many
Americans
who
signed
up
through
the
government
exchanges
have
been
incorrectly
informed
they
enrolled
in
plans.
If
you&#8217;re
in
this
category
you
might
be
in
for
a
big
shock
early
in
the
new
year
when
you
learn
that
while
you
were
informed
you
had
enrolled,
the
insurance
company
you
thought
you
had
signed
up
with
might
know
nothing
about
you.
Bottom
line
&#8211;
you
might
not
have
coverage!
We
also
have
recently
learned
that
many
of
the
navigators
who
are
supposed
to
be
guiding
consumers
wanting
to
enroll
in
plans
have
made
a
series
of
mistakes.
These
mistakes
include
giving
enrollees
incorrect
information
and
failing
to
properly
secure
enrollees&#8217;
personal
health
information,
Social
Security
numbers,
and
annual
incomes.
We
have
also
been
told
that
some
of
these
navigators
have
encouraged
consumers
to
commit
tax
fraud
by
underreporting
income
in
order
to
qualify
for
Obamacare&#8217;s
health
insurance
subsidies.
This
is
yet
another
example
of
an
unworkable
law
that
should
never
have
been
launched
before
it
was
ready.
As
we
begin
the
new

I
remain
committed
to
working
with
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
end
this
disastrous
law
and
to
replace
it
with
health
care
options
that
offer
all
Americans
access
to
quality,
affordable
health
coverage
they
want.
On
another
matter,
I
am
pleased
to
share
that
even
though
Congress
was
not
in

negotiators
from
the
House
and
Senate
Agriculture
Committees
were
at
work
hammering

the
final
details
of
what
I
hope
will
be
a
comprehensive
five-year
Farm

There
are
still

between
the
House
and
Senate
versions
of
the
Farm

but
the
principle
negotiators
