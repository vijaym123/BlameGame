Serrano Joins Democrats in Demanding Extension of Unemployment
Insurance
On Wednesday, December 11 th , Congressman Serrano,
along with 173 of his Democratic colleagues sent a letter to Speaker
John Boehner urging him allow a vote on an extension of the Emergency
Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program. The program will expire on
December 28, 2013. As a result of the programs expiration, 1.3 million
jobless workers will have their benefits cut and another 1.9
million will exhaust their limited state unemployment benefits and will no
longer be eligible for EUC benefits in 2014. Unfortunately, the
Speaker did not allow a vote on the extension of EUC and Republicans sent
Congress home without addressing this issue.
