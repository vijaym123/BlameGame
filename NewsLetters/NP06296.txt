House Passes Walberg Bill to Increase
Accountability in Government
Weekly Update
The House passed my bill, H.R. 5169, the Senior Executive Service Accountability Act, to provide greater transparency and accountability within the Senior Executive Service by making it easier to discipline and fire these senior level executives for misconduct
Voted in favor of H.R. 2, the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act, and H.R. 4, the Jobs for America Act. These bills would expand energy production, lower energy costs at home, reduce federal regulations, lower taxes and equip job-creators with the tools they need to succeed
Helped pass multiple pieces of legislation to assist our veterans by reining in out-of-control costs of major Veterans Affairs projects, providing a cost-of-living increase for certain disabled veterans and their dependents, and extending a number of important programs for female and homeless veterans
Voted for a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program
Chaired a Subcommittee on Workforce Protections hearing on legislation
to bring increased transparency and accountability to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Awarded Dick and Cathy Caskey from North Adams with the 2014
Angels in Adoption
award through the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute
