Farm Bill Passes House, Army Major Guest at State of the Union
Dear Friend,
A busy week in Washington. After over two years of wrangling, the House
passed a farm bill.
The Congress and the nation also heard the
President lay out his plan for a year of action. Here's a quick wrap up
of the week.
Farm Bill Passes
The House passed the 2014 farm bill by a vote of 251 to 166.
The
language was a compromise between House and Senate negotiators.
It was
a painful and arduous process for the agriculture community, but a
critical bill for the nation.
One of the more controversial components
is a cut of $8.6 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP). However, the House-passed version contained a $40 billion cut.
Thus, the final version maintained SNAP for about 4 million people.
Other parts of the bill deal with diverse issues from insurance for
farmers and ranchers to research and education to food stamps and
school lunches and assistance for rural communities across America.
The bill also reforms, consolidates or eliminates some current programs
which saves billions of taxpayer dollars over the next 10 years.
State of the Union
On Tuesday night, I heard the President's State of the Union address.
The President spoke of increasing economic opportunity for the
unemployed, improving our schools, and supporting both our active duty
military and veterans - all of these things are critical for our
future.
It was a call to action,
but both Democrats and Republicans
must understand that action requires more public service and less
partisan politics. Division seems more rampant than at any other point
in recent history. To move the ball down the field, we all have to play
together for the same team:
Team USA.
Army Major Guest at State of the Union
Many members of Congress invite a guest to the State of the Union.
To
underscore my commitment and thanks to those who serve, my guest was a
member of the Armed Services, Army Major Nekita D. Hunter of San
Antonio. Major Hunter is an Army nurse who has served for 21 years in
the U.S. Army, including service in Iraq at the height of the Iraqi
conflict.
She also has a connection to West Texas, having graduated
from Lamesa High School.
In West Texas terms, Lamesa isn't very far
from my own hometown of Alpine.
San Antonio Toyota Plant Turns 10
Earlier in the week, I took time to visit the Washington, D.C. Auto
Show and to record a message for Toyota employees in San Antonio. I
kicked the tires on the San Antonio-built Toyota Tundra and Tacoma
trucks. My dad used to kick the tires on each car he was inspecting -
so I did the same thing.
Toyota and its local suppliers employ 5,700
Texans in the San Antonio region.
The
company has also invested over
$2.2 billion in San Antonio.
The plant recently turned 10 and rolled
out its millionth truck (they make over 900 a day).
Joe DaRosa, who
was recently named plant president, comes to San Antonio via
California.
I'm sure he will like Texas much better.
Thank you,
Toyota, for creating opportunities for so many folks in Texas.
Loop 79 Breaks Ground, Meeting with Del Rio's Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce and Lions Club
On Thursday, I attended the groundbreaking of Loop 79 expansion in Val
Verde County. The loop will help traffic congestion through Del Rio and
speed trade and commerce. I had the chance to work on the project while
in the State Legislature.
I also visited with members of the local
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce while in Del Rio.
My successor in the
Legislature, State Representative Poncho Nevarez (D-Eagle Pass) was
present for both events.
Witty and always sharply dressed, Rep.
Nevarez is earning high marks for his service.
I've never been a big fan of politics, so doing things that help people
is my favorite part of the job.
If I can help you with a federal
agency or issue, please call on any of our offices. The phone numbers
and addresses are listed below.
Please put us to work.
As always, many thanks for letting me be your congressman.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

House, Army

Dear
Friend,
A
busy
week
in
Washington.
After
over
two
years
of
wrangling,
the
House
passed
a
farm
bill.
The
Congress
and
the
nation
also
heard
the
President
lay
out
his
plan
for
a
year
of
action.
Here&#8217;s
a
quick
wrap
up
of
the
week.
Farm
Bill
Passes
The
House
passed
the
2014
farm
bill
by
a
vote
of
251
to
166.
The
language
was
a
compromise
between
House
and
Senate
negotiators.
It
was
a
painful
and
arduous
process
for
the
agriculture
community,
but
a
critical
bill
for
the
nation.
One
of
the
more
controversial
components
is
a
cut
of
$8.6
billion
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(SNAP).
However,
the
House-passed
version
contained
a
$40
billion
cut.
Thus,
the
final
version
maintained
SNAP
for
about
4
million
people.
Other
parts
of
the
bill
deal
with
diverse
issues
from
insurance
for
farmers
and
ranchers
to
research
and
education
to
food

and
assistance
for
rural
communities
across
America.
The
bill
also
reforms,
consolidates
or
eliminates
some
current
programs
which
saves
billions
of
taxpayer
dollars
over
the
next
10
years.
State
of
the
Union
On
Tuesday
night,
I
heard
the
President&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
address.
The
President
spoke
of
increasing
economic
opportunity
for
the
unemployed,
improving
our
schools,
and
supporting
both
our
active
duty
military
and
veterans
-
all
of
these
things
are
critical
for
our
future.
It
was
a
call
to
action,
but
both
Democrats
and
Republicans
must
understand
that
action
requires
more
public
service
and
less
partisan
politics.
Division
seems
more
rampant
than
at
any
other
point
in
recent
history.
To
move
the
ball
down
the
field,
we
all
have
to
play
together
for
the
same
team:
Team
USA.
Army
Major
Guest
at
State
of
the
Union
Many
members
of
Congress
invite
a
guest
to
the
State
of
the
Union.
To
underscore
my
commitment
and
thanks
to
those
who
serve,
my
guest
was
a
member
of
the
Armed
Services,
Army
Major
Nekita
D.
Hunter
of
San
Antonio.
Major
Hunter
is
an
Army
nurse
who
has
served
for
21
years
in
the
U.S.
Army,
including
service
in
Iraq
at
the
height
of
the
Iraqi
conflict.
She
also
has
a
connection
to
West
Texas,
having
graduated
from
Lamesa
High
School.
In
West
Texas
terms,
Lamesa
isn't
very
far
from
my
own
hometown
of
Alpine.

Thank

for
creating
opportunities
for
so
many
folks
in
Texas.
