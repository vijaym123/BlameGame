Dear Friend,
On Monday, President Obama didn&#146;t have a strategy to train Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. In fact, at a press conference in Germany he made it clear that the he had &#147;no complete plan.&#148; That&#146;s almost exactly the same thing he said ten months ago, when he admitted &#147;we don&#146;t have a strategy yet.&#148; Just two days after this week&#146;s admission, the president suddenly authorized up to 450 more troops to be sent to Iraq to advise Iraqi forces. Americans deserve better than knee&#45;jerk foreign policy.
President Obama has not taken ISIS seriously from the beginning, famously calling them the &#147;J.V. team&#148; last September. ISIS is making gains in the Middle East, but disappointingly nothing has materialized from this president except excuses and procrastination. Despite repeated pushes for a concrete plan to deal with terrorists who wish Americans harm, the president has instead focused on negotiating a potentially disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. Instead of eliminating threats, he&#146;s creating risks.
Each day he waits to solidify a plan, more Christians are captured and enslaved or beheaded, and more land is overtaken by terrorists who are committed to killing innocent Americans. The president needs to define what a victory against ISIS would entail and to explain his comprehensive plan to keep this evil from coming to our shores. Homeland security doesn&#146;t begin at our border, and the American people deserve a leader in their commander in chief. The stakes are just too high to waiver on America&#146;s security. The U.S. can&#146;t lead from behind.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
