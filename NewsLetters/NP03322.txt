28th
District
Dear
Friends,
This past week has been a whirlwind.
Last Thursday, I was
selected to be the Ranking Member, or top Democrat, of the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the committee in charge
of overseeing all activities of our nations intelligence community
and agencies. If Democrats were in the majority, that would make me the
Chairman of the committee.
I feel honored, to say the
least, and Im deeply grateful for the trust placed in me by the
Democratic Caucus and Leader Nancy Pelosi. The Committee has one of the
most important and difficult tasks in the Congress
keeping our
country safe and overseeing the many agencies within the Intelligence
Community.
As the tragic events of the last week make clear, the
work of our intelligence agencies and our relationships with allies
will continue to be of unsurpassed importance in protecting our nation
and values.
This means that I will serve as part of
the Gang of Eight, which refers to the four top members of the House
and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate President,
Senate Minority Leader, House Speaker and House Minority Leader. By law,
the President must keep the Gang of Eight informed of our countrys
most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight. Its a
big responsibility.
There will be no shortage of issues to
come before the Committee in this session, from addressing new
threats of terrorism at home and around the world, to reforming our
surveillance capabilities and oversight, securing and reinforcing our nations
cybersecurity, and maintaining the privacy rights of law-abiding
Americans.
But even as I
take on this these added responsibilities, I am determined to be as
tenacious as ever in pursuing the priorities and policies of importance
to
our community
from improving our economy and helping to
create new, and good-paying jobs, to passing comprehensive immigration
reform, and repairing our nations crumbling infrastructure. It also means
I will continue pushing for increased parkland and open space, a
strong space program, more mass transit, relief from excessive
helicopter noise, better forest fire protection, an earthquake early warning
system, and many, many other matters of importance to you and your
neighbors.
So I hope you will share with me any
thoughts you may have on intelligence, national security and privacy matters,
and continue to keep me abreast of other local and national issues
you wish me to pursue. I really value your input and can't do my job
well without it. You can also always share your thoughts through
Facebook
or
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Congressman Adam Schiff
