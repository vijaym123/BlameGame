Dear Friend,
This week, President Obama delivered the annual State of the Union
Address. The State of the Union is an opportunity for the President to
set the tone for the year ahead. This address sets the tone for how he
is going to interact with Congress and what we can accomplish together
as a nation.
I believe the number one priority has to be focused on job creation and
growing our economy. This can't be done by President Obama taking
unilateral action with executive orders and circumventing Congress'
role in the governing process. It has to be done by creating an
environment for businesses to thrive. While the campaign style rhetoric
of blaming Congress has been a go to message for President Obama, the
results have always led to partisan gridlock.
My hope is that this year will be a 'year of action' that will show
progress on the most important issues facing our country which includes
reducing our national debt, developing solutions to fixing the problems
with ObamaCare, providing an environment for economic growth, and
finding ways to work together on legislation that will help put people
back to work.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
President
Obama
delivered
the
annual
State
of
the
Union
Address.
The
State
of
the
Union
is
an
opportunity
for
the
President
to
set
the
tone
for
the
year
ahead.
This
address
sets
the
tone
for
how
he
is
going
to
interact
with
Congress
and
what
we
can
accomplish
together
as
a
nation.
I
believe
the
number
one
priority
has
to
be
focused
on
job
creation
and
growing
our
economy.
This
can&#8217;t
be
done
by
President
Obama
taking
unilateral
action
with
executive
orders
and
circumventing
Congress&#8217;
role
in
the
governing
process.
It
has
to
be
done
by
creating
an
environment
for
businesses
to
thrive.
While
the
campaign
style
rhetoric
of
blaming
Congress
has
been
a
go
to
message
for
President
Obama,
the
results
have
always
led
to
partisan
gridlock.
My
hope
is
that
this
year
will
be
a
&#8216;year
of
action&#8217;
that
will
show
progress
on
the
most
important
issues
facing
our
country
which
includes
reducing
our
national
debt,
developing
solutions
to
fixing
the
problems
with
ObamaCare,
providing
an
environment
for
economic
growth,
and
finding
ways
to
work
together
on
legislation
that
will
help
put
people
back
to
work.
Sincerely,
Kay
Granger
