Stop Executive Overreach:
From unilaterally changing the Affordable Care Act, to suspending parts of our immigration laws, to ignoring statutory mandatory minimum laws in narcotics cases, the President's actions threaten to usurp our system of co-equal branches of government. We have pursued certain remedies afforded to Congress to address executive overreach but these efforts have been thwarted.
On Tuesday of this week, we introduced a
bill
to give Congress the authority to defend this branch of government as the Framers and our fellow citizens would expect. Read more about this bill

IRS Targeting:
On Wednesday, Lois Lerner appeared before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to testify about the IRS targeting scandal. Although she made 17 factual statements in her initial appearance before the Committee in May of 2013, Ms. Lerner again chose to invoke her 5th Amendment privilege to not testify.
