Dear Friend &ndash;
The holiday season is fully underway and I for one find myself thinking about all those healthy resolutions I&rsquo;ll make&hellip;next year.
But there is something that simply cannot wait: signing up for quality, affordable health insurance through Covered California.
If you want coverage beginning January 1, 2015, you have to enroll by December 15, 2014.
If you already have coverage,
it&rsquo;s time to come back and renew it
unless you have Medi-cal, which will contact you about next steps.
If you don&rsquo;t have coverage, visit CoveredCA.com, call (800) 300-1506, or
find in-person local
help to learn about the plans in your area, to see what financial assistance is available and get covered.
For every family member enrolling for health insurance, you will need:
Proof of current income
CA ID or driver&rsquo;s license of the person who is applying for the family
US passport, legal resident card or certificate of citizenship or naturalization documentation
Birthdates
Social Security Numbers
Home Zip Code
If you have any questions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact my District Office at (714) 621-0102 or visit my website at lorettasanchez.house.gov/EnrollOC.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
