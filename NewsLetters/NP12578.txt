The State of the Union
Last week, at the State of the Union, President Obama put attention
right where it should be: on efforts to help the middle class and those
hoping to enter it. Our economy and our families will never reach their
full potential if growth only comes from the top down, and not from the
middle out. What our country needs most is a middle class agenda that
prioritizes good jobs now and expanded opportunity for the next
generation. Click here

A good start is making sure that the minimum wage is a living wage.
Last year, Senator Merkley sent a letter to the President asking him to
raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for federal contract workers.
President Obama answered that call last week and announced during the
State of the Union that he would sign an executive order raising the
minimum wage for the hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers
making the minimum wage. Now Congress must act to raise the minimum
wage for all workers, because no one should have to raise a family in
poverty. Jeff cosponsored a bill that would do just that, raising the
minimum wage to $10.10 for all workers.
Lilly Ledbetter Anniversary
Last week was the fifth anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
being signed into law. One of his first acts when Jeff entered the
Senate was voting for this important law to make sure women aren't the
victims of pay discrimination. The Lilly Ledbetter Act is proof that
even one person fighting for fairness and equality can make a huge
difference. But it's also a reminder of how far we have to go to make
sure that women have equal opportunity and equal pay in the workplace.
Women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is
just plain wrong. It's unfair, unequal, and it cuts into millions of
families' bottom lines. Too often, our legal system still doesn't work
for women who try to find justice in the courts. Thanks to Lilly, they
no longer face unfair statutes of limitations that require them to seek
justice before they might even know they face pay discrimination. But
there is more work to be done. That is why Jeff is fighting to give
women stronger tools to fight wage discrimination by passing the
Paycheck Fairness Act.
Unemployment Insurance
It is unconscionable and callous that Congress has allowed emergency
unemployment benefits to expire. On December 28, over 20,000 Oregonians
lost their benefits that were helping pay for their housing, their
food, and their utilities as they looked for work. The unemployment
rate is just too high to let this important lifeline expire for
thousands of Oregonians. Jeff has pushed for Congress to reauthorize
unemployment insurance, and will continue to advocate for those looking
to work. We can't leave these Oregonians out in the cold.
Organics
The farm bill that recently passed the House of Representatives
includes Jeff's amendment to level the playing field for organic
farmers when it comes to crop insurance. This provision will direct the
Risk Management Agency of USDA to use actual organic prices to
calculate compensation for losses in order to better reflect an organic
producer's risk. Up until this month, organic farmers in Oregon who had
crop insurance were paying a 5 percent premium for their crop
insurance, but then not receiving higher benefits if their crops were
affected by weather or other unforeseen problems. You can read more

It's

Too
