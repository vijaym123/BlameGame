WOW David!!! We wanted to have a big start for Cheri in 2015, but you
blew us away. So far this year, we&rsquo;ve raised over $25,000 online!!! That&rsquo;s amazing! Especially considering our average gift is from over contributions!!! But our campaign is about so much more than money in the door. It&rsquo;s about fighting for the issues you care about most.
David Johnson Will you sign your name to say you&rsquo;re in for Cheri in 2015?
Sign your name &gt;&gt;
Thanks for all that you do!!!!! -Team Bustos
