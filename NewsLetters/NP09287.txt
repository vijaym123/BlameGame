Statement on the Resignation of
VA Secretary Eric Shinseki
5/30/14
I am pleased
that Eric Shinseki has made the right decision and resigned as VA
Secretary. However, we must remember that there is still a lot of work to
do to get to the bottom of the horrendous behavior that has been
uncovered at VA facilities across the country. While accountability starts
at the top, anyone at any level who knew of these waiting lists must
be fired immediately. Our job is not over
we must fix the VA system.
Today, I joined colleagues in Colorado and Wyoming in introducing
legislation to make sure that bonuses are not paid out to senior VA
leadership until wait time backlogs have been eliminated. These and other
like-minded efforts must continue if we are going to once-and-for-all
fix our veterans health care system and provide a service that honors
their sacrifice.
