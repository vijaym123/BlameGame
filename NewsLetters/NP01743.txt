Its true there is a myriad of complex issues facing our nation, but there are also common sense action steps Congress can take right now, which shouldnt be that difficult to agree on. Here are three things Washington needs to do to light up the economy and better support small businesses:
1)
Streamline and cut back on unnecessary and overly burdensome regulations.
2)
Create a tax system that is more fair, less complex, and allows American companies to stay competitive.
3)
Get out of the way. Allow entrepreneurs the freedom to innovate, grow their businesses, and create jobs.
Im working to
reintroduce
sanity and accountability to the regulation process,
require
federal agencies to consider the impact their rules will have on small business growth and job creation, and
create
a simpler, fairer tax code.
Yours in service,
Randy
