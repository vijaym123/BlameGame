The Rigell Report: Did You Hear That?
**A message from Scotts Communications Director, Kim Mosser Knapp**
Dear Friend,
Did you hear that?
Thats the sound of Congress ending on a high note and finishing a legislative session without a crisis on Christmas Eve.
For all of Washingtons dysfunction, partisanship, and gridlock,
Congress is poised to pass a budget
for the first time since 2009.
Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed an agreement crafted by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (a Republican) and Senate Budget Chairwoman Patty Murray (a Democrat).
The plan alleviates some of the pain caused by sequestration; provides budget certainty for our military and small businesses; reduces the deficit; and eliminates the potential for another government shutdown
all without raising taxes.
But lets be clear: no one is claiming mission accomplished here.
There is significant work to be done before this country is in the financial safe zone.
Scott is committed to working toward passing a balanced budget that eliminates our crushing $17 trillion debt.
It cant be done overnight, but substantive, incremental steps are important. This deal represents one of those steps.
About your government:
In addition to funding the government and crafting laws, Congress plays an important role in providing oversight of federal agencies, ensuring that tax dollars are spent wisely and that our government officials act appropriately.
This year, House Republicans have been focused on uncovering the truth about the tragedy in Benghazi, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and the IRS scandal.
