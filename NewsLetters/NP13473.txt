A Merry Christmas to All
Throughout the
course of history, the Christmas season seems to bring people together,
even during times of war.
For instance, in 1914, British and
German troops stopped fighting during World War I while they decorated
their barracks and sang Silent Night in English, French, and
German.
Later, in World War II, battle was suspended on many fronts
to tune intoopera star Ernestine Schumann-Heink singing Stille
Nacht.
She had one son fighting for the Axis and one son fighting
for the Allies.
Additionally, history notes that many of
the Christmas traditions that we observe today became widespread during
the Civil War. Christmas trees were a part of the culture before the
war, but it was during the Civil War that decorating them became
popular.
Christmas boxes or gifts were sent to both sides from
home.
These boxes held homemade goodies or even clothing to
protect soldiers from the cold.
Christmas carols were sung,
reminding the carolers of loved ones who were far away from home.
Those
carols are similar to the ones being sung across America this week and
even overseas.
Once again American men and women are
fighting overseas during Christmas.
Now, like then, they are
fighting to make the world safer from tyranny.
Whether they are in
Afghanistan or Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany, all are serving their
country proudly.
On this Christmas, I ask for everyone to
come together and say a prayer for those Americans serving overseas
and away from their families.
I also want to thank them for their
brave service.
And I wish everyone a very Merry
Christmas!
