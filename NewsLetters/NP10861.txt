Sixth District Report
Dear Friend
This week, not only did I pass my second piece of legislation out of
the House, but we watched as the Cats took out Michigan and now
Wisconsin! Congratulations to Coach Cal and the Cats on an unbelievable
season! Number nine, here we come! GO CATS!
And while we celebrate the victories of the week, Carol and I are still
thinking of those affected by the tragedy at Fort Hood. Our thoughts
and prayers are with the victims, families and the entire Fort Hood
community.
Passing Commonsense Solutions to Protect Jobs and the Valley View Ferry
The American people elect Representatives to go to Washington and
advocate on their behalf. They rightly expect us to do all we can to
work together to solve problems impacting their daily lives.
So when local officials shared that the Valley View Ferry was unable to
hire captains due to one-size-fits-all federal regulations that did not
serve the ferry's unique operation, we needed a commonsense, practical
solution.
That's why last year, I introduced the Valley View Ferry Preservation
Act and worked with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to
include it in the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014.
This week, the House came together and advanced my solution so we can
end the threat of economic disruption and hardship for the merchants
and workers who rely on the Valley View Ferry.
It is my hope that the House will continue working together in this
fashion to promote real solutions that will directly help create a
better environment for job-creation and restore America's faith in our
ability to work together to get the job done.
The Save American Workers Act
Unfortunately, we all know people who are currently looking for
employment and who are unable to care for their families as they would
like.
On top of the insurance cancellation notices, higher premiums, and
reduced hours Americans are seeing as a result of Obamacare, the law is
forcing job creators to cut employees' hours in order to comply, and
hindering them from creating new jobs.
Thanks to Obamacare, millions of already-struggling Americans are
having an even harder time finding work, caring for their families, and
putting food on their tables because Obamacare is putting full-time
work and decent wages out of reach.
I speak with small business owners all across central and eastern
Kentucky, and they want to put people back to work. They want to invest
and grow their business. They want to be able to provide healthcare to
their employees.
That is why I am glad to be a cosponsor of Congressman Todd Young's
legislation, the Save American Workers Act, which the House passed on
Thursday. This legislation would simply repeal the 30-hour definition
of "full-time employment" in the Affordable Care Act, and restore the
traditional 40-hour definition. This proposal helps employees who are
seeing their hours cut and lowers the tax burden and regulatory cost on
our nation's small businesses. And according to the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office, it would also create $75 billion in higher
cash wages for American workers.
At a time when Americans are struggling, we must do everything we can
to invest in real solutions like the Save American Workers Act of 2014
that would grow the economy and get the country working again.

Kentuckians in the Capitol
I had an informative discussion about the human rights concerns in
Tibet with some of my Tibetan-American constituents.
Thanks to Sarah Spaulding, a member of the American Society of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Graduate Research Assistant &
PhD Candidate at the Markey Cancer Center for meeting with me to
discuss the importance of biomedical research and even talk a little
basketball!
It was great to see Girl Scout Troop 749 while they were in Washington
and stopped by to take a tour of the U.S. Capitol!
On Wednesday, I met with Terry Bunn, the Director of Kentucky's Injury
Prevention and Research Center to discuss the important research that
is being done in Kentucky, and how this data is being used to help
prevent injuries in our commonwealth.
I was glad to see my old soccer coach, Mr. Fister, and Mitch Long, both
of GRW Aerial Surveys in Lexington, to discuss their company's
innovative mapping, surveying, and aerial photography services and the
need for the federal government to facilitate an open, competitive
marketplace.
I enjoyed meeting Bill Strong, his wife Judi, and their grandson
Brayden while they were visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday. It sounds
like they had a busy trip to DC, and I enjoyed sharing some of my
favorite sights.
Congratulations to James Keene of George Rogers Clark High School in
Winchester on being named Assistant Principal of the Year for Kentucky.
I enjoyed visiting with John Higginbotham and learning about the good
work of the Frankfort Plant Board.
I had a great visit with members of the Kentucky Rental Association, in
town to discuss how equipment rental businesses are impacted by certain
tax rules.
I was glad to have the opportunity to meet the Washnock family from
Independence and Lexington before their tour of the U.S. Capitol.

Sexual Assault Awareness Month
April is National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, where
we have an opportunity to recommit ourselves to raising awareness and
promoting the prevention of sexual violence.
As a husband, father, uncle, and brother, stopping sexual violence is
of utmost importance to me.
Last year the crisis of sexual assault in the military was brought to
my attention in a much more personal and meaningful way when a
constituent survivor came to my office to tell me her story. What this
constituent, a veteran of our armed services, shared with me was not
just that she had been a victim of unwanted sexual conduct during her
active duty service in the 1990's, but also that she had struggled in
the years since leaving the military unable to access the services that
she need to treat and overcome the trauma she had suffered.
Unfortunately, these constituents and their concerns are far from
uncommon. According to the Pentagon, an unprecedented 26,000 military
personnel were sexually assaulted in 2012. While there is clearly much
to be done to address the prevention of these assaults, there is an
immediate need to change the system so we can help military sexual
trauma (MST) survivors who are trying to get the care they need.
This is why I authored and introduced H.R. 3775, the Military Sexual
Assault Victims Empowerment Act, also known as the Military SAVE Act
, which would empower survivors of
military sexual trauma to select their own care providers and provide
the support these brave service members have earned.
At the end of the day, these survivors fought and sacrificed for their
country and we must honor the commitment that this country has made to
them. I am honored to stand with survivors and their families and look
forward to working with my cosponsors and colleagues on the House
Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus to continue advancing this
legislation so we can give these heroes the best healthcare they need,
the best healthcare they deserve, and the best healthcare that they
have earned.
I am grateful for the wide, bipartisan support this legislation has
received
.
Please join me and stand with survivors and their families by signing
up as a Citizen Cosponsor
of my legislation, the Military Sexual Assault Victim
Empowerment Act, also known as the Military SAVE Act, by clicking here

Around the District
I met with the employees of Bowie Refined Coal in Irvine on Monday. It
was great to great to see new coal jobs created in Estill County.
I spent a great afternoon on the Eastern Kentucky University campus
with Student Government Director of Government Relations Michael Poe at
the EKU Student Government-sponsored Coffee with the Congressman.
Students from a variety of majors joined me in discussing the role of a
Congressman as well as an interesting question and answer period that
featured questions ranging from student loan payments and immigration
to diversity in education and agriculture.
I concluded the day with my second of three lectures teaching in
conjunction with President Michael Benson.
Casework Corner: Ensuring Veterans Receive the Honors They Earned
I am constantly grateful for the service of our uniformed men and
women. On Monday, I was humbled to recognize one of those men in Estill
County, Darrell Calmes. Darrell valiantly served our country in
Vietnam, entering the war at the age of 19. Previously, Darrell was
awarded medals, but they were destroyed in a house fire. My office was
able to obtain his service medals after reaching out to the National
Personnel Records Center and working with them to identify and attain
these awards. I was honored to be a small part of recognizing his
heroism.
If you are facing troubles with obtaining service medals, please don't
hesitate to contact my office. As a Member of Congress, it is an honor
to assist our veterans by acknowledging their brave acts of valor.
Getting Serious About Reducing Spending
For far too long, Washington has failed to take its spending problem
and its budgetary responsibilities seriously.
At a time when Kentucky families are struggling to stretch every dime,
I am committed to reducing federal spending, setting priorities that
honor hard-working taxpayers, protecting central and eastern Kentucky
interests, and promoting economic growth that will create jobs.
Every hardworking taxpayer in America knows that they have to have a
budget and that you can't continue to spend money that you don't have.
That's why I supported the No Budget, No Pay Act, which said simply
that Members of Congress should not get paid if they fail to fulfill
the most basic responsibility of governing: passing a budget. The No
Budget, No Pay Act was the first step in an effort to bring real fiscal
responsibility to Washington.
The current debt limit law is a failure that does nothing to actually
limit spending or remove the threat of default. It is time to stop
allowing politicians to spend money today only to worry about how to
pay for it tomorrow.
That's why I also introduced legislation, H.R. 4021, the Debt Limit
Reform and Congressional Pay for Performance Act of 2014, to change the
way Washington works by advancing a new, much-needed solution that will
that would create a new formula for establishing the debt ceiling based
on the size of the economy and a declining schedule of spending
targets. To make sure Congress is committed to making the tough
decisions, each Member of Congress' compensation would be tied to their
ability to meet a yearly fiscal sustainability target.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.

home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

Dear
Friend
This
week,
not
only
did
I
pass
my
second
piece
of
legislation
out
of
the
House,
but
we
watched
as
the
Cats
took
out
Michigan
and
now
Wisconsin!
Congratulations
to
Coach
Cal
and
the
Cats
on
an
unbelievable
season!
Number
nine,
here
we
come!
GO
CATS!
And
while
we
celebrate
the
victories
of
the
week,
Carol
and
I
are
still
thinking
of
those
affected
by
the
tragedy
at
Fort
Hood.
Our
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
victims,
families
and
the
entire
Fort
Hood
community.
Passing
Commonsense
Solutions
to
Protect
Jobs
and
the
Valley
View
Ferry
The
American
people
elect
Representatives
to
go
to
Washington
and
advocate
on
their
behalf.
They
rightly
expect
us
to
do
all
we
can
to
work
together
to
solve
problems
impacting
their
daily
lives.
So
when
local
officials
shared
that
the
Valley
View
Ferry
was
unable
to
hire
captains
due
to
one-size-fits-all
federal
regulations
that
did
not
serve
the
ferry&#8217;s
unique
operation,
we
needed
a
commonsense,
practical
solution.
That&#8217;s
why
last
year,
I
introduced
the
Valley
View
Ferry
Preservation
Act
and
worked
with
the
Transportation
and
Infrastructure
Committee
to
include
it
in
the
Coast
Guard
and
Maritime
Transportation
Act
of
2014.
This
week,
the
House
came
together
and
advanced
my
solution
so
we
can
end
the
threat
of
economic
disruption
and
hardship
for
the
merchants
and
workers
who
rely
on
the
Valley
View
Ferry.
It
is
my
hope
that
the
House
will
continue
working
together
in
this
fashion
to
promote
real
solutions
that
will
directly
help
create
a
better
environment
for
job-creation
and
restore
America&#8217;s
faith
in
our
ability
to
work
together
to
get
the
job
done.
The
Save
American
Workers
Act
Unfortunately,
we
all
know
people
who
are
currently
looking
for
employment
and
who
are
unable
to
care
for
their
families
as
they
would
like.
On
top
of
the
insurance
cancellation
notices,
higher
premiums,
and
reduced
hours
Americans
are
seeing
as
a
result
of
Obamacare,
the
law
is
forcing
job
creators
to
cut
employees&#8217;
hours
in
order
to
comply,
and
hindering
them
from
creating
new
jobs.
Thanks
to
Obamacare,
millions
of
already-struggling
Americans
are
having
an
even
harder
time
finding
work,
caring
for
their
families,
and
putting
food
on
their
tables
because
Obamacare
is
putting
full-time
work
and
decent
wages
out
of
reach.
I
speak
with
small
business
owners
all
across
central
and
eastern
Kentucky,
and
they
want
to
put
people
back
to
work.
They
want
to
invest
and
grow
their
business.
They
want
to
be
able
to
provide
healthcare
to
their
employees.
That
is
why
I
am
glad
to
be
a
cosponsor
of
Congressman
Todd
Young&#8217;s
legislation,
the
Save
American
Workers
Act,
which
the
House
passed
on
Thursday.
This
legislation
would
simply
repeal
the
30-hour
definition
of
&#8220;full-time
employment&#8221;
in
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
and
restore
the
traditional
40-hour
definition.
This
proposal
helps
employees
who
are
seeing
their
hours
cut
and
lowers
the
tax
burden
and
regulatory
cost
on
our
nation&#8217;s
small
businesses.
And
according
to
the
nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget
Office,
it
would
also
create
$75
billion
in
higher
cash
wages
for
American
workers.
At
a
time
when
Americans
are
struggling,
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
invest
in
real
solutions
like
the
Save
American
Workers
Act
of
2014
that
would
grow
the
economy
and
get
the
country
working
again.

Sexual
Assault
Awareness
Month
April
is
National
Sexual
Assault
Awareness
and
Prevention
Month,
where
we
have
an
opportunity
to
recommit
ourselves
to
raising
awareness
and
promoting
the
prevention
of
sexual
violence.
As
a
husband,
father,
uncle,
and
brother,
stopping
sexual
violence
is
of
utmost
importance
to
me.
Last
year
the
crisis
of
sexual
assault
in
the
military
was
brought
to
my
attention
in
a
much
more
personal
and
meaningful
way
when
a
constituent
survivor
came
to
my
office
to
tell
me
her
story.
What
this
constituent,
a
veteran
of
our
armed
services,
shared
with
me
was
not
just
that
she
had
been
a
victim
of
unwanted
sexual
conduct
during
her
active
duty
service
in
the
1990&#8217;s,
but
also
that
she
had
struggled
in
the
years
since
leaving
the
military
unable
to
access
the
services
that
she
need
to
treat
and
overcome
the
trauma
she
had
suffered.
Unfortunately,
these
constituents
and
their
concerns
are
far
from
uncommon.
According
to
the
Pentagon,
an
unprecedented
26,000
military
personnel
were
sexually
assaulted
in
2012.
While
there
is
clearly
much
to
be
done
to
address
the
prevention
of
these
assaults,
there
is
an
immediate
need
to
change
the
system
so
we
can
help
military
sexual
trauma
(MST)
survivors
who
are
trying
to
get
the
care
they
need.
This
is
why
I
authored
and
introduced
H.R.
3775,
the
Military
Sexual
Assault
Victims
Empowerment
Act,
also
known
as
the
Military
SAVE
Act ,
which
would
empower
survivors
of
military
sexual
trauma
to
select
their
own
care
providers
and
provide
the
support
these
brave
service
members
have
earned.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
these
survivors
fought
and
sacrificed
for
their
country
and
we
must
honor
the
commitment
that
this
country
has
made
to
them.
I
am
honored
to
stand
with
survivors
and
their
families
and
look
forward
to
working
with
my
cosponsors
and
colleagues
on
the
House
Military
Sexual
Assault
Prevention
Caucus
to
continue
advancing
this
legislation
so
we
can
give
these
heroes
the
best
healthcare
they
need,
the
best
healthcare
they
deserve,
and
the
best
healthcare
that
they
have
earned.
I
am
grateful
for
the
wide,
bipartisan
support
this
legislation
has
received .

I
was
humbled
to
recognize
one

small
part
of
recognizing
his
heroism.
If
you
are
facing
troubles
with
obtaining
service
medals,
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
contact
my
office.
As
a
Member
of
Congress,
it
is
an
honor
to
assist
our
veterans
by
acknowledging
their
brave
acts
of
valor.
Getting
Serious
About
Reducing
Spending
For
far
too
long,
Washington
has
failed
to
take
its
spending
problem
and
its
budgetary
responsibilities
seriously.
At
a
time
when
Kentucky
families
are
struggling
to
stretch
every
dime,
I
am
committed
to
reducing
federal
spending,
setting
priorities
that
honor
hard-working
taxpayers,
protecting
central
and
eastern
Kentucky
interests,
and
promoting
economic
growth
that
will
create
jobs.
Every
hardworking
taxpayer
in
America
knows
that
they
have
to
have
a
budget
and
that
you
can&#8217;t
continue
to
spend
money
that
you
don&#8217;t
have.
That&#8217;s
why
I
supported
the
No
Budget,
No
Pay
Act,
which
said
simply
that
Members
of
Congress
should
not
get
paid
if
they
fail
to
fulfill
the
most
basic
responsibility
of
governing:
passing
a
budget.
The
No
Budget,
No
Pay
Act
was
the
first
step
in
an
effort
to
bring
real
fiscal
responsibility
to
Washington.
The
current
debt
limit
law
is
a
failure
that
does
nothing
to
actually
limit
spending
or
remove
the
threat
of
default.
It
is
time
to
stop
allowing
politicians
to
spend
money
today
only
to
worry
about
how
to
pay
for
it
tomorrow.
That&#8217;s
why
I
also
introduced
legislation,
H.R.
4021,
the
Debt
Limit
Reform
and
Congressional
Pay
for
Performance
Act
of
2014,
to
change
the
way
Washington
works
by
advancing
a
new,
much-needed
solution
that
will
that
would
create
a
new
formula
for
establishing
the
debt
ceiling
based
on
the
size
of
the
economy
and
a
declining
schedule
of
spending
targets.
To
make
sure
Congress
is
committed
to
making
the
tough
decisions,
each
Member
of
Congress&#8217;
compensation
would
be
tied
to
their
ability
to
meet
a
yearly
fiscal
sustainability
target.
Please
continue
to
let
me
know
your
thoughts
and
concerns
about
issues
facing
our
community,
and
I
hope
you
will
forward
my
weekly
newsletter
to
your
friends,
family
and
neighbors.

great
