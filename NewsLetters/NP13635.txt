Dear
Friend,
It has been a busy week here and in the Capitol, with a number
of weighty issues of importance to Arizona being debated before the
holiday break.
On Monday, I traveled to Tucson to hear
testimony about what is needed to facilitate trade with Mexico at our
border.
This important issue often is overlooked in the debate about
security but is vitally important to our Arizona economy and business
community.
We heard testimony about the impact of wait times for
commercial vehicles at border crossings.
It is vital that we
offer a secure border, but one that provides for the smooth flow of
commerce. We are seeking a consistently applied measurement of wait times
and delays so we can better understand the security and technology and
solutions that can be brought to bear to enhance the flow of
commerce.

here.
On
Tuesday, I joined my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology
Committee in asking the President to present a plan for increased web
security of Healthcare.gov by December 18 th
to confront the
lack of security in the Obamacare website.
You can read the
letter
here.
Wednesday, members of the Small Business
Committee held a hearing to demanded answers from the Administration
about the Affordable Care Acts impact on small businesses. Earlier this
month, we heard from small business owners that skyrocketing insurance
premiums, the instability of rates and the uncertainty around ACA
implementation is hurting business growth and contributing to factors
that have caused small employers to fall behind in economic recovery from
the recession.

On Monday, my
colleagues and I learned of a need for more data on trade operations and
oversight at our borders. We need to overlay our current business
opportunities with a better understanding of wait times at
checkpoints.
To
confront the lack of security in the Obamacare website, I joined my
colleagues in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee in asking the
President to present a plan for increased web security of Healthcare.gov by
December 18th.
Earlier this
month, we heard from small business owners that their insurance premiums
are skyrocketing as uncertainty in the implementation of the
Presidents health care plan. I'm asking for data so we can measure and assess
the real impact of Obamacare on small businesses going forward.
