Dear Friend:
Thank you for taking the time to read my
e-newsletter.
THE SUPREME COURT AND PRESIDENTIAL
OVERREACH
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued two key
rulings on executive overreach.
In the Hobby Lobby case, it
properly rejected an Obamacare mandate
that infringed
on the principle of religious liberty that has been integral to
America since our founding days .
The court also unanimously
ruled that the President has exceeded his recess appointment power, a
concern I raised publicly when the director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) was installed without Senate
confirmation.
The House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, has consistently
challenged actions by the President and agencies like the EPA that have
attempted to sidestep the legislative process and the separation of
powers doctrine.

THOSE MISSING IRS EMAILS
The disappearance of
thousands of IRS emails that could shed new light on the targeting of
political groups is not acceptable.
The standard practice for
offices that experience computer crashes is to immediately bring in IT
experts to retrieve lost data.
In an
exchange with Treasury Secretary Lew that you can view here , I said
the excuse being given by the IRS has a "the dog ate my homework" sound
and the investigation into this troubling matter must dig
deeper.
DATA PRIVACY AND THE CFPB
The
government's recent handling of private information further heightens my
concern about a massive financial data collection project underway at
the CFPB.
Information from tens of millions of mortgage holders
is being compiled for regulators.
When CFPB Director Richard
Cordray testified in front of the Financial Services Committee,
I expressed skepticism that the sensitive data could be
adequately protected
and questioned why some - if not all - of
the information is being collected at all.
THE SURGE
AT THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER
On June 25, the
Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the surge of minors at the Mexican
border hoping to gain entry into the U.S.
We cannot sustain a
situation where tens of thousands of individuals suddenly arrive for entry,
in some cases having taken a perilous journey under the mistaken
impression that they will receive "permits."
In my view, the
President's muddled immigration policy has worsened an already bad
situation.
The very clear expectation set at the hearing was that tangible
and prompt action must be taken to restore order and dissuade criminal
smuggling, and a special task force has been appointed to report to
the House on the progress.
FREE TRADE MUST BE FAIR
TRADE
American workers can compete and win against
anyone in the world, but it's not a fair fight when foreign companies
dump products and evade trade laws.
That is why I was proud to be
invited to speak at a "Save Our Steel" rally in Alabama.
Fair
trade is about jobs, families, our economy, and our national
security.
The U.S. has long benefited from open markets, but those markets
must not be exploited.

RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN
SUDAN
With many colleagues, I am seeking a strong U.S. response
in the case of a Christian woman, Meriam Yehya Ibrahim Ishag, who is
being persecuted in Sudan because of her faith.
The Sudanese
government's treatment of this innocent wife and mother and her family -
which includes the threat of a death sentence - is beyond deplorable
and violates all international norms.
In the House, I am the
cosponsor of a resolution that condemns the actions of the Sudanese
government and I have also signed a letter to Secretary of State Kerry on
this urgent matter that you can view by

SIXTH DISTRICT ART CONTEST WINNER
VISITS WASHINGTON
The artwork of Emily White of Hoover
is being displayed at the U.S. Capitol as part of the Congressional
Art Competition.
It was a pleasure to meet with Miss White when
she was in Washington for the opening of the exhibit.
She and all
of the students who created artwork for the contest showed great
creativity and put in much hard work.

BRINGING AMERICAN HISTORY
ALIVE
As we prepare to celebrate the Fourth of July,
it's appropriate to reflect on the importance of being knowledgeable
about American history.
Two dedicated educators helping to bring
U.S. history alive, especially for young people, are Tom Walker of
American Village in Montevallo and Stewart McLaurin, the new president of
the White House Historical Association.
As I noted in a column on
appreciating America's history that you can
read
here , through an awareness of history, we can come to better
understand ourselves as Americans and the privilege we have of being
citizens of this exceptional nation.
