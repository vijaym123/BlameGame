Representative
Scott
Perry
March 2, 2014
This week the House voted on a series of bills that will eliminate or reform burdensome laws and regulations, as well as help increase transparency and accountability.
These bills were part of the larger House effort of remaining focused on plans to help create jobs, grow the economy, and make life better for hard-working middle-class Americans. Sluggish job growth, higher health care costs, and an out-of-control government arent what hard-working Americans deserve.

These bills are part of the Houses larger effort to make Washington more accountable and stop job stifling regulations or executive orders that hurt economic growth and freedom. We must get Washington out of the way - whether at the doctors office, in the job market, or at the gas pump - to build an America that works.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
