Dear Friend,
San Antonio is a city on the rise. We are a city with a vision and the
determination to create opportunities for hard-working folks who want
to contribute to our community and strengthen our economy.
San Antonio
is the only U.S. city with more than 1 million people to receive a AAA
bond rating by the three leading financial rating agencies. Industry
employers in sectors such as aerospace, healthcare, and energy are
creating jobs and attracting folks from all over the country to our
city.
And it is making a difference. San Antonio was recently named
the top city for new brainpower.
A major component behind our city's success is our small business
community.
Home to thousands of small businesses, San Antonio
continues to be revitalized through these investments.
In Texas, small businesses represent 98.7% of all employers and employ
almost half of the private-sector labor force.
As we continue our work
in Congress to strengthen our economy, we must not cut opportunities
for these businesses.
It is important that we focus on initiatives
that enhance and improve growth and progress, especially for women,
minority, and veteran owned businesses.
We must continue to encourage
development and create opportunities to help businesses grow, access
credit, and hire new workers.
Congressional STEM Competition
Last weekend, I hosted the first ever Congressional Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic Competition, the "House
App Contest."
Teams of students from area high schools developed apps
that look for solutions to community-wide issues like unemployment and
safety, as well as developed tools to make everyday things more
practical like studying for tests.
The students demonstrated how
important and practical a STEM education really is in our daily lives
and I was very impressed by each of the teams that competed.
The winning app was "Cards For A Cause" created by students from the
International School of the Americas and St. Mary's Hall, which helps
students study flashcards right from their phones.
All profits from
the app will be put towards fighting illiteracy.
The team will have
their app displayed on the House of Representatives website and in the
U.S. Capitol for a year.
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy.
As such, it is
important for Congress to continue to explore ways to help spark growth
within this community.
I am dedicated to working with my colleagues to
ensure we safeguard the initiatives to do so.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
Join Me....
In Case You Missed It
I expressed concern about political unrest in Venezuela and encouraged
the United States to stand up for democracy and human rights. LINK

Use

COMMENT:
Table

do
not
always

be
set
to
zero
before
publishing
unless
the
design
is
very
simple

Only
declare

The

text-alignment
(left/right/centered)

By

DIV
(Division),

in
your

COMMENT:
You
can
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the
HTML

you
will

COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of
style,
size
and
table
attributes
that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
can,
however,
stack
shorter
tables
on
top
of
each
other
to
form
one
very
long
series
of
tables
and
avoid
the

in

Congressional
STEM
Competition
Last
weekend,
I
hosted
the
first
ever
Congressional
Science,
Technology,
Engineering
and
Math
(STEM)
Academic
Competition,
the
&#8220;House
App
Contest.&#8221;
Teams
of
students
from
area
high
schools
developed
apps
that
look
for
solutions
to
community-wide
issues
like
unemployment
and
safety,
as
well
as
developed
tools
to
make
everyday
things
more
practical
like
studying
for
tests.
The
students
demonstrated
how
important
and
practical
a
STEM
education
really
is
in
our
daily
lives
and
I
was
very
impressed
by
each
of
the
teams
that
competed.
The
winning
app
was
&#8220;Cards
For
A
Cause&#8221;
created
by
students
from
the
International
School
of
the
Americas
and
St.
Mary&#8217;s
Hall,
which
helps
students
study
flashcards
right
from
their
phones.
All
profits
from
the
app
will be
put
towards
fighting
illiteracy.
The
team
will
have
their
app
displayed
on
the
House
of
Representatives
website
and
in
the
U.S.
Capitol
for
a
year.
Small
businesses are
the
backbone
of
our
economy.
As
such,
it
is
important
for
Congress
to
continue
to
explore
ways
to
help
spark
growth
within
this
community.
I
am
dedicated
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
ensure
we
safeguard
the
initiatives
to
do
so.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
