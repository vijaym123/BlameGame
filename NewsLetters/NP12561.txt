Dear Fellow Coloradan,
Colorado's story is one of opportunity and perseverance in the face of adversity. That has been true throughout our state&rsquo;s history &mdash; a history that has been shaped by the pivotal role played by African Americans, among many others. Black History Month is an opportunity to celebrate the contributions African Americans have made to expanding access to opportunity across Colorado and around our nation.
Many of these leaders are well-known for their efforts to empower their fellow Coloradans. Elizabeth A. Lee, president of the National Council of Negro Women Denver Section and a committed volunteer, has supported her community for years by dedicating her time to organizations like the Boys and Girls Club and Single Mothers of Color. And Phillip A. Washington, the head of public transportation in Denver, is helping get Coloradans back to work with his Workforce Initiative Now, a program that helps urban workers get the skills and training they need to find good-paying jobs.
Do you have an idea for how we can empower our neighbors and expand opportunity for all Coloradans? Please share it with me .
African Americans in Colorado have also been powerful forces for progress and social change. Nearly 30 years ago, the honorable former First Lady of Denver and State Rep. Wilma J. Webb &mdash; inducted into the Colorado Women&rsquo;s Hall of Fame in 1991 &mdash; led the successful effort to establish a statewide holiday to mark Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s birthday. Because of Wilma&rsquo;s tireless efforts, Denver now hosts the largest celebration in the nation honoring Dr. King&rsquo;s legacy each year.
It was a privilege to once again walk alongside my fellow Coloradans in this year&rsquo;s Marade and celebrate Dr. King&rsquo;s vision for a better, more perfect union.
These Coloradans exemplify the fearless leadership that is helping our state close gaps in achievement and improve access to economic opportunity &mdash; steps which are critical to encouraging upward mobility and ensuring that every American can achieve their goals if they work hard and never give up.
Make your voice heard and join my call to ensure all Americans have equal access to opportunity .
Despite the progress we&rsquo;ve made over the last 50 years, there&rsquo;s plenty left to do in our communities and in Congress to ensure opportunity for all. We must protect the right to vote and other foundational liberties for current Coloradans while investing in our shared future. Most importantly, we need to do more to provide our children with the skills and education the 21st century global economy demands of them. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve fought to expand student loans and keep student loan rates low and ensure that a high-quality education and job training programs are within reach for all Coloradans. We must make sure no student is denied the chance to excel.
Coloradans know there will always be new challenges to face and higher obstacles to overcome. But I&rsquo;m confident that, through our shared commitment to our country, hard work, and our values, we can continue to open doors for our neighbors and children.
Join my call to redouble our efforts to confront the challenges of inequality and unequal access to opportunity head-on so that the promise of our Declaration of Independence is within reach of all Coloradans .
Warm regards,
Offices
