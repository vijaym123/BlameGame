20TH DISTRICT
August 04, 2014
Dear David,
As your
Congressman, I occasionally send out e-mail newsletters to keep you informed
on my work in Washington and throughout the Capital Region. These
newsletters cover a variety of topics ranging from community events to
legislative updates.
I am writing to alert
you that, due to U.S. House rules concerning communication before
elections, I will be limited in ways I can communicate with you for the
next three months.
In order to stay up to
date on important information, including my work on your behalf, I
encourage you to sign up to receive e-mails during this period by
clicking here . Please know that if you
opt-in to receive emails, you can opt-out at any
time.
I look forward to keeping you informed of my efforts in
the House to serve our community. In the meantime, if my office can
ever be of assistance to you or someone you know, please do not hesitate
to give me a call. My door is always
open.
Thanks for reading,
How do you prefer to
communicate with me and my office?
