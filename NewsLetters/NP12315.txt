Friend,
While our opponents are gaining the support of national Tea Party groups, we&#39;re proud to announce that Congressman Bera has been endorsed by both the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the Sierra Club.
Ami&#39;s voting record and commitment to important issues earned him these endorsements. He is unwavering in his support of Planned Parenthood and his belief that women should make their own healthcare decisions without government intrusion, and he is a leading voice in Congress for the environmental issues that the Sierra Club champions.
His positions are all the more critical in light of other lawmakers who ignore scientific facts about climate change and who try to pass extreme measures to limit a woman&#39;s right to choose.
Endorsements like these help fuel our campaign, but we can&#39;t light the fire without you.

Can you sign here to let him know you&#39;re in for 2014?
