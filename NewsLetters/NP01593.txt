Friend,
You are always there when I need you.
Thank you for stepping up last week when we found out that national groups are already targeting our district.
You helped us send a message that our district won&#39;t be swayed by special interest dollars.
Last week also marked our first 100 days in Congress this year.
While we&#39;ve made some progress on issues such as SGR reform, there is still much to do.
I would like your thoughts--

We need to lower the cost of higher education, make sure Social Security is secure for the next generation, and ensure that good paying jobs are accessible to our friends and neighbors.
These priorities matter and I&#39;m fighting to break the partisan gridlock to have a real conversation about the issues impacting our families.
Your voice is important.

I appreciate your input and support.
Be well,
Ami
