The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of March 31 - April 4, 2014
This week our neighbors in Central Texas were once again shocked by a
senseless act of violence at Fort Hood.
It is with a heavy heart that
I send my condolences to the families who lost loved ones and prayers
to all who were injured.
It pains me to hear that the brave men and women who put their lives on
the line for our freedom faced such a devastating tragedy here at home.
I am extremely grateful for the brave first responders who aided those
in harm's way and I stand ready to support the Fort Hood community in
any way possible.
Save American Workers Act
On Thursday the House approved H.R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act
, which
repeals ObamaCare's misguided 30-hour rule. This rule redefines "full
time" employment as 30 hours per week instead of 40.
Due to the
looming employer mandate, businesses are reducing workers' hours to 29
hours per week or less to avoid ObamaCare's high costs and taxes -
leaving millions of middle and low-wage workers with less take home
pay.
At a time when millions of Americans are unemployed or underemployed, I
believe we should focus on getting Washington out of the way to promote
job growth and economic prosperity instead of higher taxes. I was proud
to support the Save American Workers Act to protect jobs and restore
wages to provide financial stability for American families.
Pro-Growth Budgeting Act
On Friday the House approved the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act
, which
would require the Congressional Budget Office to provide Congress and
the American people with a more comprehensive analysis of how
legislation will impact job creation and our economy. The new model
would help us better understand the long-term fiscal impact of a bill
before it's passed, which is increasingly important during this time of
continued slow economic growth.
I was proud to support this
responsible bill that will help us in our efforts to reenergize the
free enterprise system and put our nation on a more sustainable path.
Constituent Meetings
On Wednesday I had the opportunity to have lunch with constituents from
the American Lighting Association during their visit to our nation's
capital. We had a great discussion about expanding the development of
domestic energy supplies and other important issues that affect the
lighting industry and North Texas consumers.

Lighting Association
Later in the day I met with constituents from the Forging Industry
Association. During our meeting, we talked about various issues that
impact their industry such as comprehensive tax reform, energy policy,
and regulatory overreach. It is always a pleasure to sit down with
constituents to discuss ways that we can work together to achieve their
legislative goals.

from
Congressman
Pete

Week

April

2014
This
week
our
neighbors
in
Central
Texas
were
once
again
shocked
by
a
senseless
act
of
violence
at
Fort
Hood.
It
is
with
a
heavy
heart
that
I
send
my
condolences
to
the
families
who
lost
loved
ones
and
prayers
to
all
who
were
injured.
It
pains
me
to
hear
that
the
brave
men
and
women
who
put
their
lives
on
the
line
for
our
freedom
faced
such
a
devastating
tragedy
here
at
home.
I
am
extremely
grateful
for
the
brave
first
responders
who
aided
those
in
harm&#8217;s
way
and
I
stand
ready
to
support
the
Fort

the

H.R.

Act
On
Friday
the
House
approved
the
Pro-Growth

Act ,
which
would
require
the
Congressional
Budget

to
provide
Congress
and
the
American
people
with
a

analysis
of
how
legislation
will
impact
job
creation
and

The

would

fiscal
impact
of
a

before

which
is
increasingly
important
during

of
continued

I

that
will

in
