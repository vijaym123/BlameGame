Well its the end of the week
and time for the boarding pass. Im back in D.C. after spending some
time in the district for elections and Im so proud that yall have
chosen me to be your representative for the 114 th
Congress.
This week is usually an organizational
week where we elect Republican leaders and write the rules for our
Republican conference, which is very important since Republicans now have
the majority in the House and the
Senate.
Today we voted for something that has needed to be passed for the past
five years, and that is a vote for the Keystone Pipeline. The bill
passed the House by a vote of 252-161 (See
Roll Call
#519 ). 42,000 jobs are estimated to be created by the Keystone
Pipeline and it is expected to lower dependency on foreign oil by 40%. This
pipeline is well overdue. I urge the Senate to pass this
bill.
During the rest of the lame duck we plan on
voting on an appropriation package to keep the government open, and since
Im a Chairman of an Appropriations Subcommittee I expect to be kept
very busy this month.
The Ebola crisis is going to be addressed,
the Defense Authorization bill will be addressed and we will address
the conflicts abroad.
It is important
that you communicate your thoughts on these issues so please make sure to
visit my website
carter.house.gov
and email me
your opinion. Thats our boarding pass and Ill see all you folks in
Texas, Ill be there around 8 PM tonight. I get back to D.C. next
Monday for another busy week.
