Dear
Friend,
Last week in
Washington, House Republicans took major steps towards addressing three
major issues: VA reform, executive overreach, and the crisis on our
southern border. On each of these issues, I am happy to report that I
voted to support the position best reflects the values and beliefs of the
people of the Fifth Congressional
District.
While much work remains to clean out the
culture of corruption that has long festered in the VA, the Joint
House-Senate Conference legislation is an important and necessary first step.
In my position as one of the chief negotiators in the Conference
Committee, I made sure that VA leadership was given the power to fire
failing employees and that veterans had access to expanded private sector
care options. These two provisions should lead to fewer entitled
employees and lower wait time and increased care options for our
veterans.
It was a serious,
but necessary, vote to bring a lawsuit against President Obama. For
too long, administrations of both parties have been too expansive with
their use and interpretation of the power of Executive Orders.
Congress is a coequal branch of government that has the power to make laws.
The Constitution limits a president to faithfully executing the laws.
The time has come for the people's Representatives in Congress to stand
up and ensure that we have standing and a voice in our judicial
system, in order to begin paring back abuses of power by the executive
branch.
The situation on
our southern border is a humanitarian crisis and a grave national
security concern. The legislation passed late last week will increase the
National Guard presence, adds immigrations and customs officials, on a
temporary basis, to speed up the return of illegal immigrants to
their home countries, and stops President Obama from expanding his
executive orders encouraging illegals to flood the
border.

VA
REFORM
Following my service
on the Joint House-Senate VA Reform Conference Committee, I was
honored to support legislation instituting important reforms to the
Veterans Administration. The bill passed the House by an overwhelming vote of
420 to 5. Nothing is more important than providing our veterans
with the care and respect that they have earned. It was a privilege to
serve as a chief negotiator on the VA Reform Conference Committee. I
am pleased that we were able to come to a bipartisan solution. These
reforms expand the private sector care options available to our
veterans, ensuring that wait times are lower, and convenience is increased.
However, this alone will not fix the cultural problems that plague the
department so as to guarantee quality care for our veterans in the
long run.
That's why I worked hard to ensure that the bill included
measures that will hold bureaucrats accountable for failing to put
our veterans first. These are important steps in the process of
rebuilding the trust that has been broken between our brave veterans and the
VA that should serve them. The corrupt culture at the VA won't be
purged overnight and there is still a lot of work to do.
I will
continue to work with local veterans on individual cases and on the
Veterans Affairs Committee to address systemic problems that
remain.

I also sent a letter last
week to the new VA Secretary Robert McDonald. The letter highlights
local issues and concerns of vital importance here in the Fifth
Congressional District.
EXECUTIVE
OVERREACH
I voted for H.R. 676, the Authority to Initiate Litigation
Against the Executive Act. The bill passed the House by a vote of 225 to
201. The Peoples House cannot turn a blind eye to the lawlessness of
this President. We cannot pretend rampant illegalities arent taking
place. We must make it clear that the U.S. Congress is a coequal branch of
government representing we the
people.
SOUTHERN BORDER
CRISIS
The crisis at our southern border, where
Central American children have fled to by the thousands, is the direct
result of the Obama administrations reckless actions in an effort to
circumvent Congress to provide amnesty to illegal immigrants. These
pieces of legislation are critical steps towards turning off the magnet
that has drawn thousands across our southern
border.
House-passed legislation accomplishes many things including: providing
funding to place the National Guard at the border, cuts back President
Obama's original funding request and specifically targets all funding to
fixing immediate problems at the southern border, Provides
additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement
officials, Increases the number of temporary immigration judges and officials to
expedite the return of illegal immigrants to their home
countries, Expresses the Sense of Congress that illegal immigrants should not be
held on military facilities, prevents the President from taking
executive action to expand his deferred action for illegal immigrants DACA
plan, and is fully paid for by taking back unspent funds from
various
agencies.
DEVELOPMENTS IN
ISRAEL
I partnered with my Democrat colleague,
Congressman Brad Schneider (IL-10), in leading a bipartisan group of
149 lawmakers on a letter calling on the United Nations to make the
removal of Hamass rocket arsenal a top priority. The U.Ns purpose is to
save mankind from the scourge of war and to defend fundamental human
rights, but it is failing to do just that. For some time now, the U.N
has wrongfully and instinctively condemned Israel. While Israel
practices the greatest caution trying to prevent civilian casualties, Hamas
uses civilians to protect the rockets it launches at Israel. It is time
for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to take the necessary steps to
remove these rockets, and to support Israel in the effort to destroy the
deadly
tunnels.

latest development in
Israel
Text of
Letter
Dear Mr.
Secretary
General,
The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has embarked
on its third campaign in six years of terrorizing a civilian
population by indiscriminately firing nearly two thousand rockets into Israeli
airspace.
As well, Hamas has built a network of underground
tunnels from Gaza into Israel with the express intent of killing and
capturing Israelis.
There has been enough suffering in both
Israel and Gaza as a direct result of Hamass rocket arsenal. We, the
elected representatives of the American people, call on the United
Nations to formally recognize Gaza's rockets as an impenetrable barrier to
regional peace, and to make their immediate removal a top
priority.
After ten days of unrelenting, indiscriminate attacksfrom rockets,
through the tunnels, and from the seaIsrael entered Gaza on July 17 with
the mission of eliminating the tunnels and ending the rocket fire.
Meanwhile, rocket sirens continue to sound all across Israel, with
over 75% of Israels civilian population living within range of
Hamas fire.
More than 9,000 rockets have been fired out of Gaza since
2001. Once considered to be short-range threats with minimal payloads,
Hamas has continuously improved the range and lethality of these rockets
to ensure a maximum threat to Israel.
Hamas can now reach
virtually every major population center in Israel, with deadly effect.
Today, every rocket fired puts the long-sought peace between Israel
and the Palestinians further out of
reach.
But rather than respond in
kind to each and every rocket attack, Israel has countered the rocket
threat by developing a rocket defense system known as Iron Dome. The
Iron Dome system has saved countless Israeli lives, including in this
most recent
conflict.
After more than a decade of deadly attacks, it is
now absolutely clear that the international community cannot tolerate
the rocket stockpiles in Gaza.
While the rockets terrorize
Israelis, they also endanger Gaza's children, women, and men. Hamas embeds
its rockets and rocket launchers among civilian populations and
publicly declares it the duty of every Palestinian to put his or her life on
the line to protect them. The firing of rockets intentionally
targeting Israeli civilians and the use of Palestinian civilians as human
shields are both war
crimes.
Israel continues to warn the population in
Gaza before striking weapons caches and rocket launchers.
These
advanced warnings seek to save the lives of innocent Palestinians, and
do so at grave risk to Israel Defense Forces troops. Yet, in spite of
these efforts, many innocent civilians have lost their lives in the
crossfire and collateral damage to property still occurs.
Tragically, this is exactly what Hamas' leadership is counting
on.
We urge the
United Nations to take the steps necessary to make the removal of
Hamass rockets a top priority.
Doing so will bring much needed
stability to a region that has been plagued by terror and suffering for
too long and is imperative to any effort to bring a lasting peace to
the people of Israel and Gaza.

SAYING "THANK YOU" TO AN EXCEPTIONAL LOCAL MILITARY
LEADER
I paid tribute to Air Force Space Command Commander,
General William Shelton with a speech on the House Floor. General
Shelton is coming to the end of a career spanning four decades in the
United States Air Force that began at the Air Force Academy and ended at
Air Force Space Command, both located here in the Fifth Congressional
District. Please join me in congratulating General Shelton and his
family on his
retirement!

Text of
Speech
Mister Speaker, I rise today to recognize
General William L. Shelton, Commander of Air Force Space Command, on the
occasion of his retirement from the United States Air
Force.
Over the
course of his 38-year career in the United States Air Force, General
Shelton has served with great distinction and made countless
sacrifices for our country. We commend his service; the sacrifices of his
family in support of his service, including his wife Linda and their two
children Sara and Joel; and must express our great appreciation for his
leadership and devotion to our Nations
security.
A graduate of the United
States Air Force Academy, General Sheltons selection as the
Commander of Air Force Space Command in January 2011 culminates a
distinguished career that began in 1976 at the Space and Missile Test Center at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. In a career dedicated to the
space enterprise, he commanded units at Falcon/Schriever, F.E. Warren,
Offutt, Vandenberg, and Peterson Air Force Bases. He also provided
valuable leadership and counsel to the Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of
Staff of the Air Force and Joint Staff community during multiple
Headquarters U.S. Air Force assignments. His positive leadership directly
influenced countless men and women in our Armed Forces, and the
enduring effects of his service to our country will be felt for years to
come.
General Shelton has been a vigilant advocate for national security space
programs. As the Commander of Air Force Space Command, he was
responsible for organizing, training and equipping more than 40,000 military
and civilian personnel to assure space and cyberspace capabilities for
the Combatant Commands and for the Nation. While space and cyberspace
capabilities clearly contribute to making our military unmatched in
combat operations, they also have become essential in humanitarian and
disaster relief efforts and are now vital assets for the global
community and world
economy.
Through his leadership, we enjoy
unprecedented success in the areas of space launch and acquisition which have led
to greater mission assurance and cost savings across the Department of
Defense. Further, his vision on future space capabilities will
position us to make the changes necessary to provide resilient, capable and
affordable space capabilities for the joint force and the Nation well
into the
future.
General Shelton established an unmatched and sustained
level of success during a time of increasing challenges. He has worked
closely with the House Armed Services Committee, and it has been my
great pleasure to work with him in that important capacity. His frank and
informed discussions on our space systems, particularly the Global
Positioning Satellite system, have helped leaders and citizens around
the world appreciate the value and need to protect our Nations
foundational space capabilities. As a member of the House Armed Services
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, I am grateful for General Sheltons wise
counsel and firm resolve to always do what is best for the Nation and
for the Airmen he has
led.
With nearly four decades of exemplary service
to our Nation, General William L. Shelton deserves our most heartfelt
gratitude and praise. Thank you, General Shelton
and best wishes to
you and your
family.

Thanks for taking a stand, Congressman. It's
encouraging to see that we do indeed have REPRESENTATIVES advocating on
the part of the people they represent; that understand that this is a
"...government OF the people, BY the people and FOR the people..."
Clearly, President Obama is in fact over-reaching by his abuse of executive
privilege.
