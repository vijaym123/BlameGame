Dear Friends,
I invite you to join me for my next
Telephone Town Hall scheduled for Tuesday, March 4th from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. PST . To participate in the Telephone Town Hall, please
sign up here
before Monday, March 3rd at 6:00 p.m. PST.
Being able to speak to you directly is very important to me and that&rsquo;s why I hold telephone town halls on a regular basis. These town halls are your chance to share with me any concerns or questions you have.
Federal communication laws only permit me to call constituents who have signed up with a land line phone number, so please remember to sign up using a land line.
It is an honor to represent you in California&rsquo;s 14th Congressional District. You can also stay in touch by connecting with me on Twitter
@RepSpeier
and
Facebook .
All the best,
