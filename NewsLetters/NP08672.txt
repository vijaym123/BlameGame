Our veterans have sacrificed so
much for America, and the scandal revealed at VA facilities across
the country is an outrage. Its just the latest demonstration of a
bureaucracy badly in need of reform, and I will continue working with
Democrats and Republicans to ensure Americas veterans and wounded warriors
get the timely, professional medical care they have
earned.
Below is an overview of some of the work Im doing on your behalf.

Sincerely,
Congressman Pat
Meehan
Accountability at the V.A.
Last
week Congress took action to address the revelations of misconduct and
poor quality care at the VA.
Across the country 57,000 newly
enrolled veterans have waited more than three months for an
appointment at a VA hospital, and 64,000 who were previously enrolled have
never once been seen by a doctor. VA facilities in our area -- the VA
Hospitals in Philadelphia and Wilmington, and the clinic in Horsham
have
been identified for further review.
Last week, the House
has passed a number of bills, including the Demanding Accountability
for Veterans Act and the Veterans Access to Care Act, to ensure that
veterans facing long waits can receive care at a private hospital and
that leaders at the VA who arent getting the job done can be removed.
It's the latest in a series of bills passed with bipartisan support that
address the crisis at the VA.
Putting
an end to Human Trafficking
Congressman Meehan
meets with Montgomery County DA Risa Rerman and other experts to discuss
human trafficking on May 27, 2014.
Human trafficking is a $32 billion a year
industry, second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form
of transnational crime. Both in Washington and in Pennsylvania, I have
been working with my colleagues to pass legislation and develop
strategies to combat human trafficking and protect those who fall victim to
it.
Recently, I
held a roundtable
discussion
about human trafficking with Montgomery County District
Attorney Risa Ferman, along with members of local and federal law
enforcement as well as trafficking victims advocates in the Philadelphia
region. Last month, the House passed several pieces of legislation aimed to
address the crisis of human trafficking in this country and around
the world. An outline of the bills that were passed with bipartisan
support can be found
here.
This will be a topic that
Congress will likely revisit later this year.
Commerce-Science-Justice Appropriations
Bills
Congress recently passed a Justice Department funding bill that
includes new investment for a number of programs important to our region,
even as the overall bill cuts $400 million in wasteful spending compared
to last year. I successfully fought for more investment in veterans
treatment courts and programs that support victims of sexual
violence.
The recently passed legislation
included:
-$426 million
for the Office on Violence Against Women. Last year, I
led the effort in the House to reauthorize the Violence Against
Women Act.
-$14 million for
Veterans Treatment Courts, an increase of $10 million over last year.
In the 111 th
Congress, I was instrumental in
securing the first federal funding for veterans
courts.
-$45 million to enable the
Department of Justice to create federal human trafficking task forces
across the nation.
