Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Healthcare Oversight Hearing in Gastonia
The people of North Carolina have faced some of the highest premium increases under Obamacare.
Forbes estimates that the average premium price for individuals in North Carolina will increase 136% because of the President's healthcare law.
This Friday I hosted a hearing of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee at the Gaston County Courthouse in Gastonia examining this subject.
The hearing was the first in a series of four field hearings on the implementation of Obamacare.
It was titled "Obamacare Implementation: Sticker Shock of Increased Premiums for Healthcare Coverage."
I was joined at the hearing by Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (CA-49) and Congressman Robert Pittenger (NC-9).
We heard from North Carolina residents that have been directly impacted by Obamacare's skyrocketing premiums and poor coverage.
Below are some photos from the hearing:

If You Like It, You Should Be Able to Keep It
Following last week's House vote on the Keep Your Health Plan Act I wrote an op-ed for local newspapers in the 10th District.
It ran in most local papers including the Asheville Citizen-Times, the Hickory Daily Record, and the Gaston Gazette.
The bill is simple-commonsense legislation allowing Americans to keep the health care plans they like under the Affordable Care Act as President Obama promised.
It passed with the support of all but 3 Republicans and 39 Democrats.
Click the image below to read my op-ed on why I supported this legislation and why it is so important for the Senate to bring it up for a vote immediately:
Examining the Disparate Impact Theory
This week my Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee held a hearing examining the disparate impact theory.
The disparate impact theory is a legal theory that utilizes statistics to prove discrimination.
The focus of this hearing was on its use in housing and lending policy.

What I Have Been Reading
SEC Weighs Altering Rule on Private Deals
Wall Street Journal
The main goal of the JOBS Act which passed in 2012 was to expand access to capital for small businesses, thus creating more jobs.
One way to do this was to allow more Americans the opportunity to invest in startups by changing onerous securities regulations to expand the pool of those eligible to invest.
The article above, from Tuesday's print edition of the
Wall Street Journal,
details correspondence I have shared with SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White on this issue.

The Flight from Dallas
Esquire Magazine
This past Friday marked the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
I was fascinated by this nearly minute-by-minute account of what went on in Air Force One on that fateful day.
It is well worth the read especially considering this Friday's anniversary.
