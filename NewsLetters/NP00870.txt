Are the Taliban
terrorists?
On Thursday morning, America learned about another
attack by the Taliban in Afghanistan that killed an American civilian.
The President of Afghanistan immediately called the Taliban
terrorists and enemies. Meanwhile, the White House refuses to designate the
Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization.
Earlier this
year, I introduced a resolution calling on President Obama to speak
straight with the American people. Just hours after the news came of the
attack, the resolution was scheduled for a vote in the Judiciary
Committee. It passed, and the pressure is on the President to name our
enemies.
Watch my speech from the House floor by clicking
below:
Securing Our
Nation, Strengthening Our Military
Our American
military should not be dependent on other countries for our safety. We
must be able to build the weapons, gear, and vehicles for our servicemen
and women here in America. And when we meet with folks across West
Virginia, they tell us how important it is to protect and rebuild our
manufacturing base.
That is why I am proud the House passed a
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this week that ensures our
safety while helping American manufacturers who are the key to a
strong middle class. A new provision in the bill requires at least one
potential American supplier of rocket motors for tactical missiles be
considered by the Department of Defense.
In addition, two
amendments I offered were included in the final legislation. One encourages
research cooperation between the military and universities and the
other establishes a program to help Reservists keep track of their
service time.
Fighting EPA
Overreach
Every week, it seems, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is attempting to control more and more of our lives. On Tuesday, the
House voted to stop their latest destructive measure, an attempt to
regulate puddles and ditches on farms and at construction sites. These
are not the navigable waters EPA is allowed by law to regulate,
instead this is an abuse of their power.
For example, here is
one of the waters they want to regulate just as if it were a lake or
stream:
It defies common sense to punish farmers and
homeowners for something Mother Nature
controls.
Protecting the Most Vulnerable
I am proudly
pro-life and have been my entire life. That is why I voted on Wednesday to
protect unborn children capable of feeling pain. H.R. 36 strikes a
common-sense balance to defend the most vulnerable members of our
society. This bill is similar to West Virginias own law, which strikes a
common-sense balance supported by sound science and a majority of the
American people.
Congratulations
Graduate
Anthony Brutto will graduate from WVU this Sunday along
with 4,500 other students. Mr. Brutto deserves a special mention
though because he will earn his degree 70 years after beginning his
studies.
A war (World War II), raising a family, and a few
different careers sidetracked him, but it was always important to me to
graduate, he says. Read Mr. Bruttos full story

Have a great week,
David
