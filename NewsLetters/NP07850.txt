When you surf
the
internet
to check on a movie time,
read emails or research a product
you do so free of charge and free from
censorship.
The Internet in America has been free since its
inception
and we need to keep it that
way!
Thats why moments ago, I supported legislation to prohibit government
at any level from taxing access to the Internet.
The bipartisan
measure passed the House and now moves to the Senate.
The Internet is a powerful resource used daily by
millions of Americans to conduct business, access education,
communicate with family and friends, and more.
Its rapid proliferation is
the result of American innovation, free of government intrusion.
The United States must not follow in the footsteps of restrictive
societies like China, Iran, and North Korea that seek to regulate the
Internet as a means of suppressing their populace.
Specifically, the House-passed bill (H.R. 3086) would
permanently extend the current tax moratorium that prevents states and
localities from levying taxes on Internet access.
Its passage is
absolutely critical because the 1998 law banning Internet taxation is
set to officially expire on Nov. 1.
Failure to renew the ban
could place a substantial burden on American
families.
The National Taxpayers Union hailed the bipartisan proposal,
saying
any nation seeking to remain technologically and
economically competitive should not punish the very citizens who are reaching
out into the digital realm, especially by levying charges that are
unlikely to have anything to do with bettering Internet service.
I couldnt agree
more.
America has
always been a beacon of freedom, and we must continue to lead as a model
for other nations in this digital age.
At a time when countless
Americans are struggling to pay their bills, the last thing we need is
a new tax that hinders access to a free and open
Internet.
As always, please let me know what you
think!
