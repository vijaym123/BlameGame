Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
This weekend, it is so incredibly important for us to remember the true
meaning of Memorial Day and honor the service of those who made the
ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
I am so grateful for those who have given their lives for this country,
and for their families who live on with only memories of their heroes.
For all of the families who have lost a loved one in service, I want to
thank you for your sacrifice. And for all of the men and women actively
serving in our armed forces, I am grateful for your dedication and
patriotism today and every day.
I hope you have a safe and happy Memorial Day!
Listening to and Fighting for our Veterans
America's freedom is only possible because of the sacrifice and bravery
of our veterans. However, recent reports of gross mismanagement and
falsified data records at the VA, coupled with an utter lack of
accountability at the agency, denies our heroes the care they have more
than earned.
This is unconscionable and completely unacceptable.
That is why this week, I voted for the VA Management Accountability
Act, which would establish new accountability measures for the VA, to
help avoid further mistreatment of our veterans.
With more veterans and service members seeking care than ever before,
the need for higher standards is even more clear.
Last year, I began the Sixth District Veterans Coalition as a proactive
way to help find and enact solutions that will help the vets who have
so bravely served our country.
I have been working with the coalition to gather feedback from veterans
across central and eastern Kentucky regarding their care and the
service at the Lexington VA.
Last month, my office sent out a survey and we encourage all veterans
to take it as a way for us to hear directly from veterans across the
district
, including those who are in rural areas
and travel to Lexington for care.
I also authored and introduced H.R. 3775, the Military Sexual Assault
Victims Empowerment Act
, or the Military SAVE Act, which would
empower survivors of military sexual trauma to select their own care
providers and provide the support these brave service members have
earned.
The Military SAVE Act could help address the challenges facing the VA
by setting the precedent of providing these brave men and women the
very freedom of individual choice they have fought to protect.
Thank you to those who have already returned our survey, and I
encourage all veterans to fill the survey out online or call my office
with their input. If you know a veteran who would like to fill out the
survey, I hope you will pass on this information
.
I am committed to ensuring that our veterans are not subjected to that
kind of shameful treatment and will continue to work with the Coalition
and the VA in a partnership to promote and enact solutions.
Casework Corner: Helping a Veteran Obtain 18 Medals He Earned While
Serving
I am honored to share that recently, my office was able to help a
Lexington constituent who was facing issues with obtaining medals he
earned while serving in the Air Force.
After he had tried to navigate the bureaucracy and made no progress
with any agencies, he turned to us for assistance. Through working with
the National Personnel Records Center and the Air Force, we were glad
to be able to help obtain 18 medals for this veteran.
If you or a loved one are a veteran having trouble with a VA disability
claim, an issue with receiving service medals, or any other related
problem, please contact my Lexington district office at 859.219.1366.
Caseworkers there are readily available to help you.
I also hope you will consider joining our Sixth District Veterans
Coalition
, which we created to help raise up
matters of concern to the broader veterans community.
Around the District
It was my pleasure to address the 2014 graduates of the University of
Kentucky's Gatton School of Business Friday morning. Congratulations to
all the graduates!
Kentuckians in the Capitol
I was pleased to see the Niemeier and Fox families during their visit
to our Washington, D.C. office. I'm glad you enjoyed your tour of our
nation's Capitol!
Meeting with members of the Kentuckians for Better Transportation
organization was very enjoyable. This organization strives to improve
all transportation modes in the state of Kentucky including maintenance
of highways, waterways and air services. I look forward to working with
this organization on behalf of our Commonwealth as Congress takes on
the funding challenges facing the Highway Trust Fund and a Surface
Transportation Reauthorization this summer.
It was a fantastic visit with members of The American College of
Emergency Physicians (ACEP) this week. I want to thank ACEP for their
support of my bipartisan Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act, and for the
care they provide in our Commonwealth. I look forward to working with
this organization in the future.
I thoroughly enjoyed meeting with members of the Women's Mining
Coalition. A strong mining industry is extremely important to our
nation and to Kentucky. I will continue to fight for coal miners and
their families.
I was glad to speak with Jim Kimbrough representing the AARP
Foundation. We discussed issues facing seniors such as Social Security,
long-term unemployment and Medicare. I will continue to advocate for
the senior citizens of the Bluegrass.
I will continue working to reduce the VA's shameful disability claims
backlog, striving to improve the Department of Veteran Affairs
services, fighting to maintain military retirement benefits,
aggressively helping to improve job opportunities and housing
assistance for veterans, and promoting earned education benefits to
deserving active military and veterans.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find
regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in
Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!
Sincerely,
Andy Barr

Report Dear
Friend,
This
weekend,
it
is
so
incredibly
important
for
us
to
remember
the
true
meaning
of
Memorial
Day
and
honor
the
service
of
those
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for
our
nation.
I
am
so
grateful
for
those
who
have
given
their
lives
for
this
country,
and
for
their
families
who
live
on
with
only
memories
of
their
heroes.
For
all
of
the
families
who
have
lost
a
loved
one
in
service,
I
want
to
thank
you
for
your
sacrifice.
And
for
all
of
the
men
and
women
actively
serving
in
our
armed
forces,
I
am
grateful
for
your
dedication
and
patriotism
today
and
every
day.
I
hope
you
have
a
safe
and
happy
Memorial
Day!

Fighting

our
Veterans
America&#8217;s
freedom
is
only
possible
because
of
the
sacrifice
and
bravery
of
our
veterans.
However,
recent
reports
of
gross
mismanagement
and
falsified
data
records
at
the
VA,
coupled
with
an
utter
lack
of
accountability
at
the
agency,
denies
our
heroes
the
care
they
have
more
than
earned.
This
is
unconscionable
and
completely
unacceptable. That
is
why
this
week,
I
voted
for
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act,
which
would
establish
new
accountability
measures
for
the
VA,
to
help
avoid
further
mistreatment
of
our
veterans.
With
more
veterans
and
service
members
seeking
care
than
ever
before,
the
need
for
higher
standards
is
even
more
clear.
Last
year,
I
began
the
Sixth
District
Veterans
Coalition
as
a
proactive
way
to
help
find
and
enact
solutions
that
will
help
the
vets
who
have
so
bravely
served
our
country.
I
have
been
working
with
the
coalition
to
gather
feedback
from
veterans
across
central
and
eastern
Kentucky
regarding
their
care
and
the
service
at
the
Lexington
VA.
Last
month,
my
office
sent
out
a
survey
and
we
encourage
all
veterans
to
take
it
as
a
way
for
us
to
hear
directly
from
veterans
across
the
district ,
including
those
who
are
in
rural
areas
and
travel
to
Lexington
for
care.
I
also
authored
and
introduced
H.R.
3775,
the
Military
Sexual
Assault
Victims
Empowerment
Act ,
or
the
Military
SAVE
Act,
which
would
empower
survivors
of
military
sexual
trauma
to
select
their
own
care
providers
and
provide
the
support
these
brave
service
members
have
earned.
The
Military
SAVE
Act
could
help
address
the
challenges
facing
the
VA
by
setting
the
precedent
of
providing
these
brave
men
and
women
the
very
freedom
of
individual
choice

and
I

all
veterans
to
fill
the
survey
out
online
or

my
office
with
their

If
you
know
a
veteran
who
would
like
to
fill
out
the
survey,
I
hope
you
will
pass
on
this
information .
I
am
committed
to
ensuring
that
our
veterans
are
not
subjected
to
that
kind
of
shameful
treatment
and
will
continue
to
work
with
the
Coalition
and
the
VA
in
a
partnership
to
promote
and
enact
solutions.

It
was
my

address
the
2014

of
the
University

Gatton

Friday

Congratulations

Kentuckians

Capitol
I
was
pleased
to
see
the
Niemeier
and
Fox
families
during
their
visit
to
our
Washington,
D.C.
office.
I&#8217;m
glad
you
enjoyed
your
tour
of
our
nation&#8217;s
Capitol!
Meeting
with
members
of
the
Kentuckians
for
Better
Transportation
organization
was
very
enjoyable.
This
organization
strives
to
improve
all
transportation
modes
in
the
state
of
Kentucky
including
maintenance
of
highways,
waterways
and
air
services.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
this
organization
on
behalf
of
our
Commonwealth
as
Congress
takes
on
the
funding
challenges
facing
the
Highway
Trust
Fund
and
a
Surface
Transportation
Reauthorization
this
summer.
It
was
a
fantastic
visit
with
members
of
The
American
College
of
Emergency
Physicians
(ACEP)
this
week.
I
want
to
thank
ACEP
for
their
support
of
my
bipartisan
Saving
Lives,
Saving
Costs
Act,
and
for
the
care
they
provide
in
our
Commonwealth.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
this
organization
in
the
future.
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
meeting
with
members
of
the
Women&#8217;s
Mining
Coalition.
A
strong
mining
industry
is
extremely
important
to
our
nation
and
to
Kentucky.
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
coal
miners
and
their
families.
I
was
glad
to
speak
with
Jim
Kimbrough
representing
the
AARP
Foundation.
We
discussed
issues
facing
seniors
such
as
Social
Security,
long-term
unemployment
and
Medicare.
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
the
senior
citizens
of
the
Bluegrass.
I
will
continue
working
to
reduce
the
VA&#8217;s
shameful
disability
claims
backlog,
striving
to
improve
the
Department
of
Veteran
Affairs
services,
fighting
to
maintain
military
retirement
benefits,
aggressively
helping
to
improve
job
opportunities
and
housing
assistance
for
veterans,
and
promoting
earned

benefits
to
deserving

Please
