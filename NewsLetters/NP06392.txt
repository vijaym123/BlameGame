Friend,
Doug Ose is coming at us full force. His outside groups have been attacking Ami with misleading television ads for nearly three weeks straight - and we&#39;re bracing for when Ose uses his vast personal wealth to attack us in the very near future.
So today, we&#39;re fighting back. We&#39;re running our own ad with the truth about Doug Ose&#39;s record. We need to raise $10,000 by Friday to keep this ad on the air for the next week.
Click here and give $5 right now to help us ensure we have the air time we need.
That&#39;s right, we have a new ad going up on the air today. And what Ami told you last week was true - we will need your help, consistently, from now until election day. That includes today - we need you, right now.
Click here to watch our new ad, then give $5 or more to help us keep it running for as long as possible.
Thanks,
Team Bera
PS - Don&#39;t believe the lies - Doug Ose is in this for himself. Last time he was in Congress, he made millions - it&#39;s no wonder he wants to go back!
Watch our ad to get the real story, then donate $5 to help us hit $10,000 by the end of the week in order to keep it on the air.
