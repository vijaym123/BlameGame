David -- Tonight, when the polls close in the Illinois primary, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling will officially become my opponent -- again.
Schilling&rsquo;s candidacy is no surprise, but we must be ready for what&rsquo;s ahead. Last time, our race for Illinois&rsquo; 17th district collectively cost over $13 million! All too much of that was spent on nasty attack ads going after my record.
Look, I know we can win this race. But we have to close the gap against Mr. Schilling and his outside backers. We don&rsquo;t have to match them dollar-for-dollar, but we have to keep it close. David, I&rsquo;m asking you. Will you chip in $8 or whatever you can for our campaign before midnight? It would mean so much to me.
