Congressional Report -- Week of March 31 through April 4: 2,000
CBP Officers Allocated at Ports of Entry in U.S.
Hello Friend,
I spent the week in our nation's capital working on legislation and
attending hearings and meetings - always looking out for the best
interests of the 23rd District of Texas and fellow Texans. It was also
a busy week across the district. Field Representatives visited with
constituents in Dilley, Pearsall, Uvalde, San Antonio, Devine,
Somerset, Cotulla, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Fort Stockton, Alpine, Marfa,
Valentine and Van Horn. Here's a wrap up.

Pearsall High School JROTC Military Ball
Last weekend, I was a guest of honor at the 2014 Pearsall High School
JROTC Military Ball. The ball was held at Randolph Air Force Base in
San Antonio. Getting to meet the students and their instructors was a
great experience. I was impressed with how bright and talented the
cadets are, as well as their instructor's passion for teaching.
Programs like JROTC help young people mature. For more on my attendance
at the military ball, click here

2,000 CBP Officers Allocated at Ports of Entry in U.S.
I was encouraged by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP)
announcement of the allocation of 2,000 additional CBP officers to
further enhance security and improve service levels at ports of entry
across the country. In the 23rd District of Texas, Eagle Pass and El
Paso will receive additional officers at their ports of entry.
This additional allocation will help ease traffic and congestion at
border crossings along the southwest border and move more goods and
people safely in and out of the United States. An increase in the flow
of trade and commerce is good for all of us - and it can be done
without jeopardizing the country's security protocols. For more on
this, click here

$12 Million for Community Health Centers in District
On Friday, I announced more than $12 million in federal grants for
community health centers in San Antonio, Cotulla and Crystal City. The
federal funds are made available through the Department of Health and
Human Services and will help provide quality, affordable health care to
constituents of 23rd District of Texas. For more on the federal grants,

.
23 in 1: Big Lake
I love telling people about the 23rd District of Texas. Recently, I
talked about Big Lake during my regular 23 in 1 series. I use one
minute on the House floor to take viewers and listeners on a quick
journey through the 23rd District of Texas. The speeches take place
while the House is in session and are broadcast on local C-SPAN
channels and on www.c-span.org. To watch the 23 in 1 on Big Lake, click

Tiguas Receive $100K Grant for Diabetes Research and Prevention
A few days ago, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo received $116,971 in federal
grants. The funding will help fight diabetes among local Native
Americans.
Diabetes is a dangerous disease that reduces our life expectancy and
can dramatically change our life style. I will continue to work with
the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, all El Pasoans and all Texans to find ways
to treat, study, control and prevent diabetes in our communities. For
more on this grant, click here
.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
