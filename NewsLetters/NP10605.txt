April 20, 2014
Today, Christy and I join our fellow Christians around the world in celebrating Easter. This holy day is a time to reflect on Jesus' sacrifice for each of us and celebrate the triumph of the Resurrection and His gift of grace. Its a time for renewed hope amidst challenge, and to ponder the common values that unite us -- compassion for all and treating others as we wish to be treated.

Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
