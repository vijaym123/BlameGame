Friend -- The voters still have to decide one Senate race! In Louisiana, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu will be vying to hold her seat on December 6 in a runoff election.
Mary&rsquo;s extreme Tea Party challenger, GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy, would be the next Ted Cruz if he is elected!
He&rsquo;s said the U.S. Senate is &ldquo;run like a plantation&rdquo; and claimed being on Medicaid is &ldquo;actually worse&rdquo; than having no insurance.
Here&rsquo;s the good news: Mary beat him on November 4th, and she can beat him in next month&#39;s runoff! But she needs every single Democrat to stand with her if she&#39;s going to win.
Add your name! Pledge your support for Mary Landrieu in her runoff election. Let&rsquo;s get 100,000 Democrats strong!
