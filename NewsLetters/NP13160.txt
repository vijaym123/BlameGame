Click to Watch: Senator Shaheen spoke on the Senate
floor this week to call for immediate extension of emergency unemployment
insurance.
Dear friend,
This week,
the Senate took an important step toward providing critical emergency
unemployment insurance for thousands of Americans who currently cant
find work through no fault of their own. Democrats and
Republicans came together to do whats right and voted to allow debate on this
legislation. Now I hope we can build off the bipartisan progress we
made this week and actually pass an
extension.
Emergency unemployment insurance is a critical lifeline for families in New
Hampshire who are struggling to find work and we cannot turn our backs
on them now. While New Hampshires unemployment rate is below the
national average, the fact is that if youre out of work, your household is
100 percent unemployed. More than a thousand Granite Staters have
lost this support since the program expired, and that not only hurts
struggling families, but also hurts job creation and economic growth. For
each dollar we spend on extending unemployment insurance, we generate
more than $1.50 in economic growth.
Ive heard from people
throughout New Hampshire who are relying on employment insurance to
support their families and make ends meet while they look for work. For
these families in New Hampshire, for our jobs, and for our economy as
a whole, we have to pass this critical extension. I hope we can do
that next week.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
