Congressman Andrews Announces $3.2M to Create Jobs and Preserve
Affordable Housing in Pennsauken
Camden, NJ-Last Wednesday, Congressman Andrews announced a $3.2 million
grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLB).
According to
the FHLB, the grant will create between 75 to 100 constructions jobs in
South Jersey. The grant, part of the Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act 2013, will pay for
the rehabilitation of a 304-unit affordable housing community in
Pennsauken known as Sycamore Ridge, which is in critical need of
upgrades and repairs to remain a viable and safe option for South
Jersey families to live.
Sycamore Ridge is a garden-style apartment complex containing 18
buildings with 152 one-bedroom apartments, 142 two-bedroom apartments
and 10 three-bedroom apartments.
The property also includes an on-site
management office, community room, central laundry facilities and
outdoor playgrounds.
This project aims to rehabilitate Sycamore Ridge
to a standard of quality high enough to ensure the property remains
safe and meets the needs of families for the next thirty years.
Congressman Andrews stated, "This project will create more construction
jobs in South Jersey and more economic stability for the Pennsauken
community. This grant awarded today will help avoid the loss of this
important affordable housing resource for Pennsauken. I am happy to
support initiatives that are helping to create a safer and happier
environment for the citizens of South New Jersey to raise their
families."
The grant is part of $35.5 million in Affordable Housing Program ("AHP")
subsidies that the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York will award in
2014.
These grants were made possible by the Transportation, Housing
and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013
which Congressman Andrews voted for.
It will help finance 48
affordable housing initiatives which will create or preserve 3,072
units of affordable housing, including more than 2,200 units of very
low-income housing, in New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania.
The 12 Federal
Home Loan Banks have distributed more than $4.8 billion in AHP funds
since 1990.
At the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, the AHP
supported 1,386 projects with nearly $475 million in grants, helping to
create or preserve 60,250 units of affordable housing and generating an
estimated $8.5 billion in total development costs.
