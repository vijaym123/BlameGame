Fellow
Kansan,
As your Representative in the United States Congress, I need your
input to restore accountability to our government. That is why I am
conducting the
2013 Congressional
Issues Survey
in the 3rd Congressional District of
Kansas.
You are one of a select few
Kansans to be chosen as an official representative of your community to
give your opinions in the
2013 Congressional Issues Survey . Your standing in the
community makes your personal input on these questions critical to our
future.
Participating in this survey
will help Washington put people ahead of politics, promote
accountability and personal responsibility, and cooperate to get things done.
Your answers will help me focus on the issues that are really important
to Kansans in the 3rd District. Please take a moment to click the link
and fill out the
2013
Congressional Issues Survey
at your earliest convenience.
