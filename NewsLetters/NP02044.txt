33rd Congressional District Scholarship Roll Call
Dear Friends,
In the next few months, families across the nation will celebrate high school graduates.
Many of those graduates will embark on a new and exciting journey of higher education.
As you may know, the cost of college has increased at an annual pace that exceeds inflation. Over the last decade, in-state tuition at public four-year institutions has risen, on average, 4.2% annually above inflation. For many families here in Texas, the cost of sending a child to school is tone of the most significant financial burdens they face.
For this reason I am enlisting your help in developing the 33 rd
Congressional District Scholarship Roll Call, to list any organization or company that provides scholarship opportunities for college students in or from the Metroplex. This information will be shared with the students attending our
2 nd
Annual Teen Summit on Saturday, April 18, 2015,
and with the residents of the 33 rd
Congressional District to ensure that we provide each child with the opportunity to seek and apply for scholarships they may be qualified to.
To provide my office with information on scholarship opportunities, please send the information to Jimika Allison at
Jimika.Allison@mail.house.gov . Please include:
Name of Company/Foundation, etc.
Name of Scholarship
Award Amount
Scholarship Point of Contact
Brief description of Scholarship Requirements
Website where students can apply for scholarship
Phone number/email for scholarship hotline or point of contact
Should you have any questions, please contact Jimika Allison in my Fort Worth Office at 817-920-9086 or Lorraine Birabil in my Dallas office at 214-741-1387.
Together, we can help break down the barriers for our children to achieve the American Dream.
Sincerely,
Marc Veasey
Member of Congress
