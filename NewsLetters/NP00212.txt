Statement on the Supreme Court Ruling
Regarding Jerusalem
6/10/15
Following the recent ruling in
the Zivotofsky v. Kerry Supreme Court case, Congressman Doug Lamborn
issued the following statement:
"I am deeply disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in
the matter of Zivotofsky v. Kerry. Unfortunately the court followed
arguments put forward by the State Department, arguments that are
political in substance and lack legal
logic.
In an attempt to avoid
political sensitivities the court decision resulted in bad law,
offsetting the balance of powers between Congress and the Administration on
matters of foreign
affairs.
Jerusalem is not Crimea and Israel is
definitely not Russia. I will continue to work in Congress to maintain
Jerusalem as the united capital city of Israel as a Jewish state, and
for the United States recognition of its justified sovereignty over
the
city."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
