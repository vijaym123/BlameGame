Commitment to Veterans
As Veterans Day is upon us,
let us thank those around us who have served in the military for their
service and remember those who paid the ultimate price for our
freedoms. Our nation owes it to these men and women to make certain that they
are given the respect they deserve.
Their benefits were earned
and we owe it to them to provide exceptional
care.
This past year has been tragic for those served by the Department of
Veterans Affairs. The unexplained wait times and poor service for our
vets should be offensive to all Americans.
No cabinet level
budget has been increased more by Congress in the last five years,
making it clear that this is not simply an issue of resources, but rather
the result of systemic failures, poor management, and overall lack of
accountability by the Administration.
We can do
better for those who have fought for our way of life. As your
Congressman, my essential duty is oversight over the Administrations agencies.
It is clear that the VA is in desperate need of change that can only
be undertaken through major legislation. For these reasons, I supported
the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 which
passed both in the House and Senate. This legislation takes major
strides to improve access for Veterans while assuring they receive the best
quality care.

Accountability Act of 2014.
Please rest assured that I
will not falter in my commitment to correct issues at the VA. Hard
work and commitment are needed, but when serving those who have
sacrificed so much for this country it is the least we can
do.
Keeping Our Promise to Veterans
While today is a day to
celebrate veterans, keeping our promise to those who have served is a
year-round commitment.
Here are some examples of
the work my office does for vets:
Throughout the year I host several
job fairs
for
Kansans seeking work. The first hour of each of these
events is open to
veterans only.
I have a
special committee of veterans from Kansas's 3rd Congressional
District
which advises me on all issues having to do with the
military and veterans issues. For example, this year, my veterans
committee advised me regarding potential military action in
Syria.
I have supported legislation and strengthened funding for
Veterans' Drug Courts , which are specialized courts in
our judicial system for those struggling to readjust to civilian life.
They focus on treatment instead of punishment.
I have worked to facilitate Veterans' access to
Washington, D.C. while visiting with
Kansas Honor
Flights.
I have worked across the aisle
to support legislation which facilitates
veteran owned
business , makes their
military training more applicable to
civilian life , and which creates
programs to address
health issues unique to veterans.

Successful
Medicare Open Enrollment Event
I enjoyed meeting many
constituents at my Medicare Open Enrollment Event in Mission last
week.
Thanks to trained
Medicare counselors from SHICK
and the CMS Regional office, seniors
were able to explore the different Medicare options available and make
changes if necessary.
Don't forget you have until Dec. 7 to
enroll or make changes for the coming year. Thanks again to all who
came out to the Sylvester Powell Jr. Community Center and to my event
last month in Wyandotte County. If you have still questions, please call
my office at 913-621-0832.
