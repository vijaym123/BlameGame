My resolution supporting National School Choice Week was passed by the
Senate
on January 21 and it's
been a busy week here in Washington, DC celebrating it. I believe
National School Choice Week provides a great forum to share how school
choice has transformed kids' lives around the country and in South
Carolina. I have seen the incredible power of education firsthand, and
it is absolutely essential that we ensure every student in every zip
code across this nation has access to a quality school.
The School Choice Journey
I started the week at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) talking
about the school choice journey and the positive impacts it has on
families. I've included a link to my remarks and the conversation, to
watch, click HERE
.
Celebrating National School Choice Week on Capitol Hill
Wednesday, I joined Congressman Luke Messer, Chairman of the
Congressional School Choice Caucus, other colleagues from across the
Capitol, and hundreds of students impacted by the chance to go to
better schools, to talk about the importance getting a great education.
These students were inspiring and I believe their future is brighter
because they weren't trapped in a failing school.
CHOICE Act
This week I also introduced my CHOICE Act, a key piece of my
Opportunity Agenda. The CHOICE Act will expand educational
opportunities for children with disabilities, children living on
military bases, and children living in low-income communities. Today,
sadly, not all of our children, through no fault of their own, have
access to a quality education that allows them to reach their full
God-given potential. I believe that it is critical that we work
together to provide every child with a good education and not get
caught up in the politics.
Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Daniel Coats (R-IN), John Cornyn
(R-TX), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), James
Inhofe (R-OK), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Roger
Wicker (R-MS) are cosponsoring my CHOICE Act and working with me on
this important issue.
"Choosing Excellence" School Choice Forum
Lastly, I recently announced my "Choosing Excellence" school choice
forum to be held on February 9 featuring Senate Education Committee
Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rogers
(R-WA), Congressman Messer, former U.S. Secretary of Education Rod
Paige, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Capitol Preparatory Founder and
CEO Steve Perry, Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice President
and CEO Robert Enlow and others.
More information, including how to RSVP, can be found here
. I hope you will consider joining me in
Washington, DC for this important conversation about the future for
every student.
I appreciate the opportunity to serve as your United States Senator.
Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can ever be of
service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

CHOICE

This

I
also
introduced
my

The

will
expand

and
children
living

Today,
sadly,
not
all
of

through
no
fault
of
their
own,
have
access
to
a
quality
education
that
allows
them
to
reach
their
full
God-given
potential.
I
believe
that
it
is
critical
that
we

and
not
get
