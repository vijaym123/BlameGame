Marine Corps 239th Birthday
[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/USMC_logo.svg/432px-USMC_logo.svg.png]
The Continental Marine Corps, the institutional roots of the United States Marine Corps, was established by the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775. With no more than 2,000 enlisted Colonial Marines, the Corps' primary duty was on-board security to protect the Captain of a ship and his officers. The Marine Corps
has since expanded in both its mission and scope, with 194,000 active service Marines (40,000 in reserve) acting as dominant practitioners in amphibious warfare and expeditionary crisis response. Each year, the Marine Corps holds a birthday ball on November 10 to honor the long tradition of Marine service and sacrifice.

NEWSLETTER-MN07: Updates
Dear Friends,
On November 11, I join Americans across the country to honor the dedication and sacrifice of our veterans and their families. Our veterans are continuing to return from service with pressing needs and I am committed to making sure they
have timely access to the benefits they have earned.
Recent failings by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have exposed the challenges veterans can face when seeking care. While Congress has taken steps to address these issues, more can and should be done. I will continue to fight
for meaningful and thoughtful reforms for all our veterans.
In recent years the number of women veterans has grown. Today, women constitute approximately 20 percent of new recruits and almost 280,000 women have served in the military since 9/11. I recently visited the Fargo VA hospital for a
VA Women Veterans Appreciation Day event where I had the opportunity to hear first-hand from these brave women about the unique challenges they face when returning to civilian life. It is important that as this demographic grows Congress provide the Veterans
Administration with the necessary tools to address care for women veterans.
Staff Sergeant Nichoel Lorenz and Sergeant Kristina Wolbeck (MOORHEAD)
Just as our troops vow to leave no one behind on the battlefield, it is our responsibility to leave no veteran behind when they come home. I will continue my work in Congress to serve our veterans as they have served us, making sure
they have the support they need whether it is seeking health care, employment or housing assistance.
Our nation&#8217;s veterans have done everything asked of them with courage and excellence. I honor their service and thank all who
serve.
Sincerely,
[if gte vml 1]>
