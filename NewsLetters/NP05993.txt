The choices you make shape your future. But the choice I&rsquo;m asking you to make in the next 15 hours will affect everyone&rsquo;s future: Do something, or do nothing.
Friend -- The choices you make shape your future.
But the choice I&rsquo;m asking you to make in the next 15 hours will affect everyone&rsquo;s future:
Do something , or do nothing.
I know that doing nothing would be an enormous mistake.
Right now, Democrats are tied or leading in five Southern battlegrounds. I truly believe we can win them and
end
the Republicans&rsquo; takeover chances.
But to win, you need to get off the sidelines and help us aggressively mobilize our voters.
The FEC deadline in 15 hours is the most important we&rsquo;ve ever faced -- that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m pleading with you to click the links below.
Will you pitch in to the Paint the South Blue Program? For just 15 hours, Democratic senators will match your gift 3-to-1.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
With a race this even, winning and losing is decided by which side fights harder right now.
If you don&rsquo;t want Republicans to run this country, you can&rsquo;t wait for someone else to pick up the slack.
I need everyone who believes in our cause to step up now. If you do that, we will win this election and avert a crushing loss in November.
Pitch in before the crucial deadline in 15 hours to stop a Republican Senate takeover. It will be triple matched.
Thank you,
Bill Clinton
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
