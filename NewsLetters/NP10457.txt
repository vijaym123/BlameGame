Friend,
Just wanted to make sure you saw Ami&#39;s email from last week (see below).
When we saw that two of our opponents started running TV and radio ads, it definitely got our attention. April is early by anyone&#39;s standards, and our opponents are already up and running -- so we have to be as well.
Can you help us out and pitch in $5 to our Rapid Response fund? We&#39;re halfway to our goal and we really need to hit this mark.
The longer these ads are on the air, the more misinformation voters will see -- so we need to be able to get the correct information out there.
We have to respond to these ads, and we have to do it rapidly (hence the highly imaginative name of the fund we&#39;ve set up).
Can you pitch in $5 now?
We appreciate the support.
Thanks!
Team Bera
PS - We promise the next thing we link you to will have a far more creative title, but for now - can you chip in $5 to our Rapid Response Fund so that we can rapidly respond? Thank you!

Subject: It&#39;s early for this
Friend,
It&#39;s early in the election year, and I didn&#39;t expect to be writing you this email in mid-April.
My team has just told me that
two of my opponents are already running television and radio ads in our district.
This is happening
much
earlier than we expected, and everyone around here is adamant that we ramp up our fundraising efforts IMMEDIATELY.
We&#39;ve set up a rapid response fund to make sure we&#39;re able to combat these early television and radio ads -- can you pitch in $5 now?
Again, I know it&#39;s really early - but my opponents are already hitting the campaign trail hard, and we must have the ability to do the same.
Can you help us respond today?
Our opponents&#39; TV and radio ads mean they are communicating directly with voters-- and we need to push back.
Click here to give $5 now.
Thanks for your support and for understanding why it&#39;s crucial we take action right now.
Thanks for standing with us.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - It&#39;s only April, and my opponents are already running TV and radio ads in our district.
These attacks are early and can&#39;t go unanswered.
Can you chip in $5 here?
