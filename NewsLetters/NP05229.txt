Friend -- I know you&rsquo;ve been getting absolutely bombarded with emails.
But I&rsquo;m writing again because today is critically important:
Our FINAL two-week-out advertising buy deadline hits tomorrow at midnight!
It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that what you do before then will determine this election&rsquo;s outcome.
Here&rsquo;s where we are:
Six races will decide control of the Senate&hellip; and they&rsquo;re all tied.
Republicans only need to win three to take control.
Those are 50-50 odds -- much too close!
Our final investment must come NOW. It&rsquo;s our LAST CHANCE to buy the ads we need to beat the GOP!
Will you give TODAY so we can break the tie? It&rsquo;s so crucial that we&rsquo;ll match your gift 3-to-1 -- but only until the deadline in 33 hours.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Friend, the race is close, but we can still make sure the GOP suffers what
ABC News
says would be &ldquo;the most crushing failure in recent political history.&rdquo;
But there are a mere 15 days left -- and we MUST make the ad buys that will secure our victory by tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline.
It would be a heartbreaking shame to come so far and then fall short at the last minute.
Instead, let&rsquo;s keep the Senate from the Republicans for the third election in a row!
We need to raise $500,000 by midnight tomorrow -- and we&rsquo;ll triple-match all gifts to get there. Can we do it? Please give now.
Thank you for everything,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
