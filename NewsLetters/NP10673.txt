Good morning -
Every year since 1982, the United States House of Representatives has conducted an art competition for high school students across the nation as a way to highlight the importance of fine arts in schools.
Since its inception, more than 650,000 students have participated.
Winning pieces are displayed in the Cannon Tunnel, a prominent thoroughfare in the U.S. Capitol building, where they are viewed by thousands of visitors each year.
The 2014 Congressional Art Competition is underway, and
I would like to invite all high school students in the Fourth District of Virginia to participate .
Through this competition, one student from Virginias Fourth Congressional District will have the unique opportunity to have their artwork showcased at our Nations Capitol, alongside compositions of other student artists from across the country.
The student whose artwork is chosen to be displayed will also be invited to attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Washington, D.C. in June.
You can read more about the competition on my website at
http://forbes.house.gov/ConstituentServices/artscompetition.htm .
All submissions must be an original concept by the student
All artwork must be two dimensional
All artwork, including the frame, can be no larger than 28 x 28 x 4, and cannot weigh more than 15 pounds
All submissions must be received in either of my district offices by Wednesday, April 23, 2014, in order to be considered.
