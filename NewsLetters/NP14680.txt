Dear ,
Thank you for contacting your Congressional office.
Understanding your ideas and concerns is important to me, as it helps me to better represent you and the Eighth District of Pennsylvania.
I am committed to representing your views and working with other Members of Congress to make a positive impact here in Washington. I have made a note of your comments. If you have a specific issue or policy question, someone will be in contact with you shortly. Due to the large volume of U.S. mail, email and faxes that I receive, response times may vary. If this is an immediate concern please feel free to contact my Washington, D.C. Office at (202) 225-4276 or my Langhorne District Office at (215) 579-8102.
In the meantime, I encourage you to take my short online survey at

On my website you
