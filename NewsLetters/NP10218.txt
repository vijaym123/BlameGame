Dear Friend,
My name is Colleen Coffey, and I&rsquo;m Ed&rsquo;s Finance Director. I&rsquo;m writing today to give you an update on where we stand for the month of April. With only 72 hours until the deadline, here&rsquo;s how things look:
We can reach our goal, but only if we work together.
If every one of Ed&rsquo;s supporters chips in $5, we&rsquo;ll blow past our goal -- click here to contribute.
I know it&rsquo;s easy to think that the election is a long way away. But the truth is, we need to work
every day
at building our grassroots organization if we want Ed to be successful this fall. And to stay on track, we have to hit our goals. Make a contribution of $5, $10, or more right now.
Thanks for your help -- I know Ed appreciates it.
Sincerely,
Colleen
