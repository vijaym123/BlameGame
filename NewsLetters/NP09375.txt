Dear Friends,
This Memorial Day, we honor those Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
We owe these servicemembers and their families a debt of gratitude. May we show our respect by ensuring our veterans have every opportunity and resource they need and deserve. We give thanks to the heroes we have lost and to all of our servicemembers and their families who give so much to keep us safe and free.
Sincerely,
