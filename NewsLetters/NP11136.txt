Dear David Johnson,
My priorities and efforts as your Representative are constantly
shaped by my desire to provide a better America for my two young boys.
In a nation of more than 350 million people, those without a vote are
not often part of the conversation in Washington. I try to look at ways
every day that Congress can improve the safety and quality of life of
our children, immediately and for their long-term future. I want to see
my children grow up in a country that gives every child an opportunity
to be successful, while offering basic health and education
protections.
One way Congress can ensure more opportunities for our children
is to provide universal access to prekindergarten. There is
overwhelming evidence that prekindergarten significantly improves
educational success throughout a child's life. Pre-K is cost effective
and needs to be embraced nationally, not just by those who can afford
it. To assist in this effort, I introduced the Early Childhood
Education Professional Improvement Act, H.R. 3357. My legislation would
provide grants to states to encourage the hiring and education of Pre-K
teachers. It is crucial that all children be afforded a quality Pre-K
education, so they don't fall permanently behind.
To assist our efforts in protecting children, I co-founded the
Congressional Kids Safety Caucus.
This bipartisan Congressional
organization brings much-needed attention to the issue of preventable
child injury, the leading cause of death for children ages 19 years and
younger in the United States. As parents and policy makers, we must
remain focused on protecting the safety of our nation's children. The
Caucus provides a forum for Members to engage in education and
awareness activities that help promote best practices for keeping our
children safe.
As a co-chair of the Congressional Kids Safety Caucus, I try
focusing on problems that are overlooked and to develop legislation
that can help remedy these oversights. Some of the projects I'm working
on are:
Introducing the Infant Formula Protection Act, H.R. 2306,
which would make it illegal to sell expired baby formula. It's
outrageous that stores are permitted to sell this formula. As baby
formula expires it has a higher chance to coagulate, which could kill
or permanently injure an infant.
Improving legislation to end the use of Bisphenol A (BPA), a
toxic chemical used in thousands of consumer products, including food
packaging. If BPA leaks into food it can cause serious health problems
for young children, and is especially problematic for developing
fetuses. BPA exposure during these times may cause wheezing in infants,
late-life reproductive problems, and behavioral problems, according to
a number of studies. In adults, BPA may cause breast cancer and
diabetes.
Crafting legislation to require sunscreen expiration dates on
a bottle's label. After three years sunscreen begins to become
ineffective and should be discarded. Proper labeling will help families
protect themselves and reduce the use of old sunscreen.
Cosponsored the Safe Schools Improvement Act, H.R. 1199, and
the Mental Health in Schools Act, H.R. 628. The Safe Schools
Improvement Act would direct school districts to establish policies
that prevent and prohibit severe bullying and harassment that
interferes with a child's well-being or education. The Mental Health in
Schools Act is widely supported bipartisan legislation that would
create a grant program for schools to work with community-based
organizations. These organizations will train staff to recognize mental
health problems of students and help find solutions.
As I continue to represent you in Congress, I will also be a strong
voice for this nation's children. Our kids can't vote yet, but I'll
fight to be their voice.
Sincerely,
Grace Meng
Member of Congress

Dear

My
