Friends,
Happy New Year! I hope this note finds you well and in the company of
family and friends. Today we have the opportunity to reflect on the
blessings of the past year and upcoming goals and challenges.
As 2013 draws to a close and 2014 begins, I want to express my
gratitude for the honor of serving you and all of South Carolina in the
United States Senate for the past year. It has been a privilege to
represent our great state and I look forward to continuing that work in
the new year.
I hope 2014 is filled with joy, peace, prosperity and good health for
you and your family.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
