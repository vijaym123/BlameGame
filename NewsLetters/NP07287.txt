Dear Fellow Coloradan,
Colorado is home to some of the most important and innovative aerospace operations in the world. The remarkable work done by Colorado's thriving community of scientists, engineers, innovators and entrepreneurs has established our state as an aerospace pioneer and helped our nation remain at the forefront of 21st century ingenuity.
The numbers don't lie: The Centennial State boasts the nation's third-largest aerospace economy and is home to more than 400 companies that support nearly 170,000 Colorado jobs. And each spring, the Colorado-based Space Foundation hosts the annual Space Symposium &mdash; the world's largest gathering of 11,000 space decision-makers from across the globe for a weeklong discussion on the future of aerospace policy.
In fact, Colorado's aerospace operations at private companies, military bases and universities across the state have contributed to new technologies that have improved our lives and our economy. Here are a few ways aerospace innovation in Colorado enriches our daily lives:
The Global Positioning System (GPS):
Operated by the service men and women at Schriever Air Force Base, GPS is not only a critical navigation tool used in cars and cellphones, but it's also essential for aviation safety, computer networking and search-and-rescue missions.
Critical weather forecasting and climate-monitoring technologies:
The Joint Polar Satellite System and the JPSS Common Ground System &mdash; developed by Colorado aerospace leaders Ball Aerospace and Raytheon &mdash; will give advance warning of extreme swings in weather. This, and other weather prediction projects developed in Colorado, help communities and first responders prepare for hurricanes, tornadoes and floods. I was proud to secure funding for the Joint Polar Satellite System &mdash; and several other Colorado aerospace programs &mdash; in the bipartisan budget bill passed earlier this year.
A key component of our national security strategy:
Without the three space-related U.S. Air Force bases &mdash; Buckley, Peterson and Schriever &mdash; and three key military commands &mdash; Air Force Space Command, NORAD and U.S. Northern Command &mdash; headquartered in Colorado, our nation would be much more vulnerable to global threats. As chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, I am keenly aware of the significant role these centers play in keeping us safe, and I will continue to ensure they have the resources necessary to conduct their critical missions.
Intelligence and military space launch:
The vast majority of military and national security satellites rely on technology from Colorado companies like United Launch Alliance to reach orbit. From ground stations to launch vehicles, Colorado's aerospace industry has delivered a matchless record of success and mission assurance for our most critical missions.
Commercial imagery:
DigitalGlobe and the commercial imagery industry continue to thrive in Colorado. Even as the technology improves, commercial imagery remains cost-effective &mdash; and it can serve as a model as the federal government seeks to cut its technology costs in tough budget times. Next week, DigitalGlobe will launch its WorldView-3 remote sensing satellite, built by Colorado's Ball Aerospace and other companies.
Projects to expand the boundaries of human space exploration:
Colorado-based projects, such as Lockheed Martin's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, will take Americans to the moon and beyond. And the Sierra Nevada Dream Chaser spacecraft, currently being developed in Louisville, will make Colorado a key player in transporting Americans to and from the International Space Station.
These exciting developments and essential operations show why we need to keep Colorado at the forefront of aerospace innovation. With Coloradans by my side, I'll continue to work in the U.S. Senate to ensure our state remains an aerospace pioneer, and that our booming aerospace industry continues to grow and support good-paying, 21st century jobs.
Warm regards,
Offices
