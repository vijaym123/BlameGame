Hello,
Social media has become a popular and effective way for residents
and stakeholders of the Eleventh Congressional District of Ohio
(OH-11) to connect with me.
I appreciate the opportunity to share my
votes and opinions on legislation, policies and momentous dates, and
the instant exchange of feedback on the issues.
Each day,
more people use my
Facebook ,
Twitter , and
YouTube
pages to engage in our political process.
To foster this trend, I have launched an Instagram account that I hope
will bolster participation in our democracy.
If you have a
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
YouTube
or
Instagram
account, please
follow me so we can stay connected.
As always, other forms of
communication such as sending me a letter, using my
contact form , or calling my office are still viable ways to
express your concerns to me.
I am sponsoring an online contest, #SeeMyOH11, to
showcase what makes our district the best in the country.
The
challenge is to capture our districts personality, its diversity, or natural
scenery in a photograph.
Constituents will have an opportunity
to vote for their favorites using Facebook and Instagram
likes.
