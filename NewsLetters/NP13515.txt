I wanted to share with you some of what I&rsquo;ve been working on in Tennessee and Washington the past month:
Visiting Fort Campbell for military briefing, Purple Heart ceremony
On Nov. 17, I visited Fort Campbell with Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in advance of the Senate&rsquo;s consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act. During the visit, I participated in a military ceremony at which McCain presented the Purple Heart to Capt. Perry S. Cloud, who was wounded in Afghanistan. We owe a debt of gratitude to him and all those who have worn the uniform of our Armed Services that we couldn&rsquo;t possibly repay, and it was an honor to be reminded of the bravery and sacrifice of our soldiers.

Standing up against Senate &ldquo;obstructionist in chief&rdquo; Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has become the U.S. Senate&rsquo;s &ldquo;obstructionist in chief,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve been standing up against his actions to cut off the right of American voices to be heard on the Senate floor. On Nov. 21, Reid and other Senate Democrats voted for the so-called &ldquo;nuclear option,&rdquo; breaking the Senate&rsquo;s rules so that it takes at most 51 votes to end debate on President Obama&rsquo;s nominees &ndash; instead of 60 &ndash; except in the case of the U.S. Supreme Court. This was the most dangerous change to the rules since Thomas Jefferson first wrote them. And not only did Democrats manufacture a crisis to make this rule change &ndash; Senator Reid is the one who is keeping the Senate from working. He has imposed gag rules to cut off amendments and debate 191 times.

Talking the farm bill and Obamacare with the Tennessee Farm Bureau
I had the opportunity Dec. 9 to speak before the Tennessee Farm Bureau in Franklin at its annual meeting, where I discussed priorities like the farm bill and fighting burdensome regulations &ndash; including Obamacare, the biggest example of regulations by the Obama administration that are increasing costs and reducing choices for Tennesseans. In Tennessee, farmers work on more than 77,000 farms and take care of approximately 10.8 million acres. I discussed the importance of passing a five-year farm bill that cuts spending, modernizes agriculture programs and provides farmers the certainty they need.

Passing legislation to reduce premature births in Tennessee
On Nov. 27, my legislation to reduce preterm birth &ndash; by expanding research, education and intervention activities &ndash; became law. This legislation will help doctors and researchers who are working to save infant lives and prevent premature births.
In Tennessee, the rate of premature births is over 12 percent. We&rsquo;ve made great progress, but premature birth remains the leading killer of newborns and a major cause of lasting disabilities, and this law will ensure there is continued focus on preterm birth and that we make ongoing strides to prevent it.

Discussing education with Knoxville students
Senator Corker and I had the opportunity on Dec. 10 to meet with students from West High School in Knoxville during &ldquo;Tennessee Tuesday,&rdquo; our weekly constituent breakfast. The students are candidates to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, which is a competitive high school program that offers academic courses with high standards.
