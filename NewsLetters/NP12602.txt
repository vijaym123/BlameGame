Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today, the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed the
Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2013 . I was proud to join
Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and Dean Heller
(R-NV) in cosponsoring this important bill, which will give Lake Tahoe,
our treasured Jewel of the Sierras, the continued attention it has
always needed and deserved. Substantial work with stakeholders took place
to craft this bipartisan legislation, and todays Committee vote was
the first step toward it becoming law. I look forward to consideration
of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act by the full Senate.
Thank you for taking the time to read
this email. To learn more about my work on behalf of Lake Tahoe or to

Sincerely,
HARRY REID
U.S.
Senator for Nevada
Benefits of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act
of 2013
Restores Lake Tahoe and the Tahoe
Basin.
The legislation authorizes $243 million
over 10 years for the highest-priority restoration projects based on
scientific data.
The legislation authorizes at least $138
million for storm water management and watershed restoration projects
that are scientifically-determined to be the most effective ways to
improve water clarity.
The legislation also requires a
prioritized ranking of environmental restoration projects and authorizes
$80 million for the Lake Tahoe stakeholders to implement these
priority projects. Implementation of priority projects will improve water
quality, forest health, air quality and fish and wildlife habitat around
Lake Tahoe.
Reduces the threat of wildfire in the
Tahoe Basin.
Authorizes $135 million over 10 years
for hazardous fuels reduction projects to reduce the threat of fire in
the Lake Tahoe Basin.
It also creates incentives for
local communities to have dedicated funding for defensible space
inspections and enforcement.
Protects Lake Tahoe from the
threat of Quagga mussels and other invasive aquatic
species.
The bill provides $30 million for watercraft inspections
and removal of existing invasive species and requires all watercraft be
inspected to prevent the introduction of invasive aquatic species in
accordance with the Lake Tahoe Aquatic Invasive Species Management
Plan.
Supports reintroduction of the Lahontan
Cutthroat Trout.
The legislation authorizes $20 million
over 10 years for the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Recovery Plan. The
Lahontan Cutthroat Trout is an iconic species that has an important historic
legacy in Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is one of the historic 11 lakes that
had Lahontan Cutthroat Trout in the past and is a critical part of
the strategy to recover the species.
Funds scientific
research.
The bill authorizes $30 million over 10
years for scientific programs and research that will produce
information on long-term trends in the Basin and inform the most
cost-effective projects.
Prohibits mining operations in the
Tahoe Basin.
The legislation would prevent the start
of any mining operations in the basin, ensuring the fragile watershed
and Lake Tahoes water clarity are not threatened by pollution from
mining operations.
Increases accountability and
oversight.
All projects funded by this legislation will
have monitoring and assessment in order to determine the most
cost-effective projects and best management practices for future
projects.
The legislation also requires an annual report to Congress
detailing the status of all projects undertaken including project
scope, budget and justification as well as overall expenditures and
accomplishments.
Provides for public outreach and
education.
The legislation requires signage on federally
financed projects in order to improve public awareness of restoration
efforts.
In addition, the bill creates a public
outreach and education program to encourage basin residents and visitors to
implement defensible space to limit wildfire risk; to implement best
management practices for water quality protection; and to take actions
to prevent the introduction and proliferation of invasive
species.
Allows for increased efficiency in the management of
public land.
Under this legislation, the Forest
Service would have increased flexibility to exchange land with state and
local entities allowing for more cost-efficient management of public
land. Currently, the Forest Service manages more than 3,200 urban
parcels spread throughout the Basin.
