Fellow Illinoisans:
At the end of this month, the federal
program that pays for our countrys
major transportation and infrastructure needs
expires. That is just days away.
Without Congressional action, funding to
states and mass transit agencies across the
country will stop. This could seriously
jeopardize projects in Illinois and across
the country.
We have been in this situation before and
managed to authorize an extension without a
lapse. But we shouldnt have to run the
federal highway and transit program like
this.
The longer we wait to address the issue,
the more the cost to repair and replace goes
up. And thats just maintaining what we
have, not investing in what we need.
Illinois Impact
Illinois receives roughly $2 billion in
annual transportation funds from the federal
government of which nearly $600 million is
for transit.
Millions of people in Illinois and across
the country count on these trains and buses
to get to work; to visit family; to run to
the grocery store. This morning alone, 1.5
million Chicagoans took a trip on a Chicago
Transit Authority bus or train during rush
hour.
And its not just in Chicago,
transit ridership is at an all-time high
across our state, but without a long-term
federal investment plan, capacity on
cant even begin to keep up with
demand.
When it comes our roads, highways and
bridges, Illinois is in even worse shape.
Small businesses make up many of the
companies involved in repairing the more than
4,000 bridges that have been deemed
structurally deficient or functionally
obsolete and restoring the roads in poor
condition that have cost Illinoisans$3.7
billion a year in vehicle maintenance each
year
thats $448 per
driver!

Slowing payments to these contractors and
construction workers who are currently fixing
these problems is senseless. This hurts jobs,
both direct and indirect.
Design, construction and maintenance of
transportation infrastructure supports
138,701 full-time jobs in Illinois. These
workers out on the roads and bridges are
middle-class men and women working
labor-intensive jobs to feed their families
and put their kids through school.
They dont deserve this uncertainty
-- not knowing whether or not they will be
paid on time. And they do not need another
manufactured crisis to disrupt their
lives.
Long-Term Investment
Solution
Now the question is not if we should keep
kicking the can down the road, but how far we
kick it. A month? Till September? Till the
end of the year?
The President has proposed a six-year,
$478 billion bill that improves our roads,
public transportation systems and freight and
passenger rail networks.
Under this plan, Illinois would receive an
additional $575 million annually to invest in
repairing and modernizing our
infrastructure.

We cant patch our way to
prosperity. We need a long-term
transportation bill that creates good-paying
jobs by building newer, better infrastructure
that will lay the foundation for a strong
economy.

Dick Durbin
United States Senator
