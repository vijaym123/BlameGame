IRS Investigation Continues Until Truth is
Known
By U.S. Congressman Kevin Brady
The investigation into IRS
abuses continues, despite the politically charged announcement by the
FBI that it doesnt plan to file criminal charges in the corruption case
where the federal tax enforcement agency targeted average Americans
based on their political beliefs.
The FBI announcement was
met with wide public skepticism. So was a hasty investigation this
past summer by interim IRS commissioner Danny Werfel. He declared no
intentional wrongdoing by the agency
and then admitted none of the
principal figures in the scandal had been interviewed. Hes since been
replaced.
To top it off, the person the Justice Department has named to
lead their investigation is a campaign contributor to President Obama and
the Democratic party.
The American people want to know the full truth.
Who at the IRS targeted and harassed conservative groups and their
donors? Who leaked private taxpayer information to the media, special
interest groups and other federal agencies? Who initiated and approved this
abuse of power, and why was it concealed for years from Congress and
the public?

Thankfully the House Ways &amp; Means Committee I serve on is not controlled
by the White House. Our ongoing investigation into IRS abuses is very
much alive. Unlike the others, it wont be a white
wash.
Conducted
jointly with the chief oversight committee in the House, our investigation
quickly proved wrong the original White House claim that the abuses
were conducted by rogue agents in Cincinnati. The targeting started in
Washington, D.C.
Our investigation also discredited White House claims
that liberal groups were targeted. While conservative applications were
selected by IRS officials in the Capitol for extra scrutiny, invasive
questions and endless delays, progressive groups received timely
approval of their tax exempt status. None were harassed.
Since then weve
determined the IRSs targeting of Americans based on their political
beliefs was far more widespread than the agency originally
admitted.
Weve also
uncovered evidence that shows that the IRS subjected conservative
groups to surveillance. And we are questioning why
of the 1,000
violations of taxpayer privacy referred to the Justice Department over the
past three years by the Inspector General
were only a handful
prosecuted?

As of today our investigators have reviewed 380,000
documents, 3,000 tax applications and conducted over 50 interviews with key
IRS personnel. Unfortunately, the Obama administration continues to
withhold critical information our committee has requested
including
all communications from Lois Lerner, a central figure in the
investigation.
Thoroughly and diligently our investigation will get to the truth
wherever the evidence leads us. Well hold those responsible accountable
to the full extent of the law, and ensure this never happens
again.
We
believe
I believe
this matters. The IRS holds the power to destroy
families and businesses. And until recently it was seen as an agency
independent of the White House and political influence. Sadly, thats no
longer true.
During the hearings that revealed the IRS abuses, I asked the
question Is this still America? The full force of the federal
government and the powerful IRS should never be used to silence the voices
of average citizens who simply disagree with their government. Thats
not freedom. Thats not our America.

175th birthday of the Lone Star Flag whose birthplace is Montgomery,
Texas. Dr. Charles B. Stewart lived in Montgomery when he led the
committee appointed by Mirabeau Lamar tasked with designing a flag for the
Republic of Texas. Today, its one of the most recognized flags in the
world, representing a state known for our freedom and
independence.
