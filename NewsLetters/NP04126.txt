Dear Friend,
With Thanksgiving just a few days
away and over two weeks of a
Gratitude Challenge
under my belt, I wanted to take a second and thank you and your
family.
Please know how grateful I am for the chance to
serve Arizona's 6th Congressional District. Don't hesitate to contact me
if you have any questions and concerns.
God Bless
You and Yours.
Sincerely,
