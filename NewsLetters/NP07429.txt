David -- I&rsquo;ll be candid: Cheri's in a tough race -- one of the toughest in the country. Just look at what&rsquo;s happened this summer:
FIRST:
Our opponent, Tea Partier Bobby Schilling, was promoted to the GOP&rsquo;s elite &ldquo;Young Guns&rdquo; list.
THEN:
Speaker Boehner authorized a
$2,224,OOO
assault on Illinois Democrats.
NOW:
Boehner&rsquo;s TOP deputy is raising money to defeat Cheri.
We can fight back -- and win -- but only if we hit each and every goal between now and Election Day. If we don&rsquo;t, Cheri's Democratic campaign could be lost for good. David, will you pitch in $5 or $10 before Thursday&rsquo;s fundraising deadline? David Johnson
