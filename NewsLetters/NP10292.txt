It stands 29 feet tall, mounted on top of a 822-foot-high hill along the coast. For 60 years it has overlooked San Diego and the Pacific, a lasting tribute to the men and women who died fighting for this country. So why is this memorial now at the very center of a heated controversy and legal battle?
The answer is simple. Its because the centerpiece of the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial is a cross.
In 2011, the 9 th
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the cross violates the Establishment Clause because it sits on federal land.
In 2012, the Supreme Court declined to review the case, and in December of last year, a federal district court in California ordered that the cross be removed.
Earlier this month, I supported the signing of a recently filed
amicus
brief
requesting that the Supreme Court review the case and keep the memorial in place.
This case is pivotal because it demonstrates the dangerous trend of silencing of religious expression that we see across our country today. Religious liberty is one of the pillars this great nation was founded upon. On our watch, we will not let that pillar collapse.
Yours in service,
Randy
