Friends,
Leading up to Veterans Day, we have much to be grateful for.
As
someone with two brothers serving in our military, I have seen first
hand the commitment required by the servicemen and women and their
families, and it is truly incredible.
To all who serve and to their
families, a very heartfelt thank you.
Continuing the Veterans Statewide Training Initiatives
In the same vein, my staff and I are working hard to keep the promise
to help our veterans once they return from duty.
After a great first
round of veteran job training workshops last month, we will be hosting
another set of workshops in November focusing on transferring military
skills and certifications to the civilian world.
On November 13, there will be events in Florence and St. Matthews, on
November 18, there will be one in Beaufort, and on Wednesday, November
19, the final November workshop will be in Conway. You can find more
information
here
, and the gold stars on the map below
indicate upcoming events!
Fighting for Education
Education was the force that turned my life around and allowed me to
achieve far more than I ever thought was possible.
My goal is to make
sure that all Americans have access to a great education, no matter
their zip code.
I discussed the importance of access to education on
Morning Joe earlier this week-you can watch below!

It is an incredible honor to represent the people of South Carolina,
and I will continue working on education and other ways to increase
opportunity for South Carolinians and all Americans.
Please do not hesitate to contact my office with questions,
suggestions, concerns if we can ever be of service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
