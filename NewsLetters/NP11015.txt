Dear Friend,
The deadline to enroll in health coverage for 2014 in the Tennessee
Marketplace
is Monday, March 31st - just 3 days from now. Don't miss out on
your chance to get covered! Keep reading to learn how.

Open Health Care Enrollment Closes Monday-Get Covered ASAP!
The open season deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year is
fast approaching on Monday-just 3 days away! Just yesterday, President
Obama announced that the Affordable Care Act's health insurance
marketplaces
reached their nationwide goal of enrolling 6 million Americans.
Reaching this milestone confirms that the Affordable Care Act is
helping deliver high-quality, affordable health coverage to millions of
Americans, but there are still too many uninsured Memphians. With just
3 days left before the HealthCare.gov
open enrollment deadline, it is more important than ever that
uninsured Memphians sign up and get covered right now.
Thanks to the President's landmark Affordable Care Act, many who have
been unable to afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible to
enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
. And, if you do not have health insurance
coverage, you may also be eligible to save money on your health care
premiums
in the Marketplace-but you have to act by Monday to take
advantage of the savings this year.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov
, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901) 528-8341.
You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the Marketplace
Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a
coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans
who needs health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
If you have trouble accessing the website or would like in-person help,
please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800)
318-2596 or schedule an appointment with Seedco Mid-South's Affordable
Care Act "Navigators" by calling (901) 528-8341. If you have any other
questions, you should also feel free to call my office at (901)
544-4131.
Listening to Memphis
On Monday, I hosted another telephone town hall with more than 6,000
Ninth District citizens to answer questions about the issues facing our
district and our nation, including how to ensure that taxpayers take
advantage of all the credits and deductions they are entitled to. We
also discussed my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series of wellness
events as well as my efforts to promote civil rights and protect our
Constitutional right to vote.
Town hall meetings like Monday's give citizens of the Ninth District
like you another way to speak directly with me and share what's really
on your mind. I appreciated having this opportunity to hear your
perspective on important issues and answer your questions regarding the
fast-approaching HealthCare.gov open enrollment
deadline. Regardless of the issue, your opinions and ideas help
me move forward with my work in Congress.
If you would like to sign up to participate in my future telephone town
halls, please email me through my website
with your home phone number. Please enter a
landline phone number, as I cannot call cell phones during telephone
town halls.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Refunds They Deserve
April 15th - the deadline to file your 2013 federal tax return - is
just a few weeks away. As you prepare your return, I hope you won't
overlook the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) if you are eligible for
it. It is an important credit that can give families a financial boost.
But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby County have
not taken full advantage of the program. Last year alone, as much as
$70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by area
taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. This year, I helped open one of 15
new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites that are now operating
throughout Shelby County.
The VITA sites are available to provide tax
return guidance and advice free of charge to ensure that Memphians take
full advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. A list of all VITA locations and their hours is
available here
, and I encourage you to find one near you to help ensure you get
every penny you are owed.
Fighting for the Unemployed
This week, the Senate took a step forward to help extend unemployment
insurance to Americans whose benefits expired at the end of the year
because of Republican obstruction. I'm glad that the legislation is
finally moving in the Senate, but very disappointed that Speaker John
Boehner has indicated that he won't even let the House vote on the
legislation when the Senate sends it to us. I spoke with Ed Schultz on
MSNBC's The Ed Show just a few hours ago to discuss why this
legislation is so important to struggling Memphians. You can watch my
interview here
.
Speaker Boehner shouldn't make millions of out-of-work Americans-
including more than 31,000 Tennesseans-wait another day for the
unemployment benefits they need to keep a roof over their heads and put
food on their tables. He should stop obstructing the Senate's
bipartisan bill and immediately let the House vote to extend this
critical lifeline to people who have lost their jobs through no fault
of their own.
Demanding a Vote on Comprehensive Immigration Reform
On Wednesday, I joined my Democratic colleagues in the House in
demanding that Speaker Boehner allow the House to vote on the
bipartisan immigration reform bill-but the Speaker wouldn't even
consider our request. According to the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office, our bill would reduce the deficit by $200 billion
dollars in just one year and allow those living in the shadows of our
society to pay taxes and more fully contribute to our economy and our
nation.
A majority of the House supports fixing out broken immigration
system, but the Speaker still refuses to bring the bill up for a vote.
You can watch my floor speech here
. I will continue pushing to get a vote
on this important legislation.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
. The deadline to apply for this summer's program is March 31.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding any
property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along to
your friends and family as well!
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the Ninth District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

how
to
ensure
that

Ensuring

Get
the
Tax

Deserve
April
15th
&#8211;
the
deadline
to
file
your
2013
federal
tax
return
&#8211;
is
just
a
few
weeks
away.
As
you
prepare
your
return,
I
hope
you
won&#8217;t
overlook
the
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
if
you
are
eligible
for
it.
It
is
an
important
credit
that
can
give
families
a
financial
boost.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program.
Last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
This

locations
and
their

is

I
encourage
you
to
find
one
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Fighting
for
the
Unemployed
This
week,
the
Senate
took
a
step
forward
to
help
extend
unemployment
insurance
to
Americans
whose
benefits
expired
at
the
end
of
the
year
because
of
Republican
obstruction.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
the
legislation
is
finally
moving
in
the
Senate,
but
very
disappointed
that
Speaker
John
Boehner
has
indicated
that
he
won&#8217;t
even
let
the
House
vote
on
the
legislation
when
the
Senate
sends
it
to
us.
I
spoke
with
Ed
Schultz
on
MSNBC&#8217;s
The
Ed
Show
just
a
few
hours
ago
to
discuss
why
this
legislation
is
so
important
to
struggling
Memphians.
You
can
watch
my
interview
here .
Speaker
Boehner
shouldn&#8217;t
make
millions
of
out-of-work
Americans&#8212;including
more
than
31,000
Tennesseans&#8212;wait
another
day
for
the
unemployment
benefits
they
need
to
keep
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
put
food
on
their
tables.
He
should
stop
obstructing
the
Senate&#8217;s
bipartisan
bill
and
immediately
let
the
House
vote
to
extend
this
critical
lifeline
to
people
who
have
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
Demanding
a
Vote
on
Comprehensive
Immigration
Reform
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
my
Democratic
colleagues
in
the
House
in
demanding
that
Speaker
Boehner
allow
the
House
to
vote
on
the
bipartisan
immigration
reform
bill&#8212;but
the
Speaker
wouldn&#8217;t
even
consider
our
request.
According
to
the
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget
Office,
our
bill
would
reduce
the
deficit
by
$200
billion
dollars
in
just
one
year
and
allow
those
living
in
the
shadows
of
our
society
to
pay
taxes
and
more
fully
contribute
to
our
economy
and
our
nation.
A
majority
of
the
House
supports
fixing
out
broken
immigration
system,
but
the
Speaker
still
refuses
to
bring
the
bill
up
for
a
vote.
You
can
watch
my
floor
speech
here .
I
will
continue
pushing
to
get
a
vote
on
this
important
legislation.

Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
