Listening to
Kansans - Leawood Town Hall Forum
We had a good crowd
Tuesday at Leawood City Hall for my Town Hall Forum. Thank you to everyone
who attended
I appreciate your feedback and advice. We covered a
lot of ground and talked about several important topics for Kansans;
including the budget and deficits, immigration reform, the Affordable
Care Act, growing our economy and creating jobs, the investigation into
Benghazi and more.
Thank you to Leawood Mayor Peggy
Dunn for the kind introduction and having us at City Hall.

Meeting with Military Officers Association of
American - Sunflower Chapter
I was honored to meet with the
Sunflower Chapter of the
Military Officers Association of America
last week. We were
able to discuss several topics that are important to military
veterans and their families. I also spoke about legislation I'm currently
cosponsoring that was written to ensure retired military veterans are
able to receive the full benefits they have earned through their service.
The bill,
H.R.
3790 , would completely repeal the COLA change made by the Ryan-Murray
budget. We must continue to provide needed services and benefits that
our brave military men and women have earned through sacrifice and
service.
I am encouraged by
MOAAs continued support of our active duty force, national defense and
community service initiatives.
Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce
It was a pleasure to sit down with members of the
Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce
last week to discuss several important issues. As
a member of the Appropriations Committee, I gave an update on the
appropriations process, including the recently passed Omnibus bill. This
legislation allowed Congress to prioritize spending while at the same
time represents the fourth straight year in which the federal
government has reduced discretionary spending, the first time this has
happened since just after the Korean War.
I appreciated
taking questions from the audience on many federal issues including taxes,
the importance of focusing on STEM education, working to find
bipartisan solutions and more.

Thank you for the
opportunity to visit with you and discuss these important
topics.
Touring
JCCC Culinary Center
Last week, I toured an outstanding
facility, the new
Culinary
Center
at
Johnson
County Community College

Culinary Apprenticeship
program
is the largest in the country and accredited by the
American Culinary Federation. Thank you to JCCC President Dr. Joe Sopcich and
Hospitality Management Program Director Ona Ashley for your
leadership of this award winning program and for the
tour.
It wasnt too long ago I was on hand for the
groundbreaking, and it was amazing to see the state of the art finished
facility last week. Congratulations on a wonderful building and
program!
Speaking at Leawood Rotary Club
It was a cold
morning last Thursday, but I appreciated the warm welcome from the
Leawood Rotary Club .
As a fellow Rotarian, I enjoyed the chance to update the group on our
recent work in Congress and what we need to tackle in this New
Year.
Thank you to Paul
Rueschhoff for the invitation to speak, and thank you to everyone for your
advice and feedback to me before Congress heads back into session next
week after the District Work Period.
