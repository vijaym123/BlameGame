Hunting Season: A call for public access
Dear David,
It's that special time of year again when hunters are heading out into Montana's wild places to connect with our heritage and bring home some wild game for the freezer.
With general deer and elk season opening on Saturday, it's an opportunity to reflect on what defines our hunting heritage: public access to public lands.
Our state has nearly 30 million acres of public land, but approximately two million of them are locked up.
That's two million acres that belong to you and me, but we can't hunt on them.
That's not right. And it's why I'm fighting to dedicate resources to ensure better public access to our public lands.
It's time we make it a priority to reduce the number of inaccessible acres in our state, opening up those treasured places for everyone to enjoy.
Montana's hunting heritage is part of who we are, our public lands shape our families and our economies.
While we can put a price tag on the jobs and revenue our outdoor industry generates, we cannot place a value on the memories our public lands create.
It's a father and his daughter hiking through the woods quietly waiting for the herd to move in.
It's a mother and her son proudly holding up the elk antlers for a photo.
Those moments are the most important reasons we must keep our public lands public.
So as you head out this opening weekend, be safe, wear your orange, and take a moment to think about the importance of Montana's hunting tradition.
