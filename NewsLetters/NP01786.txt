Dear Friend,
It has been a busy few weeks on
Capitol Hill and in the 3 rd
Congressional District. In
Washington, DC,
I held my first hearing
as the Top
Democrat on the Federal Lands Subcommittee, which oversees the National
Park System, U.S. Forest Service, Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, public
lands and national monuments. During the hearing I questioned the
Director of the National Park Service Jonathan Jarvis about how specific
funding that comes from the National Park Service impacts local
communities and the range of projects that have moved forward thanks to the
Land and Water Conservation Fund.
In Fitchburg, I was the
opening speaker for
Fitchburg State Universitys first
LeaderHERship Conference . The goal of this first conference was to
empower an up-and-coming generation of women leaders to learn the
skills and confidence needed for success in college and beyond. A group of
40 female students were selected through an application process to
participate in this half-day conference.
In this weeks
newsletter you can read about my
meeting with the
President of Afghanistan , Ashraf Ghani; my statement regarding
male sexual assaults in the military ; and a bipartisan
initiative to support
Teaching Health Centers , which I
spearheaded, that became part of the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act that was recently passed by the House of
Representatives.
As always, I look forward to your feedback via my website, or
on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Thank you for staying engaged and enjoy this edition of
Congress in
your Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
