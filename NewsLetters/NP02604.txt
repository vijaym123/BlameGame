Dear Friends,
Spring and summer internships are available in my Washington, D.C. office, and summer internships are available in my Visalia office. If you know someone who is interested
in politics and public affairs, wants to gain professional experience, and can excel in a fast-paced environment, please pass along this message.
Interns provide critical staff support and are often called on to work at public events, conduct research, and help with special projects. The application process is now
open. For spring internships, candidates must submit their applications
immediately ; for summer internships, applications must be submitted by
April 1, 2015 . I accept both part-time and full-time applicants.
All interns must have a high school diploma. Additionally, they must be enrolled in or have recently graduated from an accredited college or university. Applications can
be downloaded from my website
here .
For answers to questions about my intern program, please call (559) 733-3861
or (202) 225-2523.
Sincerely ,
