David --
We need to hear from you.
Our team is putting together research on what issues our supporters want Congress to focus on. But we&rsquo;re missing something -- Your input!
David, don&rsquo;t miss your chance to get your input on record.
Which of the following issues would you like to see Congress tackle right away?
Creating high-quality jobs and growing our economy &gt;&gt; Protecting Medicare and Social Security &gt;&gt; Raising the minimum wage &gt;&gt;
Expanding affordable, high-quality child care &gt;&gt; Promoting equal pay for women and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act &gt;&gt; Standing up for women&rsquo;s access to contraception and critical health care treatments &gt;&gt;
