WATCH Noem introduce the amendment
Dear Friend,
I wanted to briefly touch base with you about new legislation of mine,
which the U.S. House of Representatives passed yesterday.
The
legislation works to better protect the Hot Springs VA Hospital in the
Black Hills and sends a strong message to VA Secretary Eric Shinseki
that South Dakota stands beside its veterans and the Hot Springs VA
Hospital.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a track record of
neglecting historically significant properties, like the one found in
Hot Springs. As you may know, the VA has recently announced it will
move forward with an Environmental Impact Statement - the next step in
their campaign to shut the doors in Hot Springs. My legislation is
simple and straightforward. It protects rural veterans' access to
health care by ensuring no funds go to Environmental Impact Statements,
such as the one they're looking to conduct in South Dakota, in FY2015
that may lead to the closure of critical rural VA hospitals.
Of course, the fight isn't over, but I'm confident this shows that we
aren't ready to give up.

Dear

I
wanted

legislation
works

the
Hot

VA

in
the
Black
Hills
and
sends
a
strong
message
to
VA
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki
that
South
Dakota
stands
beside
its
veterans
and
the
Hot
Springs
VA
Hospital.
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA) has
a
track
record
of
neglecting
historically
significant
properties,
like
the
one
found
in
Hot
Springs. As
you
may
know,
the
VA
has
recently
announced
it
will
move
forward
with
an
Environmental
Impact
Statement
&#8211;
the
next
step
in
their
campaign
to
shut

Hot

legislation
is
simple

protects
rural

of

Of

the
