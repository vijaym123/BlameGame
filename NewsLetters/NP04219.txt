David --
Despite the burden of the most obstructionist and dysfunctional Congress in history&hellip;Despite the challenge of taking office in the midst of the worst financial crisis in 70 years,
President Obama has achieved incredible progress for the United States.
This week, the President announced he would use his Constitutionally granted power to take bold steps to overhaul our nation&rsquo;s broken immigration system. It was a historic move from a historic President.
But Republicans think this is their chance to destroy the President. They&rsquo;re threatening lawsuits, shutdowns, impeachment&hellip;one Republican Congressman even suggested President Obama be thrown in jail!
David, this is critical. The President is under attack and we need to have his back. Will you add your name now and say that you&rsquo;re standing with President Obama in this fight? Sign your name:
