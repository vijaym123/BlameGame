Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
Last week I had the opportunity to meet with small business owners as
we traveled throughout our district. I was incredibly impressed by the
innovative ways these employers are working to reduce costs, increase
efficiency, and remain competitive in an ever-changing global
marketplace.
Government could sure stand to learn from them.
As I've met with small businesses, one of the topics that is raised the
most is the impact that overregulation has on their ability to create
jobs and grow. I experienced these same challenges firsthand when I ran
my own small business for 30 years alongside my brother. When new
regulations in our industry were rumored, proposed or implemented, we'd
have to wait to see what the new compliance costs might be before we
could spend money from our budget elsewhere to update equipment, give
raises, or hire new employees.
While many regulations are vital for a safe and fair marketplace, the
type of excessive regulation we are seeing today has strayed from those
ends and only serves to grow bureaucracy, rather than foster a healthy
economy.
There are currently 174,545 pages of federal regulations on the books
with a cost to the U.S. economy of approximately $1.8 trillion every
year. Despite these figures, by the end of 2013 the Administration had
over 4,000 new regulations coming down the pipeline.
Between this overwhelming burden and the staggering costs of the
President's healthcare law, it's no wonder that the economy is
struggling to recover and that the workforce participation rate is the
lowest it's been in 36 years
.
One of my priorities in Congress is to reverse this trend. I'm working
to find ways to cut red tape and shrink bureaucracy, because we don't
need more government-we need more private sector jobs.
To that end, the House passed bipartisan legislation this week to
reform the regulatory process, and increase accountability and
transparency. H.R. 2804, the All Economic Regulations are Transparent
Act
, would help restore some commonsense to the regulatory
process by increasing transparency and ensuring a more thorough review
of proposed and existing rules, taking their impact on the economy into
greater consideration. By reducing the burden of federal regulation, we
can foster economic growth and create jobs in this country.
I'm committed to working with my colleagues to ensure we have a
government that is accountable to the people, not to the bureaucratic
process, and I will continue to fight to reduce regulation and support
policies that help get people back to work.
Please do not hesitate to contact me with your thoughts and ideas, or
if I can be of any assistance.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It

Tipton Statement on Vote Against raising the debt ceiling: Congressman
Scott Tipton issued this statement following the vote in the House on a
clean raise of the debt ceiling. Tipton voted against the measure. "The
$17.3 trillion national debt didn't happen overnight. It will take a
long time and a lot of work to dig our nation out, and we won't be able
to do that if we continue business as usual in Washington.
Unfortunately, that's all that the President and Congressional
Democrats will accept-more of the spend-now-think-later status quo that
got us here." Read more
Grand Junction Sentinel Editorial: Legislature makes it clear feds
shouldn't grab water: U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton, whose district includes
most of western Colorado, has introduced a bipartisan Water Rights
Protection Act in Congress supported by more than 30 state, local and
national stakeholder groups, including the National Cattleman's
Association and numerous Colorado counties, river districts and
conservation groups. And Congress clearly does have the authority to
direct how federal agencies may act. The bill cleared the U.S. House
Committee on Natural Resources and awaits a debate by the full House.
The bill "would protect communities, businesses, recreation
opportunities, farmers and ranchers, as well as other individuals that
rely on privately-held water rights for their livelihood from federal
takings," Tipton said on his website, and it would clear up the issue

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
Last
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
small
business
owners
as
we
traveled
throughout
our
district.
I
was
incredibly
impressed
by
the
innovative
ways
these
employers
are
working
to
reduce
costs,
increase
efficiency,
and
remain
competitive
in
an
ever-changing
global
marketplace.
Government
could
sure
stand
to
learn
from
them.
As
I&#8217;ve
met
with
small
businesses,
one
of
the
topics
that
is
raised
the
most
is
the
impact
that
overregulation
has
on
their
ability
to
create
jobs
and
grow.
I
experienced
these
same
challenges
firsthand
when
I
ran
my
own
small
business
for
30
years
alongside
my
brother.
When
new
regulations
in
our
industry
were
rumored,
proposed
or
implemented,
we&#8217;d
have
to
wait
to
see
what
the
new
compliance
costs
might
be
before
we
could
spend
money
from
our
budget
elsewhere
to
update
equipment,
give
raises,
or
hire
new
employees.
While
many
regulations
are
vital
for
a
safe
and
fair
marketplace,
the
type
of
excessive
regulation
we
are
seeing
today
has
strayed
from
those
ends
and
only
serves
to
grow
bureaucracy,
rather
than
foster
a
healthy
economy.
There
are
currently
174,545
pages
of
federal
regulations
on
the
books
with
a
cost
to
the
U.S.
economy
of
approximately
$1.8
trillion
every
year.
Despite
these
figures,
by
the
end
of
2013
the
Administration
had
over
4,000
new
regulations
coming
down
the
pipeline.
Between
this
overwhelming
burden
and
the
staggering
costs
of
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law,
it&#8217;s
no
wonder
that
the
economy
is
struggling
to
recover
and
that
the
workforce
participation
rate
is
the
lowest
it&#8217;s
been
in
36
years .
One
of
my
priorities
in
Congress
is
to
reverse
this
trend.
I&#8217;m
working
to
find
ways
to
cut
red
tape
and
shrink
bureaucracy,
because
we
don&#8217;t
need
more
government&#8212;we
need
more
private
sector
jobs.
To
that
end,
the
House
passed
bipartisan
legislation
this
week
to
reform
the
regulatory
process,
and
increase
accountability
and
transparency.
H.R.
2804,
the
All
Economic
Regulations
are
Transparent
Act ,
would
help
restore
some
commonsense
to
the
regulatory
process
by
increasing
transparency
and
ensuring
a
more
thorough
review
of
proposed
and
existing
rules,
taking
their
impact
on
the
economy
into
greater
consideration.
By
reducing
the
burden
of
federal
regulation,
we
can
foster
economic
growth
and
create
jobs
in
this
country.
I&#8217;m
committed
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
ensure
we
have
a
government
that
is
accountable
to
the
people,
not
to
the
bureaucratic
process,
and
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
reduce
regulation
and
support
policies
that
help
get
people
back
to
work.
Please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
with
your
thoughts
and
ideas,
or
if
I
can
be
of
any
assistance.
