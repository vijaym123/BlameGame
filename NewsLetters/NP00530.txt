Fighting the EPA for Our Farmers
Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a moment to tell you about recent legislation we
passed in the House that can have a great impact on our famers at home
in the 5th District.
A group of young farmers and ranchers from various places throughout
Louisiana visited my office in March to make sure I knew the issues
they face daily as they set about running their farms and ranches.
Some talked about crop insurance. Others voiced their support for
opening up new markets on which they can sell their commodities. But
the one issue that had everyone anxious was overreach from the
Environmental Protection Agency, or more specifically, the Waters of
the U.S. (WOTUS) proposed rule.
These young farmers are not alone in their concern. In fact, nearly
every agricultural or waterway organization I meet with all but begs
Congress to repeal the WOTUS rule because of the burdensome regulations
it imposes on not only water usage, but also land usage.
Farmers, I have good news: Congress has heard you. On May 13, the House
of Representatives passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act to
withdraw the proposed WOTUS rule. As the only member of the Louisiana
delegation on the House Agriculture Committee, I was proud to cosponsor
and vote for this legislation and once again serve as a strong voice
for our states farmers.
WOTUS is about control. The EPA wants to regulate a puddle because that
puddle water might run into a ditch, that then it might run into a
stream, that then might run into river. Such strict control over a
farmers land and water is crippling to the proper flow of business and
it infringes upon landowners rights.
I side with farmers they are the best conservationists on the planet.
Farmers make their living off of the land, so theyd never do anything
to harm it. Besides, its utterly ridiculous to think the federal
government knows a tract of land better than the farmer who works it
every day.
WOTUS became like so many other policies that are indicative of this
administration: Its a top-down, we know better than you, do as we
say mentality. The bill the House passed changes that.
This bill withdraws the WOTUS rule. It requires the EPA and the Army
Corps of Engineers to develop a new rule to define navigable waters of
the U.S. This should prevent over regulation of water and curb abuse of
the program. This bill takes real steps toward curtailing the overreach
of the EPA. Under this act, the EPA must act in accordance with the
limits set by Congress and the Supreme Court to ensure that the rights
of landowners are not violated.
Perhaps most importantly, this bill requires that the new rule be
constructed with consultation from local officials, stakeholders and
other interested parties. Those who will be most affected by any new
rules will have the largest hand in crafting any new policy, and the
EPA will have to publish a public report to prove it is working with
locals throughout the process.
The Houses action on this bill is encouraging, but were only a part
of the way through the process. Ill continue to monitor this
legislation as it makes its way through the Senate. Hopefully, my
colleagues in the other chamber will also recognize how important this
legislation is to farmers and landowners and how it protects them from
federal overreach.
The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act is a win for Louisianas
farmers. With that under our belts, we can look toward other policy to
help Louisianas farmers, such as expanding markets, promoting trade
policies that are favorable to the United States and protecting farmers
from foreign market manipulations.
As the representative of one of the largest row crop districts in the
nation, it is my honor to go to bat every day for farmers in the 5th
District. Know that I will tackle these agricultural issues as
aggressively as I worked to remove the proposed WOTUS rule.
Sincerely,
Ralph Abraham

About
Fighting
the
EPA
for
Our
Farmers
Dear
Friend,
I
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
tell
you
about
recent
legislation
we
passed
in
the
House
that
can
have
a
great
impact
on
our
famers
at
home
in
the
5th
District.
A
group
of
young
farmers
and
ranchers
from
various
places
throughout
Louisiana
visited
my
office
in
March
to
make
sure
I
knew
the
issues
they
face
daily
as
they
set
about
running
their
farms
and
ranches.
Some
talked
about
crop
insurance.
Others
voiced
their
support
for
opening
up
new
markets
on
which
they
can
sell
their
commodities.
But
the
one
issue
that
had
everyone
anxious
was
overreach
from
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
or
more
specifically,
the
Waters
of
the
U.S.
(WOTUS)
proposed
rule.
These
young
farmers
are
not
alone
in
their
concern.
In
fact,
nearly
every
agricultural
or
waterway
organization
I
meet
with
all
but
begs
Congress
to
repeal
the
WOTUS
rule
because
of
the
burdensome
regulations
it
imposes
on
not
only
water
usage,
but
also
land
usage.
Farmers,
I
have
good
news:
Congress
has
heard
you.
On
May
13,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Regulatory
Integrity
Protection
Act
to
withdraw
the
proposed
WOTUS
rule.
As
the
only
member
of
the
Louisiana
delegation
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee,
I
was
proud
to
cosponsor
and
vote
for
this
legislation
and
once
again
serve
as
a
strong
voice
for
our
state&#146;s
farmers.
WOTUS
is
about
control.
The
EPA
wants
to
regulate
a
puddle
because
that
puddle
water
might
run
into
a
ditch,
that
then
it
might
run
into
a
stream,
that
then
might
run
into
river.
Such
strict
control
over
a
farmer&#146;s
land
and
water
is
crippling
to
the
proper
flow
of
business
and
it
infringes
upon
landowners&#146;
rights.
I
side
with
farmers
they
are
the
best
conservationists
on
the
planet.
Farmers
make
their
living
off
of
the
land,
so
they&#146;d
never
do
anything
to
harm
it.
Besides,
it&#146;s
utterly
ridiculous
to
think
the
federal
government
knows
a
tract
of
land
better
than
the
farmer
who
works
it
every
day.
WOTUS
became
like
so
many
other
policies
that
are
indicative
of
this
administration:
It&#146;s
a
top-down,
&#147;we
know
better
than
you,
do
as
we
say&#148;
mentality.
The
bill
the
House
passed
changes
that.
This
bill
withdraws
the
WOTUS
rule.
It
requires
the
EPA
and
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
to
develop
a
new
rule
to
define
navigable
waters
of
the
U.S.
This
should
prevent
over
regulation
of
water
and
curb
abuse
of
the
program.
This
bill
takes
real
steps
toward
curtailing
the
overreach
of
the
EPA.
Under
this
act,
the
EPA
must
act
in
accordance
with
the
limits
set
by
Congress
and
the
Supreme
Court
to
ensure
that
the
rights
of
landowners
are
not
violated.
Perhaps
most
importantly,
this
bill
requires
that
the
new
rule
be
constructed
with
consultation
from
local
officials,
stakeholders
and
other
interested
parties.
Those
who
will
be
most
affected
by
any
new
rules
will
have
the
largest
hand
in
crafting
any
new
policy,
and
the
EPA
will
have
to
publish
a
public
report
to
prove
it
is
working
with
locals
throughout
the
process.
The
House&#146;s
action
on
this
bill
is
encouraging,
but
we&#146;re
only
a
part
of
the
way
through
the
process.
I&#146;ll
continue
to
monitor
this
legislation
as
it
makes
its
way
through
the
Senate.
Hopefully,
my
colleagues
in
the
other
chamber
will
also
recognize
how
important
this
legislation
is
to
farmers
and
landowners
and
how
it
protects
them
from
federal
overreach.
The
Regulatory
Integrity
Protection
Act
is
a
win
for
Louisiana&#146;s
farmers.
With
that
under
our
belts,
we
can
look
toward
other
policy
to
help
Louisiana&#146;s
farmers,
such
as
expanding
markets,
promoting
trade
policies
that
are
favorable
to
the
United
States
and
protecting
farmers
from
foreign
market
manipulations.
As
the
representative
of
one
of
the
largest
row
crop
districts
in
the
nation,
it
is
my
honor
to
go
to
bat
every
day
for
farmers
in
the
5 th
District.
Know
that
I
will
tackle
these
agricultural
issues
as
aggressively
as
I
worked
to
remove
the
proposed
WOTUS
rule.
