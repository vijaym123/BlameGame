ISSUES
Made-In-Maine, Free-Market Solutions to
ObamaCare :
On Monday, Congressman Poliquin wrote to Chairmen Paul
Ryan (R-WI), Fred Upton (R-MI) and John Kline (R-MN) expressing his
concerns with ObamaCare and offering free-market solutions to the
Presidents health care law.
"Government should work FOR our families
and the businesses that employ them, NOT AGAINST them. Solving our
country's health insurance problem will give our families more financial
security and peace of mind.
OnProcess Technology
Expanding to Belfast : On Monday, Congressman Bruce
Poliquin announced that OnProcess Technology will be expanding their
business to Belfast and will begin hiring
immediately.
Im thrilled
to welcome OnProcess Technology to our Great State of Maine,
said Congressman Poliquin. They have made an excellent decision in
expanding their business in Maine and hiring Mainers as we are the hardest
working people in the country. OnProcess Technologys expansion will
have a profound impact on the Belfast community and it is great to see
that Maine is open for business.
Poliquin Supports Federal Reserve
Subpoena : Congressman Poliquin supports the subpoena
issued yesterday by the House Financial Services Committee, on which
he sits, to the U.S. Federal Reserve. America's central bank has
refused to provide the Committee responsible for its oversight with
documentation regarding the leak of market-sensitive inside information to an
outside private entity.
"I am very concerned about our nation's
central bank seemingly resistant to turn over important documents to
this oversight Committee that would help determine who and how
confidential inside information was unlawfully released to an outside party.
Such a breach could have given one group of investors an unfair and
illegal advantage over the general public regarding their stock and bond
investments."
