VA Secretary Will Testify Before My Subcommittee Tomorrow
Dear Friend:
I&rsquo;m honored to serve as the Chairman of the House Appropriations Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. My Subcommittee is responsible for providing funding for all military construction projects &ndash; such as housing and infrastructure on our bases &ndash; and also for funding the Department of Veterans Affairs.
I know that many of you are concerned about the services provided by the Department of Veteran&rsquo;s Affairs (VA), particularly the VA health care system. Tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM, the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
the Honorable Robert A. McDonald, will be appearing before my subcommittee.
You can watch his testimony and the hearing by using this website:
