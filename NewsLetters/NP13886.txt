A Minute with Mike - November Newsletter
Dear Friend,
This holiday season, as we give thanks for the blessings we enjoy, it
is important to remember those who have less and the challenges they
face. As the son of San Jose strawberry sharecroppers, I am thankful to
live in a country that provided me the opportunity to work hard and
achieve my dreams, first as an educator, and then in a career dedicated
to public service. I will always be an advocate for people of all
backgrounds who are marginalized in our society, working to give them a
chance to succeed.
I am pleased to announce a new way for you to connect with me. I
continually benefit from hearing the stories and concerns of my
constituents. As a Change.Org Decision Maker
, I can now respond to petitions
constituents have signed. Click here
and here
to see a few of my responses.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda

Enhancing Social Security
Hosting my Social Security town hall.
I was proud to host a town hall this month to discuss how we can
strengthen and preserve our nation's commitment to Social Security and
Medicare. The bipartisan, bicameral budget conference committee has
been charged with reconciling two different budget visions, and there
is a very real threat that they could include cuts to Social Security,
Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' programs, and other core programs in a
conference agreement.
I believe that our goal as policymakers should instead be to strengthen
programs that bolster the middle class, not chip away at our values in
the name of austerity. This must be the center of Democratic efforts.
Programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid serve to hold
together an ever-widening income gap that will only grow under the
weight of austerity measures and sequester cuts. The notion that we can
achieve a balanced budget through entitlement cuts and proposals like
chained CPI, which will reduce benefits that seniors have earned,
should strike fair-minded Americans as an absurd and cowardly way to
approach our problems.
We must look forward to find new opportunities, and achieve the real
victories that are possible, because too much is at stake to do
otherwise. America's working families depend on it.

Opening a Silicon Valley branch of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
After a concerted, multi-year effort to locate a satellite office of
the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in Silicon
Valley, I am pleased to announce that we have succeeded! I am joined by
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Anna G. Eshoo and Rep. Zoe Lofgren in
celebrating the selection of San Jose's City Hall building as the
permanent location for the Silicon Valley satellite patent office. The
USPTO announcement comes after a search for a permanent office space
was put on hold in July due to federal budget sequestration.
As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the
Commerce Department, I have worked for months with the committee
chairman, Patent Office officials, and the South Bay delegation on a
solution that will allow the innovation of our region to continue to
thrive, and I was so pleased when Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker
called to discuss this decision. Going forward, I will be redoubling my
efforts to end the budget sequestration that threatens the USPTO and
all fee-based agencies once and for all, which you can read more about
here. My priorities in representing Silicon Valley will always remain
in job growth and cultivating innovation.

Covered California
If you haven't had the opportunity to do so yet, please visit Covered
California to learn more about the new California-run health insurance
exchange. Covered CA is at the forefront of healthcare reform,
implementing the Affordable Care Act to expand access to healthcare for
all Californians. Already, young people can stay on their parents
insurance until age 26, insurance coverage can't be denied based on
pre-existing conditions, and low-income Americans have expanded access
to life-saving healthcare choices. Visit CoveredCA
today to learn more.

Typhoon Haiyan Relief
As the Philippines slowly rebuilds in the wake of the tragic and
devastating Super Typhoon Haiyan, I am continuing to advocate for
important relief and recovery efforts. I have met with officials from
the State Department, USAID, and the DOD to discuss the role our nation
can play in these recovery efforts, and I am proud to say that we were
the first foreign government on the ground to assist the Filipino
people. Alongside my colleague Rep. Jackie Speier, I introduced H. Res.
408 to express the condolences of the American people and to reaffirm
the long-standing partnership and friendship between our two nations.
As I continue my work, I ask you to please consider what you can do to
help by visiting www.USAID.gov
today.

Iran Nuclear Deal
The Iran nuclear deal marks a significant first step - the first in a
decade - toward curbing Iran's nuclear capability and strengthening
global peace and security. In the first phases of this agreement, Iran
must verify rollback of its nuclear program and demonstrate that it
cannot build a nuclear weapon - in exchange for limited, reversible
sanctions relief.
We must be resolute in holding Iran to this agreement and ensure this
is the first of many steps towards the safety of Israel and a lasting
peace in the Middle East.

The Employment Non-Discrimination Act
As vice chair of the Equality Caucus, I am proud to announce another
milestone in the fight for equal rights for our ??LGBTQ? brothers and
sisters: the Senate has passed ?the Employment Non-Discrimination Act?!
I call upon my colleagues in the House to join me in passing this
legislation, for which I have been an advocate throughout my career in
Congress. It is up to us to ?pass ENDA? and end workplace
discrimination.??????
