Who Else Thinks Gas Prices Are Too High?
Dear Friends,
When President Obama took office, Americans paid, on average, $1.84 for
a gallon of gasoline. Today, that number has climbed to an unacceptable
$3.68 with no sign of relief in sight. All the while, President Obama
has blocked commonsense initiatives like the Keystone XL Pipeline that
would help increase American energy supplies. You deserve better.
Exorbitant prices like these hurt hardworking families in our district.
Tennesseans still have to drive their kids to school and commute to
work when gas prices go up-there is little that they can do to offset
these costs at home. But, with willing partners in the Senate, Congress
can take action to ease this burden on Americans by getting Washington
out of the way of domestic energy exploration. That is why, this week,
I voted for H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gas Prices to Fuel an America that
Works Act.
When it comes to increasing our energy supply here at home, President
Obama is asleep at the wheel. On his watch, over 87 percent of our
nation's offshore acreage is off limits to oil and natural gas
exploration. The President is also keeping a tight grip on oil-rich
public lands to appease his liberal base. In fact, his offshore leasing
plan over the next five years includes NO new areas available for lease
to drill for oil, offering the lowest number of lease sales in history
. Our
legislation fights back by increasing both offshore and onshore energy
production, reducing bureaucratic red tape, and unlocking vast energy
resources the Obama Administration has kept out of production-in turn
helping to offer relief at the gas pump.
This bill earned the support of a bipartisan majority in the House of
Representatives because it offers something that Americans can agree
on. In addition to increasing energy production to lower fuel costs,
this bill will generate over $1 billion in new revenue and, according
to one independent estimate, could create up to 1.2 million long-term
jobs.
Tennessee families should never have to choose between buying groceries
and filling up their gas tank. H.R. 4899 will help ensure more
affordable fuel costs for ALL Americans. I am proud to support this
legislation and urge my Senate colleagues to follow the House's lead by
passing this measure without delay.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress

Who
Else
Thinks
Gas
Prices
Are
Too
High?
Dear
Friends,
When
President
Obama
took
office,
Americans
paid,
on
average,
$1.84
for
a
gallon
of
gasoline.
Today,
that
number
has
climbed
to
an
unacceptable
$3.68
with
no
sign
of
relief
in
sight.
All
the
while,
President
Obama
has
blocked
commonsense
initiatives
like
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
that
would
help
increase
American
energy
supplies.
You
deserve
better.
Exorbitant
prices
like
these
hurt
hardworking
families
in
our
district.
Tennesseans
still
have
to
drive
their
kids
to
school
and
commute
to
work
when
gas
prices
go
up&#8212;there
is
little
that
they
can
do
to
offset
these
costs
at
home.
But,
with
willing
partners
in
the
Senate,
Congress
can
take
action
to
ease
this
burden
on
Americans
by
getting
Washington
out
of
the
way
of
domestic
energy
exploration.
That
is
why,
this
week,
I
voted
for
H.R.
4899,
the
Lowering
Gas
Prices
to
Fuel
an
America
that
Works
Act.
When
it
comes
to
increasing
our
energy
supply
here
at
home,
President
Obama
is
asleep
at
the

On
his
watch,
over
87
percent
of
our
nation&#8217;s
offshore
acreage
is
off

to

natural
gas

The
President
is
also
keeping
a
tight
grip
on
oil-rich
public
lands
to
appease
his
liberal
base.
In
fact,
his
offshore
leasing
plan
over
the
next
five
years
includes
NO
new
areas
available
for
lease
to
drill
for
oil,
offering
the
lowest
number
of
lease
sales
in
history .
Our

fights
back
by
increasing
both
offshore
and
onshore

This

earned
the
support
of
a
bipartisan
majority
in
the
House
of

because
it
offers
something
that

In
addition
to
increasing
energy
production
to
lower

this
bill
will
generate
over
$1
billion
in
new
revenue
and,
according
to
one
independent
estimate,
could
create
up
to
1.2
million
long-term
jobs.
Tennessee
families
should
never

H.R.
