In 2009, two organizations representing the heads of state education departments and the nations governors developed the Common Core State Standards to provide consistent learning goals across states for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level.
Currently, all but seven states
Virginia, Alaska, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and Indiana
have adopted the Common Core State Standards for mathematics and English.
As an incentive, states that implement the standards have an increased chance of receiving federal grant money.
The goal of the academic benchmark is a focus on comprehension and critical thinking; however,
critics
believe that tying tests to these standards will actually harm this goal because teachers will teach to the tests rather than working to ensure their students receive a well-rounded education.
