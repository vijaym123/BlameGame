A Thanksgiving Message From Kelly Ayotte
Dear Friends,
This is a special time of year set aside to count our many blessings.
We have so much to be thankful for: our family and friends; our faith; and our cherished freedoms. We're truly blessed to live in the greatest nation on Earth.
As we gather around the table on Thanksgiving, let's call to mind our brave servicemen and women who are deployed overseas. We hold them in our hearts always - and pray for their safe return.
As we all know, Thanksgiving weekend marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season. This Saturday is "Small Business Saturday" - a reminder of the important role that small businesses play in our communities. As you make plans to head out to the stores, don't forget our local Main Street shops across New Hampshire.
In my hometown of Nashua, my family is looking forward to the Holiday Stroll on Saturday night - an annual tradition. It's a great opportunity to celebrate all that downtown Nashua has to offer. I hope you'll take the opportunity this holiday season to support our downtown merchants.
Again, from my home to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. I hope you enjoy a safe and happy holiday.
Warm Regards,
Kelly Ayotte
United States Senator
