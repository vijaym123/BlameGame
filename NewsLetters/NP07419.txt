This morning, Tammy Duckworth asked you to support Cheri. Well, your response has been nothing short of... SENSATIONAL!!! As of 7pm, we&rsquo;re on the verge of reaching
3OO
online donations for Cheri JUST in the last 24 hours!
If we can do it, it&rsquo;ll be a
MAJOR
victory for us -- and a
HUGE
setback for Boehner. David, are you in?
