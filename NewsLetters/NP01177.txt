Dear Friend,
Wildfire season is here, which means it's more important than ever for each of us to do our part to protect our communities from unintended fires.
Learning about wildfire danger and being prepared can help reduce the threat of fires to our natural surroundings, our homes, and our businesses. Please take a moment to watch this short video with tips to help your family prepare for wildfire season.
As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources committee, I'm working to reform federal wildfire policy, such as increasing resources to restore New Mexico's national forests to healthy conditions in order to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
I'm also a co-sponsor of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which would treat the largest fires--roughly one percent of annual fires--as natural disasters, and fund firefighting efforts from a disaster account similar to the one that funds hurricane and other natural disaster relief efforts.
For more safety tips, best practices, and active wildfire information please visit the
Wildfire Preparedness &amp; Prevention Resource Center
on my website.
It is an honor and privilege to serve you in the United States Senate. If you need
help with a federal agency
or would like to
share your thoughts
with me please do not hesitate to
contact
my office.
Sincerely,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
