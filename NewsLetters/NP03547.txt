Dear David,
This week we're ringing in a new year, new Congress, and most importantly, a renewed focus on the issues impacting you and your family.
As I've said since joining the U.S. Senate, some of the best ideas for what to tackle come directly from constituents, and that's why I'm asking for your help. I want to know what you believe Congress should focus on this year.
Click here to take a quick (it will only take a minute) survey.
Your input will serve as a valuable tool for me as I continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to tackle the issues facing our country.
I'm here to fight for all Missourians, and I appreciate you taking the time to tell me what's important to you and your family. Take this brief survey and let me know what issues you think Congress should focus on this year.
All the best,
P.S. Stay up-to-date on my work for Missouri by
