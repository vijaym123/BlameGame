Congressman
Lamborn Joins Call Expressing Concern About Iran's Nuclear
Program
10/3/14
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined 353
of his fellow Members of Congress in sending a letter to Secretary of
State John Kerry expressing serious concern about Irans refusal
to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
The text of the
letter
follows:
October 1, 2014
The Honorable John F. Kerry
Secretary
U.S.
Department of State
2201 C
Street, NW
Washington, DC
20520
Dear Mr.
Secretary:
As the United States prepares for the resumption of
negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran to achieve a comprehensive nuclear
agreement, we remain deeply concerned with Irans refusal to fully
cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
As you know,
the IAEA has sought information on the potential military dimensions
of the Iranian nuclear program, in particular information about
Irans extensive research and development of a nuclear explosive
device.
For
several years, the IAEA has attempted to work with Iran to resolve this
central issue, but Tehran has refused.
Last November, the IAEA
and Iran concluded a Framework for Cooperation in which Iran agreed
to work with the IAEA, including by providing satisfactory information
in response to IAEA inquiries within mutually agreed deadlines.
Nevertheless, in its September 5, 2014 report, the IAEA stated that
Iran had failed to meet its latest deadline, even as it continued to
demolish structures and construct others at the Parchin military base,
where clandestine nuclear-related activities have reportedly taken
place.
We
believe that Irans willingness to fully reveal all aspects of its
nuclear program is a fundamental test of Irans intention to uphold a
comprehensive agreement.
As you wrote in the Washington Post
earlier this summer, if Irans nuclear program is truly peaceful, its not
a hard proposition to prove. The only reasonable conclusion for its
stonewalling of international investigators is that Tehran does indeed
have much to
hide.
We are concerned that an agreement that accepts Irans
lack of transparency on this key issue would set the dangerous
precedent that certain facilities and aspects of Irans nuclear program can
be declared off limits by Tehran, resulting in additional wide-ranging
restrictions on IAEA inspectors, and making effective verification
virtually
impossible.
A resolution of this issue is also essential to
establishing a baseline regarding the status of the Iranian nuclear program.
Accurate predictions of the period of time needed by Iran to
assemble a weapon and assessments of Irans compliance cannot be made
without highly reliable information obtained from an unrestricted
inspection and verification regime.
Such a baseline is also critical
to developing more precise estimates on the time it would take Iran to
develop a nuclear weapons capability without
detection.
We would like to
achieve a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis.
As
negotiations resume, we urge you to carefully monitor Irans
cooperation with the IAEAs inquiry.
As you have written, there is a
discrepancybetween Irans professed intent with respect to its nuclear
program and the actual content of that program to date.
We agree
with your assessment that these issues cannot be dismissed; they must
be addressed by the Iranians if a comprehensive solution is to be
reached.
An agreement that effectively prevents Iran from
acquiring a nuclear weapons capability demands transparency on the extensive
research and development work that Iran has undertaken in the
past.
