Dear
Friends,
As spring moves into
Delaware, it brings with it
more than just April showers
and May flowers.
Unfortunately, the warmer
weather can also bring
natural disasters like
tornadoes, floods, and
hurricanes with it.
That is why it is so
important that your community
be always prepared for any
type of disaster.
This month, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
and Ready.gov are teaming up
for Americas
PrepareAthon!,
anationwide,
community-based campaign to
increase emergency
preparedness and
resilience. All month,
communities across the
country will be using
resources provided by
Americas PrepareAthon!
to get ready for a disaster
via exercises, drills, and
trainings. All of this
preparation leads up to the
first biannual National Day
of Action on April 30
th , which will
focus on taking actions to
prepare for four common
disasters associated with
springtime and warmer
weather: floods, hurricanes,
wildfires, and tornadoes.
I encourage you and your
community to join
Americas PrepareAthon!
by registering your school,
business, place of worship,
or other group so you can
empower yourself and your
peers with the knowledge and
skills needed to respond
during a disaster. To
register, simply visit
www.ready.gov/prepare
and join the over 700,000
other Americans who have
pledged to increase their
communitys disaster
resilience.
I look forward to hearing
from you on this, or any
other topic, through
email
or by contacting me on
