Dear Friend:
In the wake of the tragic shootings in Isla Vista near the University of California, Santa Barbara last week, I announced today that I will be introducing legislation soon to help provide families and close associates of a potentially dangerous person with new options to help prevent gun violence.
The Pause for Safety Act
will include the following provisions:
One, it would help ensure that families and others can go to court and seek a gun violence prevention order to temporarily stop someone close to them who poses a danger to themselves or others from purchasing a firearm.
Two, it would help ensure that families and others can also seek a gun violence prevention warrant that would allow law enforcement to take temporary possession of firearms that have already been purchased if a court determines that the individual poses a threat to themselves or others.
Three, it would help ensure that law enforcement makes full use of all existing gun registries when assessing a tip, warning or request from a concerned family member or other close associate.
It is haunting that the family of the gunman who committed this massacre in Isla Vista was desperate to stop a tragedy, and yet they lacked the tools to do so. My bill would give families and associates who fear someone close to them could commit violence new tools to help prevent these tragedies.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
