This Memorial Day Weekend...
Dear Friends,
As we enjoy time with family and friends this Memorial Day, let us remember those who gave their lives so that we may be free.
I hope you will take a moment to watch this video honoring and thanking our veterans and their families throughout Central and Southwestern Illinois for their service.

If you're a veteran and need help with the VA, my office can help.
Please contact my staff at any one of the district offices listed below or

We are here to serve you.
Happy Memorial Day!
Forward to a Friend
