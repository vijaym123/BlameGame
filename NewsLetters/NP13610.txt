Dear Friends:
As 2013 comes to a close and you're preparing to spend Christmas with family and friends, I wanted to share with you some of the accomplishments we've had for the 12th District. It's been a year of tremendous obstacles, but despite them all we've had some significant victories.
For example, my office helped the people of the 12th District get back more than $2.2 million they were owed from their own government.
Whether you're having problems with the Social Security Administration, getting your veteran's benefits from the VA, or dealing with any other federal agency, we're here to help. Sometimes it can be hard to deal with bureaucrats, but we've gotten pretty good at cutting through the red tape to get you what you're owed.
In addition to helping folks with these issues, I wanted to share with you some other numbers:
34: The number of Congress on the Corner town hall meetings I held in the district this year.
17: Thats the number of counties I visited on my Rural Listening Farm Tour.
19: Thats how many counties we visited during our Public Safety Tour.
2:
That's the number of
job fairs we held in Augusta and Statesboro.
In addition to these events, we fought to
save the Georgia Regents ROTC Program .
And we passed legislation in the House to make responsible cuts in federal spending,
without
furloughing civilian employees at the Department of Defense .
Its been a busy year, and Im looking forward to 2014.
If youre having a problem, or just want to ask a question, my staff and I
are just a phone call away.
Or you can stop by during office hours
we have them in all 19 counties of the 12 th
District .
You can even call us toll-free at (866) 890-6236.
In the meantime, I hope you and your family have a Merry Christmas next week.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
