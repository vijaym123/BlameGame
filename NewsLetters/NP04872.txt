CRITICAL DEADLINE: 11:59PM PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BOTH ASKED FOR YOUR HELP.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you if we didn&rsquo;t need your help.
A new Fox News poll shows the race for Congress is a dead-heat
UPDATE : Late last night, Boehner piled in MORE attack ads to tip 2 must-win races to the Republicans
We&rsquo;re basically out of time to respond --
our FINAL monthly fundraising deadline is in less than 2 hours
That&rsquo;s a crushing combo of bad news.
But here&rsquo;s the good news:
Until midnight tonight, we&rsquo;ll be able to triple-match donations!
David, poll after poll shows we can pull off shocking upsets on Election Day. We can&rsquo;t let this opportunity slip away now. Can you donate right now while your gift is still Triple-Matched?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
DCCC
