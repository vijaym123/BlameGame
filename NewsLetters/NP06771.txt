Human resources are the key to a prosperous economy in the Northern Mariana Islands. No one understands that better than the members of the NMI Chapter of the Society of Human Resource Managers. I spoke at the group's lunch on Thursday, detailing the work I have done in Congress to make sure we have a workforce that is healthy, well-nourished, and educated. I asked for their help in making sure our local workers get jobs. Thank you to SHRM for the opportunity to address your membership and for the lively discussion that followed.
Public input sought on new workforce training law - Following on enactment of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the U.S. departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services are seeking public comment on how to implement the new law. The departments are hosting a series of interactive webinars, each on a specific class of persons that WOIA aims to help. The September 2nd webinar is focused on Individuals with Disabilities, the September 5th event on Disconnected Youth. Find the complete schedule of programs at http://www.doleta.gov/wioa/. WOIA is a replacement of the familiar Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and came out of the House Education and the Workforce Committee of which I am a member. Over the next six years the new law will increase funding for some training programs in the Northern Marianas by 17 percent, and shift more decision-making authority to state-level officials.

Northern Marianas College is one of the hundreds of schools and training programs nationwide listed in the updated GI Bill Comparison Tool . The Tool estimates the financial assistance those eligible for the post-9/11 GI Bill can receive at each educational institution. 60 vets are already using their GI Bill benefits at NMC.
VA announces improvements to GI Bill benefits calculator - Veterans, who want a quick look at education benefits they have earned, should check out the new and improved, online GI Bill Comparison Tool . The updated version went live this week, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced. The Tool estimates the tuition, book stipend, and housing allowance a veteran or service member eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill can expect to receive while attending universities, colleges, community colleges, and vocational trainings nationwide. The tool also provides useful information on programs offered, graduation rates, and other details about the schools themselves. For a more complete catalog of 9/11 GI Bill benefits go here . And, remember, if you feel you are not getting what you earned in service to your country, you can always contact your congressional office for assistance at: : kilili@mail.house.gov .

$100,000 awarded for NMI economic development planning - The U.S. Economic Development Administration has announced the award of $100,000 to the Commonwealth Government to support the update of its comprehensive economic development strategy. CEDS plans are a necessary precondition for getting grants from EDA. Public and private stakeholders appointed by the Governor set priorities and draw up the development roadmap, which is then used to guide investment. Based on the CNMI CEDS, EDA invested $750,000 in 2008 for waterline replacement on Saipan and $1.5 million in 2011 for 1 million gallon water tank. Previous plans were adopted in 1997, 2003, and most recently in 2010. This new $100,000 planning grant is made possible through the Economic Adjustment Assistance program approved by Congress in Public Law 113-76 .
Public Health Officers can continue to serve in NMI - The issue of whether the Commonwealth Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality and the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation can continue to benefit from the technical expertise of officers of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Services has been resolved in favor of the CNMI. Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak, Acting Surgeon General of the United States, and Environmental Protection Agency Region IX Administrator, Jared Blumenfeld, informed me this week
that the legal authority allowing assignment of these officers to our islands was no longer in question. I had told the Surgeon General and EPA Administrator that I was ready to work for a change in the law, if necessary, after receiving word of the problem from CUC Executive Director Alan Fletcher in June. Utility and environmental agency managers in American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Marianas had been dealing with the problem
since 2011, when the number of officers began to be cut back. But Congressional attention can sometimes help to bring issues to conclusion.

Should FAS citizens in the NMI register for the draft? - Citizens of the Freely Associated States, who live in the Northern Marianas, occasionally ask the congressional office whether they are required to register with the Selective Service System. The answer is yes, but the Selective Service website has been unclear on this. So, we asked for definitive guidance. As a result, SSS has updated its website with a better explanation:
Habitual residence is presumed and registration is required whenever a national or a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau, resides in the United States for more than one year in any status, except as a student who entered the U.S. for the purpose of full time studies as long as such person maintains that status or employee of the government of his homeland.
Here is the link to the complete chart of "Who Must Register" .

NOAA lists 2 NMI corals as threatened - Out of 66 corals, proposed for listing as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act last November, only two found in Northern Marianas waters will receive that federally protected status. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Wednesday
that the species Acropora globiceps and Pavona diffluens would be designated as threatened. CNMI law already protects all species of corals
and generally prohibits the collection or removal of any corals from our waters. The new designation could result in more federal help in protecting our corals from coastal pollution, and from the rising ocean temperatures, acidification, and disease associated with global climate change. In addition to their cultural significance corals have economic value. A 2006 study calculated that Saipan's coral reefs are worth $42 million annually
as breeding areas important for subsistence and commercial fisheries, for storm protection, and because of their value to our tourism industry.
