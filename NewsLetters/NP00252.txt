LOCAL COMPANIES
NEED ACCESS TO FREE
AND
FAIR
TRADE
Many friends and neighbors have called this week to ask how I
planned to vote on Trade Promotion Authority, also known as "Fast
Track" or "TPA."
Contrary to reports that TPA was
"secret," the full legislation has been available online since May
1st.
Click here to read the
bill.
Today, I voted "yes," and here's
why.
In order to grow an opportunity economy and create
good-paying jobs, local companies need access to free and fair
trade.
We must enable them to engage the global market and not lose by
default to
China.
With today's vote on TPA:
Congress has
given President Obama 150 clear guidelines for negotiating trade
agreements.
By providing those objectives upfront, we
streamline the process and make it easier to negotiate good trade deals
that provide more jobs for hardworking American
families.
Congressional oversight is strengthened with several measures that go
far beyond our current authority.
Every President
has had some form of Trade Promotion Authority since 1974.
The
newest version of TPA gives Congress unprecedented access to the
negotiating process, including the right to attend previously-secret
negotiating sessions.
Today's legislation also requires a
public, 60-day review period prior to a Congressional vote on new trade
agreements.
Congress makes the laws.
Only
Congress can approve a trade agreement, and we can strip President Obama of
this trade authority if he fails to follow the guidelines we've put
in place.

Authority or today's vote, you are welcome to call my office at 202-225-1976

Restoring Fiscal Sanity:
Appropriations Bill Cuts
$661 Million from President's
Request
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed
H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, and Science
Appropriations bill . This bill is the funding vehicle for the Department
of Commerce, Department of Justice, National Science Foundation, NASA
and other related agencies.
The bill
responsibly funds counterintelligence programs, federal law enforcement, and
crucial science programs , while reducing funding for
non-critical programs and mandating stringent oversight to ensure Washington is
efficiently using the taxes of hard working
Americans.
Giving priority towards counterterrorism and counterintelligence programs,
cybercrime prevention, and human trafficking victims, we were able to
target our resources in the most efficient manner possible,
saving $661 million from the Presidents funding
request .
The CJS Appropriations bill also focuses resources on federal
law enforcement activities and creates a new Community Trust Initiative
to improve the safety of local communities by supporting police
training.
Furthermore, the bill helps create an opportunity economy. By
funding programs like the National Science Foundation and National
Institute of Standards and Technology for advanced research on manufacturing,
cybersecurity, and STEM education, we are fostering U.S. economic
competitiveness.
Tomorrows good-paying jobs will come from
education and innovation, making investment in those areas crucial to our
economic success.
The final
CJS Appropriations bill
passed the U.S. House of
Representatives with my support in a bipartisan vote of 242-183 on June 3,
2015.
