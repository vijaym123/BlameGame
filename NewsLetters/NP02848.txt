Email Privacy Act
On Wednesday, I
introduced
HR 699
the Email Privacy
Act
with 229 original cosponsors, which is more than
a majority of the entire House of
Representatives.
Click here to read
Roll Call' s coverage of the bill
introduction.
Right now, the
federal government is using an arcane 1986 law to conduct warrantless
searches of the personal email accounts and other digital
communication of the American people. The last time Congress updated our email
privacy laws, we were two years removed from the release of the first
Macintosh computer. Its time Congress modernized these outdated
statutes to ensure that the rights protected by the Fourth Amendment extend
to Americans email correspondence and digital
storage.
Click here to read
National Journal 's coverage of
the bill introduction.
My
bill would:
1) Update the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
to improve
privacy protections for electronic communications stored or maintained
by a third-party service
provider.
2) Affirm that Americans have reasonable expectation of privacy in
their email accounts and other personal and professional content
stored online.
3) Require the
government to get a search warrant based on a showing of probable cause in
order to compel a service provider to disclose communications that are
not readily accessible to the public-- regardless of the age of the
communications, the means of their storage, or the providers access to or
use of the communications in its normal business
operations.
4) Preserve the legal tools necessary to
conduct criminal investigations and protect the public. Nothing in the
bill alters warrant requirements under the Wiretap Act, FISA, or any
other law.

House Votes to Repeal the ACA
Last week, the House of Representatives passed
HR 596
a bill to fully repeal the
Affordable Care Act , otherwise known as Obamacare. This hastily
passed and poorly implemented law has acted like a wet blanket,
smothering our economy since 2010. Right now, small businesses are paying
close to $11,000 per employee to comply with federal regulations and
Obamacare alone is expected to lower employee wages by $22.6 billion per
year.
This law isn't working. That is why I voted for this
important first step towards advancing health care solutions that
Americans want and need by doing away with this job killer. In the
future, the House will consider legislation to replace Obamacare with
patient-centered, free market-oriented health care reform.
Congressman Alan Nunnelee Passes Away at 56
C lick
here to read about Congressman Nunnelee's passing, his battle with brain
cancer, and his work in Washington over the last four
years.
On Friday morning, I was deeply saddened to learn of my
dear friend from Mississippi, Congressman Alan Nunnelees passing. Alan
and I came in to Congress together in 2010 and he and his wife Tori
were some of the first people Brooke and I met at freshman orientation. I
greatly enjoyed both the wisdom and wit he displayed every day with
his deep southern accent while we served together on the Appropriations
Committee over the last four years. As his family noted, he was well
loved and will be greatly missed. My prayers and condolences go out to
his wife Tori and three children as they mourn his
loss.
Celebrating Black History Month
February
marks Black History Month, when we honor the accomplishments of
African-Americans throughout our history. It was first celebrated as a full
month in 1976, when President Gerald Ford directed the US government
to recognize the month as a part of the United States bicentennial.
Since 1926, the celebration had been limited to the second week in
February, as both President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass'
birthdays coincided with that week and had been celebrated within
African-American communities since the late 1800s.
Response to
President's Budget Proposal
C ongressman Yoder addresses President Obama's FY15 Budget Proposal on the
House floor.
Last Tuesday, I took to the House floor
to discuss President Obama's 2015 Budget Proposal that was released
on Monday. While I appreciate the President bringing forth his vision
for our country, it is neither one the American people can afford nor
one that I can support.
House Votes to Curb Federal
Mandates
Last week, the House of Representatives passed
HR 50
the Unfunded
Mandates Information and Transparency Act , which requires
federal agencies to consult those who would be impacted by federal
regulations before implementing them. This is yet another commonsense
solution put forth by the new Republican-led Congress to improve
transparency and hold the government accountable to the American
people.

Victims

Fox News ' coverage
of the Army's announcement.
As a cosponsor of the
Honoring the Fort Hood Heroes
Act
in the last Congress, I was pleased to hear on
Friday that the US Army has decided to move forward and present Purple
Hearts to the victims of the Ft. Hood massacre. This is an important honor
and distinction for the victims and their families.
Meeting with Johnson County Mental Health Association
Congressman Yoder with prevention
coordinators Jamie Katz (left) and Megan Clark (right).
I was
pleased to meet with Jamie and Megan, two prevention coordinators from
the Johnson County Mental Health Association last week. We discussed
the ongoing work with prevention centers and the need for promoting
better mental health training for law enforcement officers and health care
workers.
Meeting with National Rural Health
Association
Congressman Yoder with
the Kansas members of the National Rural Health
Association.
I was also glad to meet with the Kansas members of the National
Rural Health Association. We discussed the challenges facing health
care in rural Kansas, including the impact of doctor
shortages.
