Rep. Lipinski Thanks
Vietnam Veterans During Ceremony in Lemont
Congressman Dan Lipinski was the keynote speaker at Saturdays Vietnam
Veterans Day Ceremony in Lemont at VFW Post 5819.
You can read his
entire speech by clicking

"Thank
you for serving our country when we called you, especially at a time
it was not popular to heed the call. Like your fathers before you, you
put your dreams on hold for our nation.
Before answering Uncle
Sams call, many of you probably had never traveled out of the country,
maybe not your state.
You were sent to Vietnam, a place
somewhere on the other side of the world.
And most troubling,
you were sent for a reason that many Americans questioned," said Rep.
Lipinski.
"But you answered the call to
serve, and I thank you, even if many people were
ungrateful.
Most of you deserved much better when you came home, a lot
better.
There were no parades.
Instead of a Thank You some
people may have sworn at you or worse. You were not treated like the
heroes you are, but you
persevered."

Olympian from

Congressman Dan Lipinski recently honored U.S.
Olympian Kendall Coyne during a special ceremony involving area students

Palos Heights.
A forward for the U.S. Womens Hockey Team,

he made honoring her in the United States House of Representatives
and a flag that flew over the Capitol.

I am pleased that an individual such as Kendall was able to
represent the Third Congressional District, the state of Illinois, and
the nation during the most recent Olympic Games, stated Rep.
Lipinski.
She showed young girls and boys across the world what it means
to work hard as a leader and a member of a team.
I know her
future will continue to be full of success, both on and off the
ice.

Theres a lot of attention these days on a few young people
that make bad decisions, Rep. Lipinski said.
I look forward to
this long standing program every year because it gives me the
opportunity to highlight a group of well-rounded young men and women that the

Looking at these individuals

them
I know they will make great contributions to their communities
