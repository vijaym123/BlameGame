Statement on Supreme Court Decision on
Marriage
10/6/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn issued the following
statement after the Supreme Court denied without comment several cases
involving a states right to define
marriage:
"I am extremely disappointed
in the Supreme Courts decision to not hear appeals from five states on
the right to define marriage within a states borders. There is
nothing in our Constitution that prohibits a state from retaining the
time-honored definition of marriage as a union between one man and one
woman.
By refusing to take up these appeals, the Supreme Court has
allowed unelected activist judges from lower federal courts to usurp
the democratic process and undermine the constitutional rights of
several states, including Colorado, to define marriage consistent with the
values of their citizens.
The definition of marriage
should not be left to unelected and unaccountable judges, but rather
should be decided by the people of each state. This is why I am a
cosponsor of the State Marriage Defense Act, a bill that respects the
definition of marriage held by the people of each state and protects
states from the federal governments efforts to force any other
definition upon them. I will continue to work hard to see this important
legislation passed into
law."
