Dear Fellow Coloradan,
The upcoming Colorado Capital Conference in Washington, D.C., is an opportunity for you and others from across Colorado to meet and engage with national leaders and key opinion leaders in our nation's capital. I am again hosting this year's conference with Colorado Mesa University and the University of Colorado. This year, 100 Coloradans with diverse political viewpoints will have the opportunity to join this conference in Washington, D.C., June 17-19, to learn how to effectively engage with and influence leaders in Washington.
Last year, I was proud to host the
third annual Colorado Capital Conference in Washington, D.C.
With a variety of speakers like U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, Senator John McCain, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, and Charlie Cook, editor and publisher of the Cook Political Report, the conference was an opportunity for citizens from communities across the Centennial State to hear directly from decision makers and reporters in Washington and offer our uniquely Western perspective.
As with every year, I encourage Coloradans from all political viewpoints and backgrounds to
apply to take part
in this unique experience.

Government is a two-way street. Your point of view matters as we work to shape policy, and it's important to me to provide Coloradans with some of the tools they need to more effectively work with our federal government.
The Colorado Capital Conference is a chance to learn about the political process, hear directly from national leaders, interact with other civic-minded Coloradans and take home ideas about how you can affect political change.

Applications must be submitted online or postmarked by April 1, 2014. We will be announcing attendees on April 17, 2014.
Warm regards,
