Despite what you may hear in the political rhetoric of Washington, the Affordable Care Act is working. Last year, millions of Americans nationwide enrolled in a private health insurance plan during open enrollment or gained coverage through Medicaid and the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program. In Illinois, thousands more people now have health insurance, some for the first time in their lives, because of the Affordable Care Act.
The bill also provides $11 billion in funding for the operation, expansion, and construction of community health centers. Much of this money funds the creation of new health centers for communities in need and expands the capacity at existing centers. By 2015, health centers will have doubled their 2010 capacity to 40 million patients. That&rsquo;s a success any way you slice it.
U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) discusses how to sign up for health care coverage during this year's enrollment period.
The past weekend marked the beginning of the second open enrollment period for health insurance. For year two, Illinois consumers will have more choices. The number of plans offered on the marketplace will increase from 165 to 400 and more plans mean more competition and in many cases lower costs for families.
Uninsured residents must enroll in a plan by December 15th to have their coverage start on January 1, 2015. So if your family, friends or neighbors need affordable coverage, tell them to go to getcoveredillinois.gov and sign up. They can also call 1-(866) 311-1119 to get started.
