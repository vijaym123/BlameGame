Speaker Boehner just made a stunning prediction:
&ldquo;Illinois is probably going to have the best Republican year [in 2 decades]."
Boehner thinks with enough cash, he can mask his right-wing agenda and defeat strong Illinois Democrats like Brad Schneider.
Well, I&rsquo;ve got a message for him: Illinois&rsquo;s a Democratic state --
a progressive state
-- and we&rsquo;re going to fight to keep it that way.
David, if you agree, chip in a few dollars to Brad&rsquo;s campaign and help him fight back against the onslaught of Republican attacks. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s targeting Brad because his race is one of the most competitive in the entire country.
The only thing standing in the way of a Republican victory is your support.
