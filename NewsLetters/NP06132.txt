Dear
Friend,
Today, September 20, marks the one year anniversary of the House
passage of H.R. 1526, the
Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy
Communities Act .
This bipartisan bill will help revitalize
the timber industry throughout Montana and create thousands of good,
long-term jobs.
It cuts the red tape that has held up
responsible forest management and timber production.
It
tackles beetle kill, protecting our environment for future generations and
reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires. And it restores the
federal governments commitment to our rural communities
providing 25
percent of timber sales receipts to timber
counties.
Because of these reforms, this legislation has gained strong support from
folks across Montana
from county commissioners and firefighters, to
mill workers, sportsmen and teachers.
As a
fifth-generation Montanan and a lifelong sportsman, I know Montanans are passionate
about forest health because they want to preserve our beautiful
landscape so future generations can enjoy it for years to
come.
Thats why I support the
Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy
Communities Act
and I call on the Senate to also act on
comprehensive forest management reform that revitalizes our timber industry and
protects the health of all of our National
Forests.
Because as most Montanans know, the responsible and active management of
our National Forests is critical for the health of Montanas economy, as
well as the health of our forests themselves.
As always, please don't hesitate to
contact my office
if you have any concerns, questions, or ideas
to share with
me.
Thanks,
Steve Daines
