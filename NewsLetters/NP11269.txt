Friends,
As
Representative of North Carolinas eighth congressional district, I
have the privilege of nominating young men and women to four of the
five service academies. Just last week, it was my honor to call a student
from Hickory Grove Christian High School to give her the great news
that she was accepted into the United States Naval Academy. Midshipmen
like this young woman, and all men and women in uniform, make
incredible sacrifices to defend our freedoms.
Just as these patriots
pledge to uphold their commitment to serve our country, we owe it to them
to uphold our commitment to care for them during and after their
service.
As a country, we must never take for granted the
sacrifice of our active duty military men and women and veterans.
As
your Congressman, I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that
these heroes are treated with the dignity and respect they
deserve.
This past week, I was fortunate to spend time traveling the
district to see our military priorities and strength first-hand and visit
with veterans across North Carolina.
Our state is privileged
to be home to over 700,000 proud veterans, and I am proud to represent
a district that has a strong military presence.
I was so
impressed by the operations at North Carolina Air National Guard Base at
Charlotte Douglas International Airport and the airmen I met who stand
ready to protect our community, our great state, and our nation. These
units are equipped to provide assistance to our communities during
national or state emergencies and stand combat-ready for immediate
mobilization if needed during wartime. Our community can rest assured
knowing that the 145th Airlift Wing of NCANG is always prepared to
serve.
I was
also fortunate to embark on a tour of the operations at Camp Mackall,
an active U.S. Army training facility located in the heart of our
district. Most North Carolinians recognize Fort Bragg as the epicenter of
the universe and home of our states biggest military training
facility.
The soldiers and airmen and women at Fort Bragg are the
tip of the spear that guarantees our national and domestic security, and
facilities at Fort Bragg and at Camp Mackall provide vital training
to our U.S. Army Special Forces.
These special operators have
proven the efficacy of their tactics time and time again over the past
decade and it is critically important that we continue to support
in-depth training and maintain their access to new
resources.
I also had the
distinct pleasure to learn about our VA health care facilities and
meet with our retired servicemen and women.
The W. G. (Bill) Hefner
VA Medical Center in Salisbury serves nearly 300,000 of our veterans
with the needed support and health care for their physical and
psychological wounds. The work done at this facility to take care of those
who have served is essential, and
I look forward to continuing
the conversation to ensure the needs of our servicemen and women
continue to be
met.
I convened a meeting of my 8th District Veterans
Advisory Committee in Rockingham to visit with veterans and hear their
top concerns and most pressing needs. The Veterans Advisory Committee
is made up of one veteran representing each of the veteran auxiliary
organizations in the eighth district as well as the Veteran Service
Officer in each of the 12 counties in our district. One of the top
concerns I heard was the frustration with the time it takes to process
disability claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
The
backlog that currently plagues the VA is deplorable, and I am working to
address this serious issue.
Last week I authored a
letter to the Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, urging
appropriators to include language that holds the VAs senior leadership
responsible for the backlog of
claims.
This commonsense language
will directly tie the rate of compensation for the Secretary and Members
of the Senior Executive Service to the percentage of claims that have
not been completed within six months of entering the system. Further,
directing those withheld funds directly to be used to combat the
backlog ensures that the money is spent wisely on addressing those in need
as opposed to simply becoming a slush fund for the VAs overall
budget.
Additionally, my office stands ready to serve those who
need help navigating the VA or have become frustrated processing a
claim.
Taking care of our military men and women is one of our most
important duties.
While I recognize we have tough choices ahead,
I know we must work to solve our fiscal crisis without sacrificing the
safety of our nation or the livelihood of the great men and women who
have fought to defend
it.
Sincerely,
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress

Story
Recently, a 95-year-old WWII veteran contacted my Concord office
looking for help dealing with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The
veteran had been waiting several months for a decision to be made on
his claim. My staff was able to work directly with the VA to have the
decision expedited and get this veteran what he truly
deserved.
If you need help navigating a federal agency, please dont
hesitate to call our Concord office at
704-786-1612 .

Four years ago today, on March 23, 2010, President Obama
signed Obamacare into law. On top of
causing uncertainty
for our employers
and creating a part-time economy, this harmful
law is forcing hard-working Americans to deal with rising health care
costs, restricted access and canceled insurance
plans.
We can do
better, and I will continue to fight for quality, affordable health care
for you and your families.
I promise to continue to do
everything I can to defund, repeal and replace
Obamacare.
