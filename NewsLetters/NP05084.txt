&ldquo;Senate Battle Looks As Competitive As Ever.&rdquo;
Friend -- Current projection?
50 Democrats - 50 Republicans.
And FOUR Democratic Southern women are TIED or LEADING.
But Hillary Clinton had an urgent warning this morning:
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t act before midnight, our chance to keep control of the Senate -- and make historic gains for women -- will begin to fade.&rdquo;
Before our FINAL one-week-out advertising buy deadline, we NEED your help.
New GOP attacks are flying every single minute, and with only 8 days left, we MUST stop them before they give Republicans the win!
Will you answer Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s call to action and pitch in? Your gift will be triple-matched.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Take a second to think about this:
In eight days, Mitch McConnell could be gone. Out of a job. Out of the Senate. Seriously, his race is tied.
But we need you on board to make it happen. The GOP&rsquo;s $5 million ad spending advantage is a real danger, and you need to step up and answer these attacks.
We just CAN&rsquo;T let Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz take the majority.
Please pitch in right away to stop a Republican Senate takeover. Remember: Your gift will be triple-matched until midnight.
Thanks,
Democratic Victory
