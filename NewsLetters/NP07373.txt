What a Week!
Dear Friend,
Upholding the Constitution
Last week, the House Armed Services Committee passed Congressman Scott Rigell's (VA-02) bipartisan resolution (H.Res 644) condemning the Presidents failure to notify Congress before transferring
five dangerous Taliban detainees from the United States detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, including Mohammed Fazl, Deputy Minister of Defense for the Taliban. The full House of Representatives is expected to vote on Rigells Resolution in September.
Rep. Rigell said, In transferring the five senior members of the Taliban to the government of Qatar the President broke the law. Specifically he has failed to uphold Article II Section 3 of the Constitution which states that the President must 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed' and in doing so he has placed an unnecessary burden on the relationship between Congress and the Administration.
Rigell further noted this was not a partisan measure, but a matter of protecting American national security.
In an interview on Fox &amp; Friends, Rigell said, to prevent [the President's actions] from becoming precedent that either this Administration or future administrations could rely upon
it was important to put this legal marker in the ground and to repudiate and clearly condemn what the President did.
Congressman Rigells bipartisan resolution was cosponsored by 93 other members of the House of Representatives, including two Democrats.

Encouraging Girls to Study STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)
Congressman Rigell recently introduced H.R. 5165, the Advancing Girls in STEM Act. This important bipartisan legislation would increase exposure and awareness of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields for elementary and middle school girls.
Currently, 74 percent of all workers in STEM fields are male, and women in stem fields earn 33% more than women in non-STEM fields.
I know from my own familys experience that early education can have a big influence on a young girls career path, said Congressman Scott Rigell, who noted that his youngest daughter majored in biochemistry and microbiology in college as a direct result of encouragement she received from one of her childhood teachers. Encouraging young women to pursue careers in STEM is critical to advancing greater economic success for women and continuing Americas global leadership. But we have to provide opportunities to jumpstart girls interest in STEM fields at an early age.
Through a competitive grant program, this bill will encourage young girls to pursue an advanced education and career in STEM fields, while helping to address our nations STEM workforce inequities.

You Should Go...
To the Virginia Living Museum in Newport News!
From the Virginia Living Museum website:
Calling future animal keepers and vets! Play, learn and dream in the new permanent exhibit, Wild &amp; Well, that opened June 21 at the Virginia Living Museum, Newport News. Designed primarily for pre-K to 3rd grade children, the exhibit offers hands-on exploration and learning about animal health with a secondary message about human health.
Kids learn best through creative play, says VLM Deputy Executive Director Fred Farris. As they play the roles of animal keepers and vets, they will learn about being healthy. They will also come to appreciate the key roles of the museums animal keepers and vets, people whose jobs are mostly done out of sight of the public.
This summer only, see a new gang of dinosaurs in DINOS LIVE! Tremble at a growling T-rex. Watch an Edmontosaurus mother tend her brood. See Euoplocephalus, built like a military tank, and Styracosaurus, one of the most spectacular of the horned lizards. The dinosaur that highlights the link between non-avian dinosaurs and birds is the Citipati. New this summer is a tented outdoor dinosaur excavation area. Amateur paleontologists can dig through a mound of fossil-filled sediment and then identify and take home real fossils. The exhibit runs through September 1.
The Virginia Living Museums permanent living exhibits explore the nature of Virginia from the mountains to the sea. Visitors immerse themselves in two-level walk-through habitats of an Appalachian cove and cypress swamp, explore the underwater world of the Chesapeake Bay and the underground world of a limestone cave and enjoy hands-on discovery centers. Travel the universe in the planetarium theater or see spectacular views of the sun from the observatory. Outdoors, animals native to Virginia live in naturalized habitats along a 3/4-mile elevated boardwalk that also includes native plant gardens and childrens nature playground.
