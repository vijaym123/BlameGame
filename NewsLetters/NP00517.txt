David,
Today is a very special day. We take time to remember everyone who has sacrificed so that we could live in a free, democratic nation.
To all those who have fallen, and all of our veterans and members of the military and their families, I want to thank you. Your bravery is inspiring beyond compare.
After serving our country, our veterans deserve quality care and jobs. In Congress, I&rsquo;m continuing to fight for those who have worn the uniform of our country and ensure they get the benefits they&rsquo;ve earned and deserve.
I hope you have a safe and happy Memorial Day surrounded with friends and family.
Sincerely,
Cheri
