Budgeting for a Secure
Future
3/25/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn issued the following statement regarding
his budget votes.
"I
supported the Republican Study Committee and Price #2 budget proposals put
forward on the House Floor because I strongly believe that either of
these plans put us on a path towards fully funding our national security,
reforming entitlements, and bringing our budget into balance in the
near future. These budgets also repeal Obamacare and lawless executive
amnesty, as well as simplifying the tax
code.
The next step must be to push the Senate to
make sure that a conservative and fiscally responsible budget reaches
the President's desk. We should force President Obama to explain to the
American people why he does not support a budget that returns America
to a position of fiscal strength and
stability."
