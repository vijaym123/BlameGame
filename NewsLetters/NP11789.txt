Dear Friend,
I wanted to share with you an editorial by the Washington Post that ran
earlier this week about President Obama's foreign policy approach. I
believe this well written editorial highlights the views that many of
us share regarding the approach the current Administration has taken to
the recent foreign policy challenges facing the United States.
At this critical time, America needs to exhibit bold leadership and I
believe this editorial reinforces the need for this approach to world
events.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress
President Obama's foreign policy is based on fantasy
Washington Post, Editorial Board, March 2 2014
FOR FIVE YEARS, President Obama has led a foreign policy based more on
how he thinks the world should operate than on reality. It was a world
in which "the tide of war is receding" and the United States could,
without much risk, radically reduce the size of its armed forces. Other
leaders, in this vision, would behave rationally and in the interest of
their people and the world. Invasions, brute force, great-power games
and shifting alliances - these were things of the past. Secretary of
State John F. Kerry displayed this mindset on ABC's "This Week" Sunday
when he said, of Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine, "It's a 19th
century act in the 21st century."
Unfortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin has not received the
memo on 21st-century behavior. Neither has China's president, Xi
Jinping, who is engaging in gunboat diplomacy against Japan and the
weaker nations of Southeast Asia. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is
waging a very 20th-century war against his own people, sending
helicopters to drop exploding barrels full of screws, nails and other
shrapnel onto apartment buildings where families cower in basements.
Mr. Obama is not responsible for their misbehavior. But he does, or
could, play a leading role in structuring the costs and benefits they
must consider before acting. The model for Mr. Putin's occupation of
Crimea was his incursion into Georgia in 2008, when George W. Bush was
president. Mr. Putin paid no price for that action; in fact, with parts
of Georgia still under Russia's control, he was permitted to host a
Winter Olympics just around the corner. China has bullied the
Philippines and unilaterally staked claims to wide swaths of
international air space and sea lanes as it continues a rapid and
technologically impressive military buildup.
The White House often responds by accusing critics of being warmongers
who want American "boots on the ground" all over the world and have yet
to learn the lessons of Iraq. So let's stipulate: We don't want U.S.
troops in Syria, and we don't want U.S. troops in Crimea. A great power
can become overextended, and if its economy falters, so will its
ability to lead. None of this is simple.
But it's also true that, as long as some leaders play by what Mr. Kerry
dismisses as 19th-century rules, the United States can't pretend that
the only game is in another arena altogether. Military strength,
trustworthiness as an ally, staying power in difficult corners of the
world such as Afghanistan - these still matter, much as we might wish
they did not. While the United States has been retrenching, the tide of
democracy in the world, which once seemed inexorable, has been
receding. In the long run, that's harmful to U.S. national security,
too.

Dear
Friend,
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
an
editorial
by
the
Washington
Post
that
ran
earlier
this
week
about
President
Obama&#8217;s
foreign
policy
approach.
I
believe
this
well
written
editorial
highlights
the
views
that
many
of
us
share
regarding
the
approach
the
current
Administration
has
taken
to
the
recent
foreign
policy
challenges
facing
the
United
States.
At
this
critical
time,
America
needs
to
exhibit
bold
leadership
and
I
believe
this
editorial
reinforces
the
need
for
this
approach
to
world

President
Obama&#8217;s
foreign
policy
is
based
on
fantasy
Washington
Post,
Editorial
Board,
March
2
2014
FOR
FIVE
YEARS,
President
Obama
has
led
a
foreign
policy
based
more
on
how
he
thinks
the
world
should
operate
than
on
reality.
It
was
a
world
in
which
&#8220;the
tide
of
war
is
receding&#8221;
and
the
United
States
could,
without
much
risk,
radically
reduce
the
size
of
its
armed
forces.
Other
leaders,
in
this
vision,
would
behave
rationally
and
in
the
interest
of
their
people
and
the
world.
Invasions,
brute
force,
great-power
games
and
shifting
alliances
&#8212;
these
were
things
of
the
past.
Secretary
of
State
John
F.
Kerry
displayed
this
mindset
on
ABC&#8217;s
&#8220;This
Week&#8221;
Sunday
when
he
said,
of
Russia&#8217;s
invasion
of
neighboring
Ukraine,
&#8220;It&#8217;s
a
19th
century
act
in
the
21st
century.&#8221;
Unfortunately,
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
has
not
received
the
memo
on
21st-century
behavior.
Neither
has
China&#8217;s
president,
Xi
Jinping,
who
is
engaging
in
gunboat
diplomacy
against
Japan
and
the
weaker
nations
of
Southeast
Asia.
Syrian
president
Bashar
al-Assad
is
waging
a
very
20th-century
war
against
his
own
people,
sending
helicopters
to
drop
exploding
barrels
full
of
screws,
nails
and
other
shrapnel
onto
apartment
buildings
where
families
cower
in
basements.
Mr.
Obama
is
not
responsible
for
their
misbehavior.
But
he
does,
or
could,
play
a
leading
role
in
structuring
the
costs
and
benefits
they
must
consider
before
acting.
The
model
for
Mr.
Putin&#8217;s
occupation
of
Crimea
was
his
incursion
into
Georgia
in
2008,
when
George
W.
Bush
was
president.
Mr.
Putin
paid
no
price
for
that
action;
in
fact,
with
parts
of
Georgia
still
under
Russia&#8217;s
control,
he
was
permitted
to
host
a
Winter
Olympics
just
around
the
corner.
China
has
bullied
the
Philippines
and
unilaterally
staked
claims
to
wide
swaths
of
international
air
space
and
sea
lanes
as
it
continues
a
rapid
and
technologically
impressive
military
buildup.
The
White
House
often
responds
by
accusing
critics
of
being
warmongers
who
want
American
&#8220;boots
on
the
ground&#8221;
all
over
the
world
and
have
yet
to
learn
the
lessons
of
Iraq.
So
let&#8217;s
stipulate:
We
don&#8217;t
want
U.S.
troops
in
Syria,
and
we
don&#8217;t
want
U.S.
troops
in
Crimea.
A
great
power
can
become
overextended,
and
if
its
economy
falters,
so
will
its
ability
to
lead.
None
of
this
is
simple.
But
it&#8217;s
also
true
that,
as
long
as
some
leaders
play
by
what
Mr.
Kerry
dismisses
as
19th-century
rules,
the
United
States
can&#8217;t
pretend
that
the
only
game
is
in
another
arena
altogether.
Military
strength,
trustworthiness
as
an
ally,
staying
power
in
difficult
corners
of
the
world
such
as
Afghanistan
&#8212;
these
still
matter,
much
as
we
might
wish
they
did
not.
While
the
United
States
has
been
retrenching,
the
tide
of
democracy
in
the
world,
which
once
seemed
inexorable,
has
been
receding.
In
the
long
run,
that&#8217;s
harmful
to
U.S.
national
security,
too.
