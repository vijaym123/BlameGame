(!) POLL ALERT (!) The race for Congress is a dead-heat.
But now Rove's spending $1.4 million to bash President Obama and defeat our Democratic candidates.
We're not about to let Karl Rove beat us with an unchallenged August ad blitz.
So here's the deal:
Our next ad buy deadline is
tomorrow .
It'll take
$1 million
to close the spending gap.
We don't have much time. But if everyone who&rsquo;s been waiting chips in
$5
or more today, we can get there. Can you chip in today?
