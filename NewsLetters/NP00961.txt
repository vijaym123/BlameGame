HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
[cid:image003.jpg@01D089BB.FBAD1B60]
NDAA increases NMI service academy slots - We are running out of room for qualified Northern Mariana Islands students in the U.S. military service academies . There are six slots and with this year's admissions process completed, we will have two NMI cadets who accepted appointments at the U.S. Air Force Academy, two at the Military Academy at West Point, and one midshipman at the Naval Academy - leaving only one opening. But a provision added to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 1735 , during mark-up last week fixes that by adding one more NMI slot at each academy. House Armed Services Committee member Madeleine Z. Bordallo (D-Guam) sponsored the amendment, Section 564 of the bill, adding one opening at each academy for Guam and for the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If the provision is enacted, we will then have 4 positions available for Northern Marianas residents in the coming year. There is clearly demand for appointments to the military service academies. When I first came to office in 2009 I quickly got the number of Northern Marianas slots doubled from 3 to 6 in Section 527 of Public Law 111-84 . Those positions are almost full now, time to add more.
Defense bill adds new requirement before military can acquire land - When the U.S. military negotiates to acquire real property, transactions over $750,000 have to be approved in law by Congress. But these negotiations sometimes leave local governments without enough voice in where the military locates. That is why the House included a provision in last year's National Defense Authorization Act
- and again in the NDAA marked up by the House Armed Services Committee
last week - that requires the military to consult with the Governor of the State or Commonwealth, where the land is, to look at options and alternatives. This is similar to the requirement for consultation between the Air Force and the Governor of the CNMI, regarding location of the divert airfield, that I included in the 2014 Defense bill report
in response to wide public rejection of Saipan as the divert location. As a result of those consultations, a new "hybrid" option by the military is now under consideration by the Commonwealth government. The consultation provision the Armed Services Committee put into the Defense bill again this year does not change the legal requirement that Congress must approve purchases over $750,000; it adds another layer of local input in the decision-making, which I fully support.

Ms. Kathy He of Marianas High School received a Congressional Commendation this week in recognition of winning the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. Her father Sinhua He, MHS Principal Cherlyn Cabrera, and MHS Art Teacher Justin McAlister came with her for the presentation at their Saipan congressional office. A panel of local artists chose Kathy's artwork from among a record 43 entries by Northern Marianas high schoolers. Her picture will be displayed for a year at the U.S. Capitol, alongside students' art from congressional districts nationwide.
Rota and Tinian harbor projects get $700,000 each - The House approved my request for $1.4 million for Rota and Tinian harbor improvements in the FY16 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill
we passed on May 1. This is the first year of direct funding for the two projects, which will eventually cost about $3 million each. On Rota the Army Corps of Engineers will determine what changes need to be made to the harbor so that ships can get in no matter what the weather conditions. This has been a recurring problem for Rota that has at times left the community short of food and other necessities. On Tinian the Corps will prepare designs for upgrading the World War II-era breakwater. Both projects require a match from the Commonwealth government. There has been a $200,000 waiver of that local match since 1987, but I was able to increase the waiver last year in Public Law 113-121, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act , immediately saving Commonwealth taxpayers $510,000 on this stage of the two harbor projects.
In the same appropriation bill the House also agreed to keep funding at current levels for the State Energy Program and the Weatherization Assistance Program, from which the Commonwealth is receiving $195,000 and $160,000, respectively.

Norman T. Tenorio, Managing Director of Joeten Enterprises Inc. and President and CEO of Pacifica Insurance Underwriters Inc., was named the 2014 Guam Business Magazine Executive of the Year at the GBM 32nd Annual Gala in January. I presented Mr. Tenorio with a Congressional Commendation, recognizing his achievement. Mr. Tenorio proudly embodies the legacy of his parents, the late Jose C. and Soledad T. Tenorio, in his contribution to business and to our community. Congratulations, Norman!
Affordable Care Act continues to benefit CHCC - The Commonwealth remains on track to make complete use of the $109 million of additional Medicaid funds we included for the Northern Mariana Islands in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation is the main beneficiary of this money. About $1 million per month has been coming to the Northern Marianas since July 2011 - $46.1 million in total as of April 30 - and coincided with the cut-off of almost all local funding for CHCC. $63 million remains available through the end of 2019. This new ACA money is in addition to the regular Medicaid grant funds to the NMI, which have totaled $20.5 million over the same period. The Republican majorities in the U.S. House and Senate agreed this week to a budget plan that will repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Making the world a safer place - The people of the Northern Mariana Islands understand what it means to have neighboring countries armed with nuclear weapons, especially when those neighbors, such as North Korea, also have ballistic missile capability. The fewer the nations that are nuclear armed, the safer we all will feel. That is why I supported efforts to keep these weapons out of the hands of Iran in a letter to President Obama
this week. The President's negotiation team, along with representatives of the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, the P5+1, recently concluded a framework understanding with Iran that is intended to keep that country from building nuclear weapons. But even more difficult negotiations are ahead to finalize an agreement. Critics have called it a bad deal, but until the deal is concluded that judgment is premature. Some argue we should go to war with Iran, but it seems to me that will only harden that country's resolve to arm itself with nuclear weapons - if not now, in the future. The P5+1 may ultimately fail in this diplomatic effort. But surely we should try holding back Iranian efforts to gain the bomb through peaceful means and a verifiable agreement, if we possibly can.
