Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I read last year,
but was reminded of in the last few weeks due to the increased climate
change rhetoric from the ideological left.
The article, "Dialing Back
the Alarm on Climate Change
,"
is by columnist Matt Ridley.
For years, I have been saying that man-made global warming is an
unsettled matter and that we are currently in the midst of a naturally
occurring environmental cycle, evidenced by previous warming and
cooling periods.
I am open to proof that human activity contributes to
climate change and that it is threatening the safety of our planet, but
I do not believe the matter to be settled science.
Make no mistake, as a conservative, I believe that we should absolutely
conserve the resources we have and ensure we leave a better Earth for
future generations.
However, we should not sacrifice jobs, drive up
the cost of living, or increase the debt left to our children due to
unsettled science or a politically motivated rush to judgment.

Empowering People to Live Better Lives - House FY15 Budget Passes House
This week, the House Budget for Fiscal Year 2015, that I coauthored
with my Budget Committee colleagues, was considered and passed by the
House of Representatives.
The FY15 Budget balances, makes responsible reforms to safety net
programs, helps to create jobs and economic growth.
For the third year
in a row, the House budget included Medicaid reforms, found in my State
Health Flexibility Act,
to strengthen the program by block
granting funds to the states.
States and local communities can
determine best who is poor and how best to give them a hand up from
poverty.
This budget is another balanced budget that will empower Americans to
build better lives for themselves and their families.
By contrast the
Senate offers no plan and the President's budget raises taxes and
further grows the size and cost of the federal government.

Advancing Education Reform - Strengthening Education Through Research
Passes Committee
On Tuesday, the full Education and the Workforce Committee
passed with strong bipartisan support legislation that I
introduced as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood,
Elementary, and Secondary Education, the Strengthening Education
Through Research Act, H.R. 4366
.
You can watch my remarks offered in support of my bill during the
hearing here
.
Chairman Rokita Speaks in Support of HR 4366 4-8-14.
I am grateful for the support of members from both sides of the aisle
because quality education research is critical to successful schools.
To raise student achievement levels, teachers and school leaders need
good data on what works - and what doesn't - in the classroom. The
legislation we introduced will improve education research, protect
taxpayers by enhancing program accountability, and help ensure more
schools and students can benefit from effective education practices.
The Strengthening Education through Research Act
:
*	Enhances the relevancy of education research at the state and
local levels, helping teachers, students, parents, and policymakers
access more useful information about successful education practices.
*	Streamlines the federal education research system, preventing
overlap, redundancy, and duplication of research efforts.
*	Improves accountability and protects the taxpayers' investment
by requiring regular evaluations of research and education programs.
*	Preserves and enhances focus on research regarding educational
equity and closing achievement gaps.
*	Strengthens privacy provisions to ensure personally
identifiable information collected by IES is secure and protected.
*	Maintains the autonomy of IES, the National Assessment
Governing Board, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(also known as the Nation's Report Card) to shield these entities from
political influence and bias.
To learn more about the bill, visit the Committee website here
.
In addition, the Committee passed, with strong bipartisan support, the
Success and Opportunity through Quality Charters Act
, a bill I coauthored that reauthorizes
and combines the Charter School Program and Charter School Credit
Enhancement Program, to strengthen the Charter School Program and allow
successful charter school models to be replicated nationwide to support
choice, innovation, and excellence in education.
You can learn more
about this bill here via the Committee website

Protecting Hoosier Workers' Freedom and Privacy
On Thursday, the Education and Workforce Committee considered and
passed two bills, that I cosponsored, to roll back attempts by the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to weaken workforce democracy and
employee privacy.
The Workforce Democracy and Fairness Act, H.R. 4320, and the Employee
Privacy Protection Act, H.R. 4321
, will
ensure access to fair union elections and protect workers' personal
privacy.
I spoke in support of H.R. 4320 during the hearing.
You can watch
those remarks here

Rokita Supports Hoosier Workplace Fairness 4-9-14
Under this Administration for far too long, Members of Congress,
American workers, employers, and their families have been fighting an
activist National Labor Relations Board that has been acting in the
interests of Big Labor rather than as the impartial referee for labor
disputes.
The decision to unionize is an important one, and employees deserve the
opportunity to make this choice in a reasonable time frame.
Employers
deserve the time to listen and talk with their employees as well.
These bills will ensure fairness for all parties and protect the
private lives of employees.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita
