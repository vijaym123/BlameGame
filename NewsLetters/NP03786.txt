Kansas Common Sense
December 22, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
I hope you and your family enjoy this holiday season. I send you my
best wishes for the year ahead and wish you a very Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year. This week, Jewish families in Kansas and around the
world are observing the eight-day celebration of Hanukkah. I wish my
Jewish friends and neighbors a very happy Hanukkah. I hope the new year
brings a Congress better capable of working together for the well-being
of our nation.
Proposal to Modify U.S.-Cuba Trade Policy
On Wednesday, American Alan Gross was released by the Cuban government
and allowed to return to the United States. For five years, Alan and
his family have endured pain and profound injustice amid his detainment
in Cuba. News of Alan's release brings great relief to his loved ones
and to every American who has called for his freedom. I admire Alan's
strength and that of his wife Judy, who has worked tirelessly for years
to free Alan and reunite her family. During my time in the Senate, I
had the opportunity to meet Judy Gross and authored legislation calling
on both the American and Cuban governments to expedite his release. I
am glad that Alan is finally home and that the Gross family can
celebrate this holiday season together.
Following Alan's release, the Administration proposed to alter America's
policy concerning Cuba in a positive step toward improved economic ties
that could benefit citizens of both nations. I have long fought to
change the unilateral U.S. sanctions and regulations that restrict the
ability of our farmers and ranchers to sell their products to Cuba.
Cuba is only 90 miles from our border, making it a natural market for
U.S. agricultural commodities, including Kansas wheat. Cuba imports
approximately 80 percent of the food they consume. Wheat is Cuba's
largest food commodity import and second-largest import overall, behind
only oil. While the United States has unilaterally erected trade
barriers that harm our own farmers, other countries are more than happy
to fill this market. For example, this year Cuba has purchased $150
million worth of wheat from the European Union alone.
It simply does not make sense to continue policies and regulations
blocking Kansas farmers from this market only for it to be filled by
our competitors. Industry experts believe that U.S. wheat could grow to
80-90 percent of the market share in Cuba if the trade restrictions are
eased, similar to our market share in other Caribbean nations.
Considering it costs an average of $20-25 per ton to ship grain from
Europe to Cuba versus about $6-7 per ton from the United States, it
makes economic sense for U.S. commodities to make up the lion's share
of the Cuban market.
Kansas leads the nation in wheat milling and production, but many other
U.S. and Kansas commodities would also benefit from opening the Cuban
market. A 2010 Texas A&M; study estimates that easing restrictions and
lifting the travel ban could result in $365 million in additional sales
of U.S. agricultural commodities, boost the U.S. economy by $1.1
billion, and create 6000 new jobs.
Beyond providing a new market for U.S. farmers, easing restrictions on
trade and travel with Cuba may bring about reforms in the repressive
Cuban government - reforms that more than 50 years of the current
policy have not achieved. Current U.S. policy only serves to limit
American's freedom to trade and travel with the island nation while
contributing to the ongoing misery of the Cuban people. A change in our
nation's approach that can open Cuba up economically and politically
through the exchange of commodities and ideas is necessary.
I have often said, in Kansas we will try anything once - sometimes
twice or even three times. However, if we have been trying something
for over five decades and it has yet to work, it is time to change
direction. It is time to change our Cuba policies. It is time for U.S.
farmers and ranchers to truly have market access to Cuba's 11 million
consumers.
Key Committee Appointments in New Congress
In the new Congress I will serve on several key U.S. Senate committees
whose jurisdictions have a direct impact on our nation's economy and
the lives of Kansans:
*	U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
*	U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee
*	U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations
*	U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs
*	U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs
In January, we begin to forge a new path. As a member of the Commerce,
Banking and Appropriations Committees I look forward to advocating for
pro-growth policies that create jobs and more economic opportunity for
every American.
In my role on Commerce, Science and Transportation, I will work to
provide valuable oversight on a wide range of issues including
communications, highways, aviation, rail, shipping, transportation
security, fisheries, science, space, interstate commerce and numerous
others.
Additionally, there is no group of Americans I hold in higher regard
than our veterans, who bravely put their lives at risk to protect the
freedoms and liberties we all enjoy. They kept their promise to us and
we must keep our promise to them. I am humbled to have the opportunity
to continue working on behalf of those who have honorably served our
country.
Passage of Tax Extenders and ABLE Act
Late Tuesday night, the U.S. Senate passed the Achieving a Better Life
Experience (ABLE) Act, legislation that enables the creation of
tax-exempt ABLE Accounts to assist individuals with disabilities and
their families to save and pay for qualified disability expenses. I
have been a sponsor of this legislation since 2012, and it will allow
individuals with disabilities or the parents of a child with a
disability to save money to cover expenses such as education, housing,
transportation, employment training, and assistive technology. This new
policy will encourage personal responsibility and eliminate barriers to
work that can exist within federal entitlement programs. I encourage
President Obama to swiftly sign this bill into law as it overwhelmingly
passed the House earlier this month. Thanks to Jawanda and Rachel Mast
of Olathe, the Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City, and the Down
Syndrome Society of Wichita for their insight on this important
legislation over the past few years. Click here
to learn more about
Rachel's story.
The ABLE Act was passed in conjunction with H.R. 5771, legislation to
extend several temporary corporate and individual tax provisions
through 2014. Retroactive to January 1 of this year, H.R. 5771 allows
taxpayers to claim these credits for the upcoming tax filing season,
which include the restoration of Section 179 financing to its previous
$500,000 limit. Critical to the ability of Kansas farmers and small
businesses to replace old equipment and stay competitive, the Section
179 limit abruptly fell to $25,000 at the end of 2013 - barely enough
to buy a new pickup. Having passed both chambers of Congress, this
legislation now heads to the President's desk for signature.
Discussing Unique Challenges Facing Kansas Hospitals and Health Care
Providers
I spoke on the Senate floor last week about the unique challenges
Kansas hospitals and health care providers face caring for patients in
our state-often in very rural settings across wide areas. During my
time representing Kansans in Washington, D.C., I have had the
opportunity to visit each of the 128 community hospitals. Almost every
visit involves concerns about the harmful impacts and massive
uncertainty caused by the Affordable Care Act, as well as the ever
increasing federal regulatory burdens hospitals face as they work to
provide quality health care to their local residents. There will be a
renewed opportunity in the new Congress to undo the damage caused by
Obamacare and present real solutions to problems facing the Kansas
health care providers and patients.
USDA Listens to Producers, Will Not Create New Beef Checkoff Program
Friday morning, I was pleased to learn that the U.S. Department of
Agriculture will not move forward with a new, separate beef checkoff. I
believe that changes to the checkoff should be supported by producers,
not forced upon them by the federal government. Cattle producers I
visited with from across Kansas were loud and clear in their objections
to USDA administratively creating a new checkoff.
Last month, I sent a letter to USDA expressing my concern that they
were acting against the clear wishes of producers. I was concerned that
creating a new checkoff would be duplicative and add administrative
costs. Perhaps most importantly though, I felt that the concerns of
Kansas cattle producers were being ignored. I appreciate that Secretary
of Agriculture Tom Vilsack ultimately listened to cattle producers from
across the country who objected to this new checkoff. Click here

Importance of Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act
The invisible wounds of war plague thousands of veterans across our
country and there are some who feel the only choice to deal with their
wounds is to take their own life. The average suicide rate among
veterans is a staggering 22 deaths each day. With epidemic-levels of
suicide afflicting veterans, the VA has a fundamental duty to not only
provide them the best quality mental health care services but the VA
must also do everything necessary to save their lives. I took to the
Senate floor on Wednesday evening to share the story of Clay Hunt and
discuss legislation that was created in his name to make certain the VA
is capable of supporting veterans battling the same struggles he did
before tragically taking his own life.
During a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing last month, I was
privileged to hear Clay's story directly from his mom, Susan Selke.
Susan shared her son's troubles of reliving the traumatic experiences
of war and his disappointment when the VA failed to offer the care he
needed to treat his despair. Although it had to be extremely difficult
for Clay's mom to share his story, her courage and willingness to
explain what happened to her son gives us the opportunity to identify
what the VA must change to save others like Clay in the future.
As a sponsor of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, I was hopeful the
Senate would pass this critical legislation after it unanimously passed
in the House earlier this month. This bill would be instrumental in
developing a VA system capable of offering first-rate mental health
care services, as well as utilizing the expertise of outside
organizations to provide support for those struggling from their
wartime experiences. It would also provide for a new website that
offers veterans information regarding available mental healthcare
services; create a pilot loan repayment program for VA psychiatrists;
and improve the exchange of training, best practices, and other
resources among the VA, Veteran Service Organizations (VSO), and
nonprofit mental health organizations to enhance collaboration of
suicide prevention efforts.
I was disappointed the legislation was blocked from consideration this
week in the Senate. It is critical that the VA follow through on its
commitment to our nation's veterans - especially so families who have
lost loved ones know the VA is committed to suicide prevention to care
for others who served our country. There should be no excuse for the VA
bureaucracy, push back and delays, or acceptance that this is just the
way the VA system works. I will urge and sponsor reintroduction of Clay
Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act in the new Congress,
and will keep working to find solutions and to hold the VA accountable
when it comes to providing our nation's veterans with the timely,
high-quality and dedicated care they earned.
Kansas Listening Tour Stops in Howard and Winfield
On Thursday I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with two stops. First
I met with Elk County residents in the community of Howard. The folks
who attended wanted to discuss getting back to a normal functioning
Senate - passing appropriations bills so Congress has power and
authority over our country and it's not governed by executive order. We
also talked about maintaining a strong military, taking care of our
veterans and making sure our children are getting a well-rounded
education. A group representing RSVP from several counties were present
and thanked me for my support of their programs throughout the state.
Thanks again to Lynne Thompson and the Elk County Farm Bureau for
hosting the town hall.
Next, in conjunction with Winfield Kiwanis Club, I hosted a Kansas
Listening Tour stop at Baden Square. Thanks to all the area residents
who came out to discuss a number of issues including the Affordable
Care Act's impact on community hospitals, the new veterans' health care
law, and how to make certain small businesses survive in rural
communities. Thanks to Winfield Kiwanis Club President Ruth Gordon and
club member Glen Sambolte for hosting the conversation.
Visits to Johnson County Businesses
On Friday I visited several business in Johnson County. My day started
at Black & Veatch where I met with CEO Steven Edwards and other senior
leaders at their company's global headquarters in Overland Park. Black
& Veatch was founded in 1915 by two KU grads and today is one of the
largest private companies in the country, employing about 10,000
professionals and with completed projects in more than 100 countries.
Next, I headed to PQ Corporation in Lenexa where I met with Mike Boyce
and other members of the PQ team to discuss federal regulations. PQ
Corporation manufactures chemicals that make the products we use every
day safer or more effective. From ingredients in toothpaste and facial
cleaner to water treatment and paint, PQ Corporation work impacts our
lives. Thank you again to the PQ team for the informative visits.
I ended my day Friday with a visit to McCarthy Chevrolet in Olathe
which also serves Overland Park, Kansas City, Lee's Summit,
Independence, Blue Springs, Shawnee, Mission, Topeka, and Lawrence. My
meeting with John McCarthy focused on the state of the economy and the
type of pro-growth policies Washington can put into place to make
certain Kansas business can continue to thrive. It is always inspiring
to hear about the innovation and success of great Kansas companies.
Thanks again to Black & Veatch, PQ Corporation and McCarthy Chevrolet
for the good conversations.

Proposal
to
Modify
U.S.-Cuba
Trade
Policy On
Wednesday,
American
Alan
Gross
was
released
by
the
Cuban
government
and
allowed
to
return
to
the
United
States.
For
five
years,
Alan
and
his
family
have
endured
pain
and
profound
injustice
amid
his
detainment
in
Cuba.
News
of
Alan's
release
brings
great
relief
to
his
loved
ones
and
to
every
American
who
has
called
for
his
freedom.
I
admire
Alan&#8217;s
strength
and
that
of
his
wife
Judy,
who
has
worked
tirelessly
for
years
to
free
Alan
and
reunite
her
family.
During
my
time
in
the
Senate,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
Judy
Gross
and
authored
legislation
calling
on
both
the
American
and
Cuban
governments
to
expedite
his
release.
I
am
glad
that
Alan
is
finally
home
and
that
the
Gross
family
can
celebrate
this
holiday
season
together.
Following
Alan&#8217;s
release,
the
Administration
proposed
to
alter
America&#8217;s
policy
concerning
Cuba
in
a
positive
step
toward
improved
economic
ties
that
could
benefit
citizens
of
both
nations.
I
have
long
fought
to
change
the
unilateral
U.S.
sanctions
and
regulations
that
restrict
the
ability
of
our
farmers
and
ranchers
to
sell
their
products
to
Cuba.
Cuba
is
only
90
miles
from
our
border,
making
it
a
natural
market
for
U.S.
agricultural
commodities,
including
Kansas
wheat.
Cuba
imports
approximately
80
percent
of
the
food
they
consume.
Wheat
is
Cuba&#8217;s
largest
food
commodity
import
and
second-largest
import
overall,
behind
only
oil.
While
the
United
States
has
unilaterally
erected
trade
barriers
that
harm
our
own
farmers,
other
countries
are
more
than
happy
to
fill
this
market.
For
example,
this
year
Cuba
has
purchased
$150
million
worth
of
wheat
from
the
European
Union
alone.
It
simply
does
not
make
sense
to
continue
policies
and
regulations
blocking
Kansas
farmers
from
this
market
only
for
it
to
be
filled
by
our
competitors.
Industry
experts
believe
that
U.S.
wheat
could
grow
to
80-90
percent
of
the
market
share
in
Cuba
if
the
trade
restrictions
are
eased,
similar
to
our
market
share
in
other
Caribbean
nations.
Considering
it
costs
an
average
of
$20-25
per
ton
to
ship
grain
from
Europe
to
Cuba
versus
about
$6-7
per
ton
from
the
United
States,
it
makes
economic
sense
for
U.S.
commodities
to
make
up
the
lion&#8217;s
share
of
the
Cuban
market.
Kansas
leads
the
nation
in
wheat
milling
and
production,
but
many
other
U.S.
and
Kansas
commodities
would
also
benefit
from
opening
the
Cuban
market.
A
2010
Texas
A&amp;M
study
estimates
that
easing
restrictions
and
lifting
the
travel
ban
could
result
in
$365
million
in
additional
sales
of
U.S.
agricultural
commodities,
boost
the
U.S.
economy
by
$1.1
billion,
and
create
6000
new
jobs.
Beyond
providing
a
new
market
for
U.S.
farmers,
easing
restrictions
on
trade
and
travel
with
Cuba
may
bring
about
reforms
in
the
repressive
Cuban
government
&#8211;
reforms
that
more
than
50
years
of
the
current
policy
have
not
achieved.
Current
U.S.
policy
only
serves
to
limit
American&#8217;s
freedom
to
trade
and
travel
with
the
island
nation
while
contributing
to
the
ongoing
misery
of
the
Cuban
people.
A
change
in
our
nation's
approach
that
can
open
Cuba
up
economically
and
politically
through
the
exchange
of
commodities
and
ideas
is
necessary.
I
have
often
said,
in
Kansas
we
will
try
anything
once
&#8211;
sometimes
twice
or
even
three
times.
However,
if
we
have
been
trying
something
for
over
five
decades
and
it
has
yet
to
work,
it
is
time
to
change
direction.
It
is
time
to
change
our
Cuba
policies.
It
is
time
for
U.S.
farmers
and
ranchers
to
truly
have
market
access
to
Cuba&#8217;s
11
million
consumers.

Passage
of
Tax
Extenders
and
ABLE
Act
Late
Tuesday
night,
the
U.S.
Senate
passed
the
Achieving
a
Better
Life
Experience
(ABLE)
Act,
legislation
that
enables
the
creation
of
tax-exempt
ABLE
Accounts
to
assist
individuals
with
disabilities
and
their
families
to
save
and
pay
for
qualified
disability
expenses.
I
have
been
a
sponsor
of
this
legislation
since
2012,
and
it
will
allow
individuals
with
disabilities
or
the
parents
of
a
child
with
a
disability
to
save
money
to
cover
expenses
such
as
education,
housing,
transportation,
employment
training,
and
assistive
technology.
This
new
policy
will
encourage
personal
responsibility
and
eliminate
barriers
to
work
that
can
exist
within
federal
entitlement
programs.
I
encourage
President
Obama
to
swiftly
sign
this
bill
into
law
as
it
overwhelmingly
passed
the
House
earlier
this
month.

Discussing
Unique
Challenges
Facing
Kansas
Hospitals
and
Health
Care
Providers
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
floor
last
week
about
the
unique
challenges
Kansas
hospitals
and
health
care
providers
face
caring
for
patients
in
our
state&#8212;often
in
very
rural
settings
across
wide
areas.
During
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
128
community
hospitals.
Almost
every
visit
involves
concerns
about
the
harmful
impacts
and
massive
uncertainty
caused
by
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
as
well
as
the
ever
increasing
federal
regulatory
burdens
hospitals
face
as
they
work
to
provide
quality
health
care
to
their
local
residents.
There
will
be
a
renewed
opportunity
in
the
new
Congress
to
undo
the
damage
caused
by
Obamacare
and
present
real
solutions
to
problems
facing
the
Kansas
health
care
providers
and
patients.
USDA
Listens
to
Producers,
Will
Not
Create
New
Beef
Checkoff
Program
Friday
morning,
I
was
pleased
to
learn
that
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
will
not
move
forward
with
a
new,
separate
beef
checkoff.
I
believe
that
changes
to
the
checkoff
should
be
supported
by
producers,
not
forced
upon
them
by
the
federal
government.
Cattle
producers
I
visited
with
from
across
Kansas
were
loud
and
clear
in
their
objections
to
USDA
administratively
creating
a
new
checkoff.
Last
month,
I
sent
a
letter
to
USDA
expressing
my
concern
that
they
were
acting
against
the
clear
wishes
of
producers.
I
was
concerned
that
creating
a
new
checkoff
would
be
duplicative
and
add
administrative
costs.
Perhaps
most
importantly
though,
I
felt
that
the
concerns
of
Kansas
cattle
producers
were
being
ignored.
I
appreciate
that
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
ultimately
listened
to
cattle
producers
from
across
the
country
who
objected
to
this
new
checkoff.

Importance
of
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act
The
invisible
wounds
of
war
plague
thousands
of
veterans
across
our
country
and
there
are
some
who
feel
the
only
choice
to
deal
with
their
wounds
is
to
take
their
own
life.
The
average
suicide
rate
among
veterans
is
a
staggering
22
deaths
each
day.
With
epidemic-levels
of
suicide
afflicting
veterans,
the
VA
has
a
fundamental
duty
to
not
only
provide
them
the
best
quality
mental
health
care
services
but
the
VA
must
also
do
everything
necessary
to
save
their
lives.
I
took
to
the
Senate
floor
on
Wednesday
evening
to
share
the
story
of
Clay
Hunt
and
discuss
legislation
that
was
created
in
his
name
to
make
certain
the
VA
is
capable
of
supporting
veterans
battling
the
same
struggles
he
did
before
tragically
taking
his
own
life.
During
a
Senate
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
hearing
last
month,
I
was
privileged
to
hear
Clay&#8217;s
story
directly
from
his
mom,
Susan
Selke.
Susan
shared
her
son&#8217;s
troubles
of
reliving
the
traumatic
experiences
of
war
and
his
disappointment
when
the
VA
failed
to
offer
the
care
he
needed
to
treat
his
despair.
Although
it
had
to
be
extremely
difficult
for
Clay&#8217;s
mom
to
share
his
story,
her
courage
and
willingness
to
explain
what
happened
to
her
son
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
identify
what
the
VA
must
change
to
save
others
like
Clay
in
the
future.
As
a
sponsor
of
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act,
I
was
hopeful
the
Senate
would
pass
this
critical
legislation
after
it
unanimously
passed
in
the
House
earlier
this
month.
This
bill
would
be
instrumental
in
developing
a
VA
system
capable
of
offering
first-rate
mental
health
care
services,
as
well
as
utilizing
the
expertise
of
outside
organizations
to
provide
support
for
those
struggling
from
their
wartime
experiences.
It
would
also
provide
for
a
new
website
that
offers
veterans
information
regarding
available
mental
healthcare
services;
create
a
pilot
loan
repayment
program
for
VA
psychiatrists;
and
improve
the
exchange
of
training,
best
practices,
and
other
resources
among
the
VA,
Veteran
Service
Organizations
(VSO),
and
nonprofit
mental
health
organizations
to
enhance
collaboration
of
suicide
prevention
efforts.
I
was
disappointed
the
legislation
was
blocked
from
consideration
this
week
in
the
Senate.
It
is
critical
that
the
VA
follow
through
on
its
commitment
to
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
&#8211;
especially
so
families
who
have
lost
loved
ones
know
the
VA
is
committed
to
suicide
prevention
to
care
for
others
who
served
our
country.
There
should
be
no
excuse
for
the
VA
bureaucracy,
push
back
and
delays,
or
acceptance
that
this
is
just
the
way
the
VA
system
works.
I
will
urge
and
sponsor
reintroduction
of
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act
in
the
new
Congress,
and
will
keep
working
to
find
solutions
and
to
hold
the
VA
accountable
when
it
comes
to
providing
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
with
the
timely,
high-quality
and
dedicated
care
they
earned.
Kansas
Listening
Tour
Stops
in
Howard
and
Winfield
On
Thursday
I
continued
my
Kansas
Listening
Tour
with
two
stops.
First
I
met
with
Elk
County
residents
in
the
community
of
Howard.
The
folks
who
attended
wanted
to
discuss
getting
back
to
a
normal
functioning
Senate
&#8212;
passing
appropriations
bills
so
Congress
has
power
and
authority
over
our
country
and
it's
not
governed
by
executive
order.
We
also
talked
about
maintaining
a
strong
military,
taking
care
of
our
veterans
and
making
sure
our
children
are
getting
a
well-rounded
education.
A
group
representing
RSVP
from
several
counties
were
present
and
thanked
me
for
my
support
of
their
programs
throughout
the
state.
Thanks
again
to
Lynne
Thompson
and
the
Elk
County
Farm
Bureau
for
hosting
the
town
hall.
Next,
in
conjunction
with
Winfield
Kiwanis
Club,
I
hosted
a
Kansas
Listening
Tour
stop
at
Baden
Square.
Thanks
to
all
the
area
residents
who
came
out
to
discuss
a
number
of
issues
including
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
impact
on
community
hospitals,
the
new
veterans&#8217;
health
care
law,
and
how
to
make
certain
small
businesses
survive
in
rural
communities.
Thanks
to
Winfield
Kiwanis
Club
President
Ruth
Gordon
and
club
member
Glen
Sambolte
for
hosting
the
conversation.
Visits
to
Johnson
County
Businesses
On
Friday
I
visited
several
business
in
Johnson
County.
My
day
started
at
Black
&amp;
Veatch
where
I
met
with
CEO
Steven
Edwards
and
other
senior
leaders
at
their
company&#8217;s
global
headquarters
in
Overland
Park.
Black
&amp;
Veatch
was
founded
in
1915
by
two
KU
grads
and
today
is
one
of
the
largest
private
companies
in
the
country,
employing
about
10,000
professionals
and
with
completed
projects
in
more
than
100
countries.
Next,
I
headed
to
PQ
Corporation
in
Lenexa
where
I
met
with
Mike
Boyce
and
other
members
of
the
PQ
team
to
discuss
federal
regulations.
PQ
Corporation
manufactures
chemicals
that
make
the
products
we
use
every
day
safer
or
more
effective.
From
ingredients
in
toothpaste
and
facial
cleaner
to
water
treatment
and
paint,
PQ
Corporation
work
impacts
our
lives.
Thank
you
again
to
the
PQ
team
for
the
informative
visits.
I
ended
my
day
Friday
with
a
visit
to
McCarthy
Chevrolet
in
Olathe
which
also
serves
Overland
Park,
Kansas
City,
Lee's
Summit,
Independence,
Blue
Springs,
Shawnee,
Mission,
Topeka,
and
Lawrence.
My
meeting
with
John
McCarthy
focused
on
the
state
of
the
economy
and
the
type
of
pro-growth
policies
Washington
can
put
into
place
to
make
certain
Kansas
business
can
continue
to
thrive.
It
is
always
inspiring
to
hear
about
the
innovation
and
success
of
great
Kansas
companies.
Thanks
again
to
Black
&amp;
Veatch,
PQ
Corporation
and
McCarthy
Chevrolet
for
the
good
conversations.
