Friends,
There must be something in the water
in the Palmetto State, and I am not talking about the unusual
clear blue coastline
at
Folly Beach.
On Friday, the Department of Employment and Workforce
revealed that
job creation in South Carolina is up, and our
states unemployment rate is down, dropping from Marchs 5.5 percent to
5.3 percent
in April.
Since small businesses create 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs (depending
on the year), I cannot think of a better way to end National Small
Business Week.
Last week, I held a Seventh District
Small Business Roundtable Meeting to honor National Small Business Week.
It was great to meet with some of our districts small
businesses, thank them for all they do for our community and hear their
concerns.
While we discussed a variety of issues from tax rates, to the
national debt and budget process, to port dredging,
I would
like to highlight a few concerns that were raised and what my
colleagues and I are doing to address them.
A
local bank president shared examples of how
government
regulations are hurting his bank and particularly, the banks
middle-class customers .
He explained that lending regulations have
made it extremely difficult to approve loans for middle-class
families and entrepreneurs.
Meanwhile, their rich customers have no
trouble obtaining loans, allowing them to take more risks in the market
with investments or startup ventures.
A community
banks inability to loan capital to a middle-class family wanting to
purchase a house or an emerging entrepreneur trying to launch a new
business, impacts our entire community. This difficulty is felt by our
housing market and realtors, our contractors, and our job seekers.
I
am pleased to inform you that two weeks ago the
House of
Representatives passed legislation that would expand lending
options
for rural and community banks so they can loan capital to
consumers.
Military Officer Association of America (MOAA)
Awards Ceremony
Last week, I had the privilege of
participating in the MOAA Grand Strand Chapters JROTC Awards Ceremony.
Pictured above: Lt. Col. Roger Pilcher and I presenting
Christopher Monte with the MOAA scholarship. I had the honor of
nominating Christopher it one of our nation's military academies.
Christopher is looking forward to attending the Naval Academy in the Fall.

the MOAA scholarship. Benjamin will attend Presbyterian College in Clinton, SC this
Fall.
During our
meeting, a representative from the Georgetown Chamber told us that a number
of
businesses in Georgetown have put expansion plans on
hold.
These businesses cannot afford to take any risks when
they are unsure how Obamacare's
30-hour
workweek rule
will impact their bottom lines.
A recent
NFIB study shows that Obamacares Health
Insurance Tax will cost the economy up to 286,000 jobs,
and 57 percent of those jobs will be from small businesses. This is
the kind of uncertainty from Washington that kills jobs and economic
growth.
Unfortunately, this is only the tip of the
iceberg.
With the Administration changing the law on a whim and
further delaying already delayed provisions, families and businesses are
struggling to deal with uncertainty.
While Congress has enacted
12 bills to delay or repeal parts of Obamacare , we
must continue to try to provide businesses with certainty and protect
Americans from soaring health care costs.
JAG Initiation &amp;
Instillation Ceremony
Jobs for
Americas Graduates
(JAG) is a wonderful program that helps at-risk
students overcome socioeconomic barriers and prevents students from
dropping out of high school.
This program has been
successful throughout South Carolina and has been expanding over the
years.
I had the privilege to speak to students from South Florence High
School during the initiation and instillation ceremony of the
schools Career Center Association for JAG students.
These impressive
young people, pictured below, are determined to graduate and make a
difference in the world. I wish them all the best in their journey to
success.

Charlene Hope, and I sat down to tape a panel discussion for local TV
