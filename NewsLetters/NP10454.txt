Jobs Remain
Our Top Priority
Dear Friend,
Over the past week, I had the
opportunity to spend time meeting with
constituents throughout the Fifth District.
I toured small businesses in Warrenton,
visited with students and faculty at UVa
and Lord Fairfax Community College, met
with farmers in a number of our rural
communities, attended a successful job fair
in Danville, and celebrated the
groundbreaking for the Commonwealth
Crossing Business Centre in Henry County.
The week served as yet another reminder
that jumpstarting our economy to create
more jobs remains the top priority in
Central and Southside Virginia.
I was pleased to take part in two events
that demonstrated that opportunities are on
the horizon for our communities.
Danvilles job fair, sponsored by the
Danville Pittsylvania County Chamber of
Commerce, was an encouraging display, with
35 area employers advertising nearly 700
available positions. The groundbreaking of
the Commonwealth Crossing Business Centre
signals that this site can now begin
attracting more jobs to Henry County and
Southside Virginia.
While generating opportunities in areas
with excessively high unemployment is
vital, ensuring that local workers are
well-trained to be qualified for these jobs
is just as important. The federal
government works with states on a number of
well-intended workforce training
initiatives, but many of these programs are
ineffective because they are laden with
bureaucracy, waste, and inefficiency. With
our limited resources, we must ensure that
workers have access to the most efficient
training that will prepare them for the
opportunities coming their way.
To address these critical issues, last
year, the House passed the Supporting
Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills
(SKILLS) Act
a measure that will
modernize our federal workforce training
programs to ensure that they are
effectively helping workers, jobseekers,
and employers. I hope the Senate will take
up this important bill that strengthens
these programs, eliminates waste, and will
get our friends, neighbors and family
members back to work.
I am encouraged by the recent progress
that we have seen, and I look forward to
continuing to work with my colleagues to
bring more jobs to Central and Southside
Virginia so that we may create a brighter
future for our nation.
