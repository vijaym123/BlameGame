The EPAs Latest Target: Wood Stoves
Dear Friends,
Last week, the EPA finalized its rule to control another perceived threat to the global ecosystem: wood stoves.
I think we have all seen this exploding trend at the EPA to control and regulate anything it can get its hands on.
But I believe this latest move shows just how desperate to expand its authority the EPA is.
The newly minted rule is designed to restrict wood stove manufacturers to EPA approved stoves with stringent soot level emission requirements, which will, of course, swell the cost of wood stoves.
The EPA justifies this rule by informing us just how deadly soot and wood smoke can be.
Well, I suppose if you stuck your head down a chimney and breathed nothing but smoke and soot, then that might pose some problemsbut thats why we dont do that.
Wood stoves are one of the most dependable, independent, and effective heaters in the market.
If you can find wood you can find fuel.
And in harsh Wyoming winters they are especially critical.
I think the EPA has simply grown out of control and has overstepped its bounds again by reaching into our homes and telling us what we can and cannot purchase to keep our own families warm.
I know we need to rein in the EPA and other federal agencies and as I work to do just that, please let me know your
thoughts and concerns .
Sincerely,
