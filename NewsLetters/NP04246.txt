Immigration
As our nation has continued to discuss how to best address the
significant issues with our immigration system, time and time again,
President Obama has made it clear that he did not have the authority to
act unilaterally. Unfortunately, he has now decided that politics trump
that fact, and has issued executive orders to make changes on his own.
America is both a compassionate nation and a nation of laws, and to
keep that balance the White House must work with Congress, not, as the
old phrase goes, take their ball and go home. Together, we can address
the current issues with targeted, responsible efforts that secure the
border, enforce existing U.S. laws, and create a workable, efficient
system for future immigrants.
Keystone XL Pipeline
When a bill came to the Senate floor that would have finally given the
green light to the creation of thousands of jobs, we saw Senate
Democrats and the President continue to block construction of the
Keystone XL Pipeline. Their opposition to the creation of tens of
thousands of jobs continues to amaze, and six years of stalling and
delaying must come to an end.
While we all agree our energy policy should promote sustainable,
accessible and affordable sources of energy, decision-makers too often
forget the affordable piece. The fact of the matter is if your income
is under $30,000, 25 percent of your income goes towards energy
consumption. This is an incredible burden to place on single parents
and low-income families struggling to make their ends meet.
Keystone provides opportunity not only to address that issue in the
broader topic of energy, but to specifically address issues faced by
millions and millions of Americans - unemployment and energy poverty.
While Senate Democrats unfortunately once again ignored these facts, I
look forward to tackling this issue in the Republican majority next
year.
Protecting Choice in Childcare
As part of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (S. 1086)
passed by the U.S. Senate this past week, I submitted an amendment to
help protect parents' choice in childcare providers, including
faith-based organizations. I am happy to report that it passed the
Senate and has been signed into law by the President.

As we head back into a busy season, I with you and your family a very
happy and safe Thanksgiving!
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

Immigration
As
our
nation
has
continued
to
discuss
how
to
best
address
the
significant
issues
with
our
immigration
system,
time
and
time
again,
President
Obama
has
made
it
clear
that
he
did
not
have
the
authority
to
act
unilaterally.
Unfortunately,
he
has
now
decided
that
politics
trump
that
fact,
and
has
issued
executive
orders
to
make
changes
on
his
own.
America
is
both
a
compassionate
nation
and
a
nation
of
laws,
and
to
keep
that
balance
the
White
House
must
work
with
Congress,
not,
as
the
old
phrase
goes,
take
their
ball

go

Together,
we

Their

and
six
