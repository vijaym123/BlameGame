Paying Respect on Memorial Day
America's greatness is drawn from the blood and sacrifice of the brave
men and women who have gone before us and who defend the freedom we
enjoy today. Each and every one of them deserves to be front and center
in our thoughts on Memorial Day.
On Monday, May 26, at the Veterans Memorial Wall and at the Veterans
Salute Memorial Day Program at the Beaches Veterans Memorial Park in
Atlantic Beach, I will join in paying my respects to the fallen and
underscore the heroism of those who are still fighting for our liberty
around the globe. See below for schedule.
JACKSONVILLE - 9 a.m. - Crenshaw attends and helps lay wreath at
Memorial Day Ceremonies at the Veterans
Memorial Wall.
ATLANTIC BEACH
- 2:30 p.m. - Crenshaw provides keynote address for
the Veterans Salute Memorial Day Program at the Beaches Veterans
Memorial Park in Atlantic Beach
Holding the VA Accountable
The widespread and systematic lack of accountability in our VA medical
system is horrifying. People have suffered the ultimate consequence of
death, and the VA needs new tools to foster accountability and restore
confidence.
The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act,
legislation that passed the House on Wednesday with my support, is a
step in the right direction toward ensuring VA officials are held
accountable for mistakes. Specifically, the bill would give the
Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs the complete authority
to fire or demote senior VA officials based on performance.
Heads should roll if we find out people have lost their life because
somebody's covered something up, manipulated numbers, or cooked the
books on how long you wait.
JAXPORT Dredging, Mile Point Fix Take "Giant Step"
Forward with Passage of WRRDA Conference Report
Tuesday's passage of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
Conference Report (HR 3080) means JAXPORT dredging and a fix for Mile
Point are authorized. That's a giant step forward for job creation and
economic growth in the Northeast Florida.
I've backed these projects from day one and couldn't be happier to vote
for the conference report.
With the long-overdue removal of navigation
hazards at Mile Point and the dredging of the St. Johns River, large
cargo container ships can move into to the region, bringing more trade,
more jobs, and a stronger economy for decades to come. That's a win-win
across the board.
Ander outlines the economic benefits of dredging the St. Johns at a
March program at JAXPORT.
