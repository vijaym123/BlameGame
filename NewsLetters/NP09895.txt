LEGISLATION
May 11, 2014
Dear
David,
Providing a high quality education for
America's children is the vehicle of opportunity in our country. Last
week, I toured Forest Ranch Charter School
a tuition-free, public
charter school in Butte County. I was pleased to see the remarkable job that
is being done to offer choice in education to students and their
families.
High quality Charter schools, such as Forest Ranch,
play a critical role in our countrys education system. They help
advocate choice in school selection, local control of curriculum, and, in
some areas, enable students in poor-performing districts to have an
opportunity to succeed. These charter schools accomplish all of these
goals despite receiving fewer taxpayer dollars per student than normal
public schools.
Rep. LaMalfa visiting with students from Forest Ranch Charter School.
On Friday,
I voted in favor of legislation that would strengthen our public
education system and increase educational opportunities for all students.
H.R. 10 , the Success and Opportunity through
Quality Charter Schools Act, reauthorizes and modernizes the existing
charter school program under the Elementary and Secondary Act. The bill
allows states to use federal funds to start new charter schools as well
as expand and replicate existing high-quality charter
schools.
This measure, which passed out of the House, empowers parents and
students with access to an education system that works for them by
prioritizing the introduction, expansion, and replication of successful
charter school programs. We owe it to our students to make sure they
receive the very best education
available.
