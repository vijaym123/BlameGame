Colmery ONeil VA
Medical Center in Topeka :
As many of you are aware, the
Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Centers emergency room
shut down
operations in January and federal VA officials were sent to investigate
serious allegations that were brought to my attention. I have been in
close contact with the administrators at Colmery-ONeil to ensure
corrective actions were taken, and was encouraged to see progress being
made during my last visit to the VA Medical Center in
June.
However, in June, I was assured the facility had hired new physicians
and staff, and that they were ready to reopen. Yet, it is now August,
and the emergency room is still closed.
Too often the VA
requires constant supervision to get them to do their job. It appears the
problem now is a lack of communication and action at the national
level. The VA must do its most basic job, without Members of Congress
breathing down their backs.
The recent VA legislation that
passed Congress and was signed into law by the President was a good first
step in addressing failures like this, and will hold VA officials
accountable. However, there is no grace period for the new leadership at
the VA. Our veterans have waited long enough and I will continue to
pressure VA officials until the emergency room at Colmery-ONeil is
reopened.

Preempting Any
Potential Cuts to Kansas Military Forts :
This
week, the Kansas delegation joined forces to fight for our military
communities at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley. We sent letters to
Secretary of the Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff General Raymond
Odierno to prevent potential cuts to personnel and operations at Fort
Leavenworth and Fort Riley as a result of the Armys planned
Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Assessment (SPEA). This assessment will
ultimately determine force reductions at Army installations all over
the country.
The delegation detailed line by line the
critical roles of both forts in regards to our national security and
the Army. We asked the Army to consider the impact personnel reductions
would have on our local communities, and the state of Kansas.
Fort Leavenworth remains the Intellectual Center of the Army, and no
other military installation in the country is equipped to provide the
critical training and education Fort Leavenworth offers our elite
forces.
We will continue, in the weeks ahead, to remind the Army
of the unique, quality, and imperative training provided to our
soldiers at these installations, and we will fight any ill-considered cuts
at either Fort.
