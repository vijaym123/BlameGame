Dear Fellow Nevadan,
For over half a century, we have
celebrated National Small Business Week to recognize the contributions that so
many outstanding small business owners, entrepreneurs, and job
creators have made in our communities. In Nevada, small businesses represent
almost 96 percent of all employers, so it is clear how important
these firms are to our states economic recovery. Our economy is
improving, but if we want to put hard working Nevadans back to work, we have to
continue to support our small businesses.
That is why I am
delighted to recognize the following 2014 Nevada Small Business Award
Winners:
Small Business Persons of the Year -
Season Lopiccolo, Jarrod Lopiccolo, and Michael Thomas of Noble Studio,

Woman-Owned Business of the Year - Donna
