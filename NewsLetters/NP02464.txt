Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last weekend, I flew to Chicago to welcome my 10th grandchild, Katie Grace into the world. I was grateful for the opportunity to spend time with my daughter and hold Kate before flying back to Washington.

On Saturday, I participated in an Eagle Scout Court of Honor for Joseph Andrew Wolski in Winter Garden. It was a pleasure to join Boy Scout Troop 225, the Wolski family, and members of the community as I presented Joseph with a certificate of Congressional recognition and congratulated him on attaining the Eagle Scout ranking.

Last week, I had quite a few meetings in Washington. Members of the Central Florida YMCA came to my office to discuss their plans to expand their efforts with the Department of Veterans Affairs and serve veterans. It was great to see Don Wilcox, the new CEO of Central Florida YMCA and Wayne Humphrey, who are both committed to serving our community through the various programs and opportunities that the Y offers.
Some of the other meetings I had last week included:
-
Florida Farm Bureau Federation
-
Polk County Government Officials
-
Florida Central Rail
-
American Burn Association
-
Florida Association of Broadcasters
-
Congenital Heart Disease Representatives
-
Florida Coalition for Children
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office regarding the Refugee Asylum petitions he had filed on behalf of his wife and three children.
The constituent had escaped from Egypt to avoid being killed by members of the Muslim Brotherhood and was anxious for his family to join him.
My office followed up with the National Visa Center and Egyptian Embassy to verify they had received the approved petitions.
My staff kept in touch with the constituent and the Embassy while they scheduled the family member interviews and finally received confirmation that they had been able to join him safely in the United States. The constituent was very appreciative of the help and assistance our office provided to him and his family.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
After much wrangling, the House and Senate finally passed a one-week funding extension for the Department of Homeland Security on Friday. This extension was designed to allow the House and the Senate the opportunity to appoint a conference committee to negotiate the differences between the House and Senate positions on the President's immigration orders.
Do you believe the House and Senate should proceed to Conference to work out a solution on which they can both agree?
Yes
No
I don't know

No - 19%
I don't know - 1%
Legislative Update:
Over six weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation that fully funded the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while simultaneously reining in the Presidents egregious executive overreach on immigration. Not until last week, as we sat on the precipice of DHS funding lapsing, was the Senate able to act.
While I am disappointed that Senate Democrats obstructed this process in an effort to shield the Presidents immigration overreach from debate, I am pleased they finally relented in at least allowing DHS to be funded at the eleventh hour.
As regular order dictates, both chambers should now go to conference to reconcile the differences between these two positions. The House has passed a short term funding measure to ensure that our national security efforts will remain fully funded and operational while these negotiations take place.
The Senate should immediately appoint conferees and begin negotiations with respect for the Constitutions clearly defined separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches.
