Dear Friends,
My office is now accepting entries for the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. I invite all high school students living in the 14th Congressional District to participate in this unique opportunity to gain national recognition for their creative talents.
The winner will receive a trip to Washington, D.C. for an honorary reception where Members of Congress will recognize the finalists from all 50 states. The winning art pieces will be displayed for one year in the main corridor between the U.S. Capitol and the House Office Buildings.
All artwork must be two dimensional, cannot be larger than 28&rdquo;x28&rdquo;x4&rdquo; including the frame, cannot weigh more than 15 pounds, and must be original in concept, design and execution. All high school students and 7th and 8th graders who share high school campuses residing in the 14th district are eligible. Please find detailed
guidelines , a
submission checklist
and the

my website .
The deadline for submissions is April 24, 2015 at 5 p.m.
Please deliver your art pieces to my District Office at 155 Bovet Road, suite 780, San Mateo, CA 94402. A panel of professional artists will judge the pieces. I will host a reception for all participants, their parents and teachers at my office on a date to be announced soon.
Since the Congressional Art Competition began in 1982, more than 650,000 students have participated and taken advantage of this wonderful event celebrating and encouraging art. I look forward to seeing your art piece in my District Office soon!
