The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last week, I spoke with several of our local reporters to share with them the legislative process that I envision for a productive and principled Congress. The
Orlando Sentinel
wrote an article about my white paper entitled
Widgets, Principles, and Republicans,
in which I lay out my desire for a legislative process based on principle rather than power.
The Ledger ran an editorial , affirming that Webster was right to push for a return to normal legislative sausage-making, because the current method is certainly painful to watch.
In the national news, the Washington, D.C. newspaper, The Hill, asked to write a profile piece that included the work I had done as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and Majority Leader in our state senate. Although the headline was flattering:
Run for Speaker makes Webster a rock star,
I was happier about the opportunity to share my goals for a member-driven process, where we include every Member of Congress and seek to make them successful on behalf of their constituents.

It was an honor to once again participate in a Home at Last home dedication ceremony in Oakland this weekend. Marine Sgt. Stephen Tovet was injured by an IED explosion while serving on his fourth deployment to Afghanistan, resulting in the amputation of his left leg and part of his hand.
The Home at Last program just completed building a mortgage-free home in Oakland for this hero, and I was privileged to present a flag that I had flown over the Capitol in his honor, and officially welcome the Tovet family into our community.

Last weekend, the Clermont-Minneola Lions Club hosted their organizational district meeting, and I was glad to join Nick Jones, the incoming president of the club, in welcoming the Lions Club leadership from around the state and congratulating them for their community service. In honor of their services to our community, I gave the Clermont-Minneola club a flag flown over the Capitol as a commemorative token of appreciation for all the volunteer hours they have provided.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Minneola contacted my office regarding their application for a VA home loan. They were waiting on documents from the National Personnel Record Center (NPRC) that would allow them to receive their official Certificate of Eligibility. As the closing date approached, the required documents had still not been received, and they called my office to see if we could assist in expediting the process.
My office contacted the NPRC, who informed us that the documents had been filed, but were currently in a bureaucratic transition phase. Although the NPRC was not sure they could get it processed in time, they promised to try to get it through the process. Within a matter of hours, the NPRC personnel had been successful in retrieving the file and faxed the required documents to the constituent.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Last week France was rocked by multiple terrorist attacks that callously and cowardly took the lives of innocent civilians.
Al-Qaeda affiliates have since claimed responsibility and it is increasingly clear that continued instability in and around Syria and North Africa has resulted in hardened, combat terrorists slipping across international borders into neighboring European countries.
Do you believe the United States:
-
has a responsibility to aid in combating terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head as our values remain the true target of these organizations
-
has a responsibility to protect its homeland only if directly confronted.
We can no longer afford to be the world police.

I am not sure

Legislative Update:
Last week, the House of Representatives passed several important pieces of legislation. First, I voted to support H.R. 203, the
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act,
which will hold the government accountable for offering the mental health attention that many of our veterans require and deserve. This bill passed the House unanimously last Congress, but stalled in the Senate. I am hopeful new Senate leadership will make it a priority.
I
also voted for H.R. 33, the
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act,
legislation that will ensure emergency service volunteers can continue to operate and serve their communities without being unnecessarily constrained under the Affordable Care Act. Rather than placing an extra burden on our local municipalities, this legislation will exempt volunteer emergency service personnel from the employee restraints created within Obamacare.
Lastly, H.R. 185 calls for a more transparent process of writing federal rules and guidance that will impact our jobs and pocketbooks. The
Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015
will restrain the Executive Branch from circumventing public input and congressional oversight by issuing major policy changes through guidance documents, a loophole I have long advocated for closing. Last year, I sponsored legislation to close this loophole and spoke with the House Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte about the problems this unaccountable process holds. I am pleased that he agreed and included these changes in this bill.
