Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 113th
Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well.
Happy Super Bowl Sunday! Good luck today to former Wildcats Wesley
Woodyard, Danny Trevathan and Jacob Tamme! Big Blue Nation is behind
you! Go Broncos!
Encouraging President Obama to Focus on Jobs
During Tuesday night's State of the Union address, I had hoped to hear
about how the President will reduce our exploding federal debt, protect
the American people from the harmful effects of the new healthcare law,
and grow the economy to create jobs for hardworking families who are
suffering in this stagnant economy.
Unfortunately, the President offered the same failed approach of more
government spending, more job-crushing regulations, and higher taxes.
The House has passed dozens of jobs bills, many with bipartisan
support, that would help Americans get the jobs they deserve, honor
hardworking taxpayers, and make life easier for the American people.
Unfortunately, all of these proposals, including ones that would
unleash the energy potential of the United States by ending the War on
Coal and approving the Keystone Pipeline, are gathering dust in the
Senate.
It is time for the President to lead. It is time for him to stop trying
to divide the American people. It is time to focus on common ground and
good ideas, whether they are supported by Republicans or Democrats. The
focus should not be on the political battles in Washington, but on
getting the American people back to work.

Honored to be Joined by Cpl. Matthew Bradford for the State of the
Union
I was honored to be joined by Cpl. Matthew Bradford for Tuesday's State
of the Union address. Cpl. Bradford is a true American patriot who,
despite losing both his legs and his eyesight in an explosion while
serving in Iraq, re-enlisted with the Marines
in order to help other wounded service
men and women cope with their own injuries. While he is no longer
active-duty, Cpl. Bradford continues to be involved in the community
and is an active member of my Sixth District Veterans Coalition.
I am grateful for the opportunity to spend the evening with someone as
inspirational as Cpl. Bradford. And while we would have liked to catch
the end of a winning UK basketball game, we were glad to end the day
cheering on our beloved Cats!
Thank you for your service and dedication to our nation, Matt. You and
your family are true American heroes!
Passing A Fiscally Responsible Five-Year Farm Bill
This week, the House passed the Agricultural Act of 2014, also known as
the Farm Bill. This is an important victory for Kentucky's farmers.
This bipartisan, bicameral agreement on a five-year farm bill will
provide much-needed certainty and stability for producers while
reducing spending authority and eliminating wasteful direct payments.
I am especially glad that this fiscally responsible bill will allow
Kentucky to move forward with pilot programs for industrial hemp
cultivation and includes increased assistance to our food banks. This
bill also ensures that communities in the Sixth District, including
Nicholasville and Georgetown, will maintain access to USDA rural
development and housing programs that are critical to Kentucky
families.

Holding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Accountable
If you are on a mobile device, click here to watch the video
.
On Tuesday, during a House Committee on Financial Services hearing, I
questioned Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard
Cordray about the Bureau's plans to remedy the mis-designation of Bath
County, Kentucky as "non-rural" for purposes of lending rules that will
limit access to credit in the community significantly if not corrected.
When I asked whether the Bureau would be open to a process where people
in rural areas like Bath County, Kentucky could petition to correct the
CFPB's error so that the community would be properly classified as
"rural," I appreciated Director Cordray's acknowledgment that he "was
convinced [the CFPB] got the rural designation wrong, or that it
merited reconsideration."
It is clear that government bureaucrats don't always know best and
certainly don't know our local communities better than we do. I am
pleased that Director Cordray admitted the CFPB was wrong and agrees
with me on this important issue.
It is a win for Kentucky communities
that he has at least delayed the rule and taken the lending limitation
"off the table" for two years in order to reconsider.
While I understand why Director Cordray would not enthusiastically
embrace my bill to hold the CFPB more accountable to the American
people, I encourage him to support my bill, H.R. 2672, the CFPB Rural
Designation Petition and Correction Act. My legislation would remedy
these types of situations created by the government's flawed
"one-size-fits-all" policies by simply creating a way for citizens to
provide distant government bureaucrats with better information about
our own communities.

Working to Empower Parents
As the father of two young daughters, the quality of our nation's
education system is a high priority for me. When parents have a choice,
children have an opportunity. As we celebrate National School Choice
Week, I hope that the Senate will pass the Student Success Act, passed
by the House last year with my support, which would reform our
education system by putting control back in the hands of parents,
school leaders, and local communities.
It is important that we continue to come together as parents, teachers,
and advocates to improve education and I will continue working to
promote greater educational opportunity at all levels, while creating
an economy that can provide the ultimate incentive for all of those
years of hard work - a fulfilling career.
Polling Shows Kentuckians have "Unfavorable View" of Obamacare
Last week, a poll showed what Sixth District families have been telling
me all along - that Kentuckians' views on Obamacare do not reflect the
President's rosy State of the Union description. According to the
Kentucky Health Issues Poll released last week
by the Foundation For a Healthy Kentucky and Interact for Health,
nearly half of Kentucky adults have an unfavorable view of Obamacare,
while only 3 in 10 Kentucky adults reported having a favorable view of
the law, down from 34 percent in 2012.
Please LIKE and SHARE my Facebook post
if
you think we need to replace Obamacare with patient-centered reforms
that will lower costs and expand access to affordable, quality care
without putting bureaucrats between patients and doctors!
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.

I

the

will
reduce

from
the

are
suffering

the

the

Bradford
for
Tuesday's

is
a
true
American

who,
despite
losing
both

in
an

re-enlisted
with

in

cope
with

While

Passing
A
Fiscally
Responsible
Five-Year
Farm
Bill
This
week,
the
House
passed
the
Agricultural
Act
of
2014,
also
known
as
the
Farm
Bill.
This
is
an
important
victory
for
Kentucky&#8217;s
farmers.
This
bipartisan,
bicameral
agreement
on
a
five-year
farm
bill
will
provide
much-needed
certainty
and
stability
for
producers
while
reducing
spending
authority
and
eliminating
wasteful
direct
payments.
I
am
especially
glad
that
this
fiscally
responsible
bill
will
allow
Kentucky
to
move
forward
with
pilot
programs
for
industrial
hemp
cultivation
and
includes
increased
assistance
to
our
food
banks.
This
bill
also
ensures
that
communities
in
the
Sixth
District,
including
Nicholasville
and
Georgetown,
will
maintain
access
to
USDA
rural
development
and
housing
programs
that
are
critical
to
Kentucky
families.

Holding
the Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
Director
Accountable
If

watch
the
video .
On
Tuesday,
during
a
House
Committee
on
Financial
Services
hearing,
I
questioned
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB)
Director
Richard
Cordray
about
the
Bureau&#8217;s
plans
to
remedy
the
mis-designation
of
Bath
County,
Kentucky
as
&#8220;non-rural&#8221;
for
purposes
of
lending
rules
that
will
limit
access
to
credit
in
the
community
significantly if
not
corrected.
When
I
asked
whether
the
Bureau
would
be
open
to
a
process
where
people
in
rural
areas
like
Bath
County,
Kentucky
could
petition
to
correct
the
CFPB&#8217;s
error
so
that
the
community
would
be
properly
classified
as
&#8220;rural,&#8221;
I
appreciated
Director
Cordray&#8217;s
acknowledgment
that
he
&#8220;was
convinced
[the
CFPB]
got
the
rural
designation
wrong,
or
that
it
merited
reconsideration.&#8221;
It
is
clear
that
government
bureaucrats
don&#8217;t
always
know
best
and
certainly
don&#8217;t
know
our
local
communities
better
than
we
do.
I
am
pleased
that
Director
Cordray
admitted
the
CFPB
was
wrong
and
agrees
with
me
on
this
important
issue.
It
is
a
win
for
Kentucky
communities
that
he
has
at
least
delayed
the
rule
and
taken
the
lending
limitation
&#8220;off
the
table&#8221;
for
two
years
in
order
to
reconsider.
While
I
understand
why
Director
Cordray
would
not
enthusiastically
embrace
my
bill
to
hold
the
CFPB
more
accountable
to
the
American
people,
I
encourage
him
to
support
my
bill,
H.R.
2672,
the
CFPB
Rural
Designation
Petition
and
Correction
Act.
My
legislation
would
remedy
these
types
of
situations
created
by
the
government&#8217;s
flawed
&#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221;
policies
by
simply
creating
a
way
for
citizens
to
provide
distant
government
bureaucrats
with
better
information
about
our
own
communities.

would
