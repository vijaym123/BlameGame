Wicker: Tax Reform Should
Boost Jobs,
Not Drive More Gov't
Spending
GOP Congress Makes the Case for a Simpler
Tax Code That
Empowers
Workers
President Obama is pitching more of the same tax-and-spend proposals
this time to a Republican majority in Congress.
In his State of
the Union address on January 20, he outlined a tax plan that follows
a formula as misguided as it is familiar: funding more government
bureaucracy by imposing billions of dollars in tax hikes over the next
decade.
Finding Common
Ground
The tone of the annual speech was hardly an olive
branch to conservatives.
We have repeatedly urged the President
to work with us on bipartisan ideas to revitalize economic growth.
Historically, times of divided government have provided prime
opportunities for addressing protracted challenges like the complicated U.S.
tax system.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has said tax reform is
his top priority as the new chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
Both Republicans and Democrats
agree that simplifying America's 70,000-page tax code is long overdue.
Necessary reforms include closing special-interest loopholes,
lowering tax rates, and ensuring that business expansion and job creation
are encouraged, not punished.
The goal should be to free the
economy from the restraints of over-taxation and over-regulation and get
more Americans back to work and on the road to success
not to fuel a
big-government agenda.
Simply put, Americans should be allowed
to keep more of their hard-earned money to spend and invest as they see
fit, putting it back into the economy to spur entrepreneurship,
innovation, and productivity.
Challenging Obamacare's
Mandates
The President's
health-care law is a prime example of government intrusion with a crushing
price tag.
In addition to the rising premiums and cancellations
in coverage, Obamacare is expected to cause major confusion during
this year's tax season.
It is the first time that the law will be
included on Americans' tax forms, prompting experts to warn that
filing taxes could be especially frustrating.
Under the health-care law's individual mandate,
Americans who did not purchase government-approved insurance in 2014
will be penalized $95 or one percent of their income, whichever is
greater.
Likewise, those who received insurance subsidies could owe
money back to the government if they underestimated their incomes or
their salaries have changed.
I have consistently championed efforts to repeal the health-care law
and its burdensome mandates on American families and businesses.
These efforts are still underway in the new Congress.
One bill
I have cosponsored, titled the "American Liberty Restoration Act,"
would completely strike the tax penalty on uninsured Americans.
Another would change the law's definition of a full-time workweek from 30
hours back to 40 hours, protecting workers from losing their jobs or
work hours as companies struggle to comply.
'A Matter of
Necessity'
Empowering job creators and offering tax relief to American workers means
recognizing the financial burdens they bear because of a sweeping
health-care law and broken tax code.
In a recently released report from
the Senate Finance Committee on tax reform, Sen. Hatch wrote that
fixing the tax system is not "an optional exercise" but "a matter of
necessity."
The promise of a lasting economic recovery and the future
of the American worker depend on comprehensible tax laws and
confidence in free markets, without the threat of punitive tax burdens and
onerous compliance costs.
