Dear Friend,
The U.S. House of Representatives is
defending its constitutional authority.
This week, the House
voted to defund President Obamas political power play on immigration.
Led by conservatives who pressed leadership to act, we passed an
expansive rollback of his November executive actions.
Our bill
blocks the presidents attempt to end deportation of over four million
unlawful alien parents. It also claws back the presidents 2012
executive action to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program
for 600,000 people brought to the U.S. illegally as
children.
The critics said this would damage Republicans. They misread the
American people, who are sending a strong message that they object to
the presidents unilateral actions. Thats because the American people
love their Constitution and understand the importance of respecting
the rule of law.
Our bill fully funds the Department of
Homeland Security, boosting the border protection that must be the first
step in any immigration reform legislation. The bill will establish
the largest force levels in history at our borders, with 24-hour
surveillance of air, land and sea. The bill also strengthens internal
enforcement and investigations.
That this happened in the second
week of the new Congress shows Republicans are serious about fixing
our broken immigration system.
This weeks votes are a
good sign that strong, conservative legislation can easily pass the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Im encouraged that House
leadership incorporated conservative ideas into this bill. Republicans are
stronger when we pass legislation the American people are demanding. I
will continue to advocate for conservative solutions and make sure
our leadership continues to listen to the people we
serve.
Once weve responded to the presidents provocation, we can try real
reform. That starts with enforcing current law, securing our borders
and modernizing the visa system. Lasting reform doesnt put those here
illegally ahead of those who follow the law, as the president seems to
believe.
The battle with President Obama in the new
Congress just began. But this week the House drew a line in the sand that
even the president can understand: We wont let him put our
Constitution or security at risk for political gain.
Thank
you ,
