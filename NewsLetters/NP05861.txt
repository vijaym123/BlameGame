Ebola: What You Need to
Know
This week, Center for
Disease Control officials confirmed that an individual who recently
returned to the United States from Liberia has been diagnosed with
Ebola.
The patient has been placed in isolation in a Texas hospital
to prevent transmission.
Given this new development, it is important to underscore some
facts about Ebola.
Ebola can only spread from contact with the
blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or died from
Ebola.
It is not transmitted through air, water or food in the United
States.
The United States has some of the best doctors in the
world who are prepared to respond.

New Report:
3.6 Million
Americans Have Lost UI Benefits
A new report shows the number of people in each state who
have lost access to federal unemployment benefits through September as
a result of the termination of the program. Through the end of
September, more than 3.6 million people have been cut off unemployment
insurance because of the expiration of the Emergency Unemployment
Compensation program last December, according to new data from the Department
of Labor, including 43,900 in Michigan. The report cites several
studies that highlight the programs benefits to the economy and millions of
Americans since it was enacted in 2008.

Lawmakers Respond to Lake Erie
Drinking Water Crisis
On August 2, microcystin-laced toxic algae in Lake Erie
overtook the drinking water intake in Toledo, Ohio, resulting in the Toledo
water system warning 500,000 of its customers to turn off their taps
for three days.
Microcystin can cause vomiting, diarrhea and harm
to the liver.
The
algae bloom in Lake Erie was caused by dissolved phosphorus from
agriculture, livestock and sewage systems.
While algae blooms are
becoming more common in the Great Lakes and other areas of the country, the
federal government has not set federal guidelines for unsafe
consumption levels in drinking water.
Clearly additional steps need to be
taken to limit the flow of algae-feeding nutrients in our
waterways.
Rep. Levin and other lawmakers have also cosponsored the Safe and
Secure Drinking Water Act to require EPA to promptly develop drinking
water standards for
microcystin.
Rep.
Levin Issues Report
on the Transpacific Partnership Trade
Negotiations
Rep. Levin issued a
report
outlining the major outstanding issues within the
Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and called for the establishment of
an intensive bipartisan consultative process with Congress to
determine how to address pending issues and shortcomings within the
negotiations. The report, issued to the Council on Foreign Relations ahead of a
discussion on TPP there this morning, highlights the need for the
focus to remain on the TPP, and not on Trade Promotion
Authority.
The seven-page report lays
out specific areas within several key elements being negotiated that
remain outstanding, including worker rights, environmental protections,
access to medicines, human rights, currency manipulation, auto market
access in Japan, agricultural market access, state-owned enterprises,
food safety measures, investment and dispute settlement and tobacco
controls.
