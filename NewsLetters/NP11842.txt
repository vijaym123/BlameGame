Dear Friends,
As you'll see within the newsletter below, this was a very eventful week in our nation's capital.
For the second year in a row, the House of Representatives presented "Stop Government Abuse Week" to highlight and pass legislation to end the rampant breaching of Constitutional boundaries by agencies and authorities in Washington. Also this week, my friend and colleague Rep. Dave Camp - Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee - unveiled the long-awaited first draft of a plan to reform our nation's outdated tax code and strengthen our economy. Away from most of the headlines, yet nevertheless important, this past week also also saw even more bad news come out about the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare.
A
brand new study
released on Thursday confirms that Obamacare's cuts to Medicare Advantage (MA) will lead to reduced care and higher costs for seniors: MA
will see a 5.9% reduction in payment in 2015. These
cuts may result in benefit reductions and premium increases of $35-$75. Many
seniors could lose access to MA. These
cuts disproportionately affect low-income beneficiaries. This new data comes on top of
last week's startling report
quietly released by the Obama administration which revealed that
health care premiums will go up for two-thirds of American small businesses as a result of Obamacare.
The White House has previously promised that Americans can expect premiums to go down by as much as $2,000 under the health care law.
In reality, according to actuaries within the Obama administration, at least 11 million people who work at small businesses will see their premiums go up.
As I have stated numerous times, I do not have any patience for the continued broken promises about Obamacare by this administration, and remain as steadfastly opposed to this job-and-wage-killing law as ever. While I work with my colleagues to mitigate Obamacare's damage, I invite you to read about
the replacement plan
that I am co-sponsoring to make health care
more
affordable to the most vulnerable Americans -- in a way
that does
not
damage our economy or disrupt anyone's existing coverage.
Sincerely,
Rep.
Kelly Applauds
Free Tax-Filing Service for
Helping Pennsylvanians
Appears at event at Penn State Shenango to encourage eligible Pennsylvanians to utilize state Free File program
On Monday,
Rep. Kelly
participated in a public briefing on the Penn State Shenango campus in Sharon, Pennsylvania to highlight the state Free File program . Through a partnership with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), multiple companies offer free tax preparation software to 70 percent of taxpayers - those with Adjusted Gross Income of $58,000 or less - to file their taxes. The event was sponsored by the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
"I was thrilled to be able to attend today's briefing and highlight how Pennsylvanians can take advantage of a service to help file their taxes for free. While not costing a single dime of taxpayer money, the Free File program empowers Pennsylvanians to take charge of their taxes and keep more of their hard-earned money. It is an excellent example of how the government, the private sector, and community organizations can work together to help individuals and families take control of their finances around tax season. I am so glad that our commonwealth became one of more than 20 states to participate in this vital and innovative program."
NOTE:
The Free File program is a partnership between the IRS and name-brand tax software companies that provides eligible taxpayers free use of their tax software products. According to CCIA, Pennsylvania is one of 22 states (in addition to the District of Columbia) that sponsor a Free File program, allowing eligible residents to complete both their federal and state taxes easily and accurately. According to the IRS, 40 million taxpayers have prepared their federal returns through Free File services. More information about Free File can be found

Rep. Kelly Responds to
White House's
'Dangerous' Cuts
to National Defense
Calls Pentagon budget proposal "unworthy of a superpower"
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Tuesday regarding the Obama administration's proposed budget for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2015. According to
The Washington Post , "The most startling part of the plan is the proposal to cut the active-duty Army to between 440,000 and 450,000 soldiers, from a wartime peak of 570,000 - which would reduce the force to its smallest size since before World War II." According to
The New York Times , "In shrinking the United States Army to its smallest size since 1940, Pentagon officials said Monday that they were willing to assume more risk the next time troops are called to war. But assuming more risk, they acknowledged, meant that more of those troops would probably die."
"President Obama's proposed budget plan is a disgrace to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces and a dangerous dishonor to the world's most important military power which they nobly serve. By forcing a reduction of such historic proportions, these cuts to our national defense would send a signal of weakness and retreat to both our allies and our enemies abroad. They would severely hinder our ability to meet our responsibilities as the indispensable defender of peace and freedom around the globe, as well as our responsibilities to our veterans and their families here on the home front. Especially while our troops are still fighting overseas, and especially as threats to our security grow stronger and deadlier, there is virtually no good reason to adopt such a self-inflicted wound to our national defense capabilities. Yes, fiscal responsibility demands that all facets of the federal government be assessed for potential savings. However, if implemented, the White House's budget would not solve anything but rather invite and indeed accommodate an even more chaotic world with even more ominous challenges posed by other powers eager to exploit our decline. Overall, these proposed cuts are unworthy of a superpower such as ourselves and must be opposed for the sake of a safe and secure future for our country."
Rep. Kelly Cheers Introduction of Plan to Fix America's
Broken Tax Code
On Wednesday, Rep. Kelly - a member of the House Ways and Means Committee - issued the following statement in praise of the "discussion draft" of the Tax Reform Act of 2014 unveiled that afternoon by Way and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI). More information about this draft piece of legislation can be found
here .
"Today is a bright day for all American taxpayers who've been waiting for a fairer, less complex, and less costly tax code. After countless debates, dozens of hearings, and nearly three decades of delay, the ball is finally rolling toward serious pro-growth tax reform and that is a milestone over which to be both relieved and optimistic.
"For far too long our country has been held back by its own outdated, 70,000-page tax code. It is simply outrageous that the code by which we live - the Bible - is currently dwarfed by the code by which we are taxed. In fact, the American people are currently spending more than 6 billion hours filing their taxes and nearly $170 billion just to comply with needlessly confusing tax rules every single year. Meanwhile, our business tax rates are keeping new jobs from being created here at home and forcing more companies to stay overseas. This is downright unacceptable, and to do nothing is to endorse this unfair and unaffordable status quo.
"The debate and discussion about tax reform's ultimate form will continue to play out beyond today. I look forward to both participating in that process and listening to feedback - especially from my constituents in Western Pennsylvania - about how we can build on today's first draft. One thing is clear right now: a simpler tax code will mean a stronger economy, which in turn will mean new jobs, higher pay, and more money in the pockets of American families and workers. This is an outcome our country deserves and is worth fighting to realize.
"Along with the rest of my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, I strongly commend Chairman Camp for producing today's discussion draft. His dedicated leadership has paved the way for tax reform to finally become a reality and will continue to be vital through the work we have ahead."
NOTE:
Based on analysis by the independent, non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), without increasing the budget deficit, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 would create up to 1.8 million new private sector jobs; allow roughly 95 percent of tax-filers to get the lowest possible tax rate by simply claiming the standard deduction (no longer necessary to itemize and track receipts); and increased Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by up to $3.4 trillion (the equivalent of 20 percent of today's economy).Based on Ways and Means Committee calculations using data provided by JCT, an average middle-income family of four could retain an additional $1,300 per year.
Rep. Kelly Defends Free Speech Against New IRS Crackdown
on House Floor
Supports 'Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act'
WATCH HERE
On Thursday, Rep. Kelly spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of
H.R. 3865 , the
Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014 , which would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from implementing its proposed new regulation on tax-exempt organizations (which would effectively stifle the political activity of many critics of the Obama administration) for one year. The bill was considered as part of "Stop Government Abuse Week 2.0" and was passed by the House later that day by a bipartisan vote of 243-176.
Highlights from floor speech:
"It's rather chilling that 223 years ago our First Amendment rights were enshrined in our Bill of Rights ... I'm hearing now dollar signs and dollar numbers [across the aisle] ... saying, 'Well we can't afford to spend this kind of money [to stop discriminatory IRS rules].' Never before in America have we ever worried about the cost of money when it comes to defending our freedoms and liberties under our Constitution and our Bill of Rights. It has no dollar attached to it. It is basically, fundamentally American."
"And when we talk about the American citizens not being able to talk that way... the First Amendment, by the way, protects them and enshrines them - 45 words in the First Amendment that protect and enshrine our rights. This is not about a political issue. This is not about an 'R' or 'D,' it's about a 'we.' This is about the entire country."
"We cannot allow the voice of the people not to be heard in our town squares and when they need to speak out, they need to know that they can speak out without being threatened, without being worried about what's going to happen to them. This is so basically who we are as Americans. It has nothing to do with Republicans and Democrats, Independents and Libertarians. It has to do with who we are. If we cannot see that, and [instead] turn this into a political agenda and talking points, then, my gosh, how far we have fallen from what the Founders intended in the very beginning."
"[H.R.] 3865 reconfirms what the American people need to know: they can speak out on anything, anytime, anywhere they want without having to be worried about anybody interfering with them - especially a government."
"This is a government that serves the people. This is not a people that serve the government. ... Again, the voice of the American people has got to be heard. I don't care - conservative, liberal - I don't care where you're coming from. You have the right to speak out any time you want."
Rep. Kelly Calls Out Harry Reid
for Attacking Integrity
of Obamacare Victims
Senate Majority Leader denounced "all" negative stories
about health care law
as "untrue"
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Thursday in response to the false claim
made on Wednesday in a floor speech
by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) that in regard to the "horror stories being told" about the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), "All of them are untrue."
"Just when I thought the Leader of the Senate couldn't possibly become more out of touch with the American people, he regrettably proves me wrong. By claiming that all of the tragic stories currently unfolding from coast are coast due to Obamacare are somehow fake, Harry Reid is attacking the integrity of countless victims of a terrible law that he helped force onto a country that never wanted it. Having heard from so many of my constituents about the personal consequences that the health care law is having on their lives, I cannot help but find Mr. Reid's remarks profoundly insulting. Perhaps if he truly believes what he has said, he could pick up the phone and console those in my District injured by the law - from a mother and daughter in Hermitage to a small business owner in Fairview to a waitress in Butler - and convince them that all their higher premiums, reduced hours, and cancelled plans are just the products of their imagination. Otherwise, he should reconsider his offensive charge and confront the brutal effects that Obamacare is having on our nation and work with my colleagues to forge a solution."
