ICYMI: Heller, Begich Join Veterans
Group to Call for Repeal of Military
Retirement Cuts
(Washington, D.C.)
In a
bipartisan call for total repeal of the
military retirement cuts included in last
months budget, U.S. Senators Dean
Heller (R-NV)and Mark Begich (D-AK) joined
veterans, military families and the Iraq
and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)
at a press
conferenceTuesdaymorning. The
press conference occurred just ahead of a
Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on
adjustments to COLAs for military retirees
andTuesdaynights State
of the Union Address.
Both Heller and Begich are members of
the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
Heller and Begich joined IAVA CEO and
founder Paul Rieckhoff to call for a repeal
of the military COLA cut. On hand were
military families and veterans who could be
affected by the cuts.
Our nations heroes and
their families have made incredible
sacrifices and we owe them our full
support. When Congress approved cuts to
their cost-of-living adjustment, the very
people responsible for protecting these
important benefits actually jeopardized
them. It is an honor to join with IAVA,
veterans and military families in a
bipartisan call of support for repealing
military retirement cuts," said Senator
Dean Heller .

Ive said many times that
we shouldnt be balancing this budget
on the backs of our military men and women
who have served and sacrificed for this
country, said
Sen. Begich . I continue to
hear from veterans back home in Alaska
about the damage this cut will do to them
and their families which is why Im
fully committed to repealing it. It is my
hope that we can achieve a bipartisan
compromise that fulfils the promise we have
made to our veterans over the years and to
whom we owe a great debt. I thank the IAVA
for their continued advocacy of this issue
and am glad to stand side by side with them
today to tell Congress to keep that
promise.
Congress is breaking
Americas promise with our men and
women in uniform. These military retirement
cuts are unprecedented and
outrageous.Tomorrowon Capitol
Hill, Congress and the President will hear
directly from veterans and military
families who are affected by these
cuts, said IAVA Founder and CEO
Paul Rieckhoff . They can look
our members in the eyes and explain why
they voted for a 20 percent decrease in
their earned benefits in a time of war. In
the State of the Union, veterans expect to
hear the President clearly state that he
stands with us in opposition to these cuts.
We need his support in pressuring Congress
to fix this immediately. Our troops
overseas in the combat zone are watching
this issue closely. This is not the time
for the President to be silent.
Decembers bipartisan budget
agreement included the cuts to military
retirees. Since then, groups like the IAVA,
the American Legion and others have fought
for a total repeal of the retirement cuts,
arguing that Congress shouldnt
balance the budget on the backs of those
who have already sacrificed the most.
