Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the

Kansas Common Sense
May 11, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. It was a productive week on Capitol
Hill. Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
The Senate Passes a Budget
During my first speech as a United States Senator, I noted that one of
the greatest concerns facing our nation is our countrys out-of-control
spending. Now, for the first time since 2009, the Senate has passed a
budget and set us on a path toward fiscal responsibility. By focusing
on pro-growth policy and responsible regulatory reform, this budget
will balance the budget in 10 years and potentially create one million
new jobs according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Kansas households and businesses have long understood that they must
operate on a budget and they have expected their government to do the
same. However, for the past six years Congress failed in one of its
most basic responsibilities
drafting and passing a budget. By
returning to regular order and establishing guidelines for future
spending, this budget will set the stage for a stronger and more
prosperous America. While there is more work to be done and debate to
be had, it is encouraging to see the Senate working again.
Senate Passage of Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act
On Thursday, the Senate passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act by
a vote of 98 to 1. As the United States government seeks to limit the
risk of a nuclear Iran, the safety and security of America and our
allies are at risk. Given the gravity of this global threat, it has
been troubling to see President Obama seek to act unilaterally and
evade Congressional oversight.
While I believe the Senate should have done more to strengthen the bill
and demand accountability from Iran, this legislation provides the only
opportunity for Americans to review the nuclear agreement and have
their voices heard. Congress must impose oversight and prevent the
president from committing the United States to a potentially dangerous
nuclear deal.
Hearing on Rural Health Care
On Thursday, I participated in a Senate Appropriations Health
Subcommittee Hearing on rural health issues. I am a member of this
subcommittee, which has funding jurisdiction over most agencies within
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that impact hospitals
and others providers. Much of the hearing focused on the burdens
Washington policies place on health care providers as they work to care
for patients in Kansas and other parts of rural America. I was honored
to invite a Kansas hospital administrator
George Stover, CEO at
Hospital District #1 of Rice County in Lyons
to testify as a witness
at this hearing. Rice County Hospital, which originally opened in 1959,
is a 25 bed Critical Access Hospital (CAH) that employs around 150
individuals and serves the North Central Kansas community that has a
population of nearly 3,800. CAHs are small, rural hospitals classified
particularly classified under Medicare to receive an enhanced
reimbursement for providing care in rural areas. Eighty-four of Kansas
127 community hospitals are CAHs.
During this hearing, I asked questions about a range of health care
issues impacting Kansas and other rural states, including:
*	What the federal government is doing to prevent rural hospital
closures, determine the reasons for such closures, and evaluate the
impact hospital closures have on access to health care in their
communities.
*	Concerns that the federal government does not sufficiently
reimburse CAHs for significant expenses required to care for rural
populations.
*	Burdensome paperwork requirements for Medicare home health
services that are causing confusion among physicians, home health
agencies, and beneficiaries
Thank you to Mr. Stover for testifying at this hearing on behalf of
Kansas patients and health care providers. His insight was very much
appreciated. Click here
to watch my discussions at this hearing.
Meeting with New Postmaster General
This week, I joined a group of senators representing rural states to
host a discussion with the new Postal Service Postmaster General Megan
Brennan. I shared with the Postmaster General many of the stories Ive
heard from Kansans in letters, phone calls and town hall meetings about
slow or unreliable postal service. To be heard on these issues of
critical importance to our communities, its necessary for Republicans
and Democrats with aligned rural interests to work together and
ultimately bring about the best possible policies for our respective
states. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues to improve
the service and financial health at the USPS. Click here

Washington Post story about the conversation.
Celebrating GM's 500 Millionth Vehicle Globally at KCK Assembly Plant
Before flying back to Washington on Monday, I gave remarks at the
General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas City, Kansas, to
celebrate the completion of GM's 500 millionth vehicle globally. I
enjoyed visiting with GM CEO Mary Barra, as well as the factory
workers, company managers, and loyal customers at the event. The
Fairfax plant has produced more than 12 million vehicles since
production began in 1945, and today reportedly produces one vehicle
every 58 seconds. GM recently completed $600 million in improvements to
the assembly plant, which employs 3,500 hourly and salaried employees.
I was pleased to hear the company plans to invest another $174 million
in the near future. Thanks to UAW Local 31 President Vicki Hale for
representing automobile workers and for her organizations commitment
to improve the lives of working men and women.
Crop Insurance Professional Association (CIPA) Annual Meeting
This week, I spoke at the Crop Insurance Professional Association
(CIPA) Annual Meeting in Kansas City. CIPA is committed to maintaining
and strengthening the safety net for American farmers and ranchers
through a strong Federal Crop Insurance Program. There were more than
100 crop insurance agents and company representatives from across
Kansas and the country.
Without crop insurance, not only would farmers be at the mercy of the
weather each year to keep their livelihood, but some wouldnt even be
able to get an operating loan from their local bank. As farmers faced
tough decisions this spring on what Farm Bill commodity program to
choose, I know many of them look to agents for trusted wisdom and
counsel. I will continue to be engaged and on the forefront of farm
policy and crop insurance discussions as the Chairman of the
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. I appreciate the service
agents do for farmers and ranchers in Kansas and enjoyed the
opportunity to visit with their group.
Kansas Listening Tour in Butler County
I continued my listening tour on Saturday with a stop at the Andover
City Library. Thanks to the more than 75 Kansans who made time to
attend. Topics discussed ranged from trade and education to the budget
and national debt. Special thanks to City Administrator Mark Netter for
arranging the meeting. Thanks also to Butler Community College
President Kim Krull, City Council President Kris Estes, City Council
members Sheri Geisler and Caroline Hale, and State Senator Ty Masterson
for joining me.
D-J Engineering
I toured D-J Engineering in Augusta on Saturday, and saw first-hand how
they support the aerospace industry with highly technical engineering
and manufacturing services. Here, I'm pictured with D-J Engineering
Owner Rezaul Chowdhury, Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet, and D-J
Engineering employees James Rowley and Bill Rohner. Thanks also to
State Representatives Kristey Williams, Bud Estes and Travis
Couture-Lovelady for joining the visit.
Internships
Thank you to our spring 2015 interns: Victoria Lee and Paige Hungate of
Wichita and Brian Ard of El Dorado. Their efforts this spring benefited
many Kansans across our state, particularly those who visited and
received a Capitol Tour through our office. These individuals were a
great asset during their time here, and I have no doubt each one of
them has a bright future ahead.
I was also happy to meet a number of students from the University of
Kansas who are interning at various organizations in Washington, D.C.
this spring. It was nice to discuss the direction of our country and
how to address the important issues we currently face. It is inspiring
to see young students so enthusiastic about improving our state and
country.
The deadline for fall internship applications is quickly approaching,
and anyone interested should submit their application before Friday,
June 26. Application forms can be obtained and completed under the
Services section of Sen. Morans website at www.moran.senate.gov.
Applicants should submit a completed application form, resume, academic
transcript, two letters of recommendation and a cover letter explaining
the applicants interest in public service and goals of serving as an
intern. Please submit required materials to:
internships@moran.senate.gov
For questions, please contact Sen. Morans office at
internships@moran.senate.gov or call 202-224-6521 and request to speak
with the Intern Coordinator.
Kansas State Universitys 2nd Annual "Rhapsody!" Concert
Over the weekend, Robba and I attended K-States 2nd Annual "Rhapsody!"
Concert at Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts Helzberg Hall. The
event featured the Kansas State University Grand Chorus with
professional orchestra, KSU Concert Choir, KSU InAChord and special
guest alumna Jan Kraybill, Conservator of the Julia Irene Kauffman
Casavant organ. Proceeds benefit scholarships and performance
opportunities for Kansas State University students. It was good to
catch up with K-State President Kirk Schulz and his wife Noel at the
event.
Teacher Appreciation Week
Honoring Elouise Miller
During Teacher Appreciation Week, special thanks to all the teachers
who care deeply about their students and challenge them to reach their
goals. Just last week, Elouise Miller, a teacher who taught in the USD
489 school district for 60 years, passed away. Elouise was
well-respected by administrators, fellow teachers, parents and
students. She was considered a mentor not only as an educator, but also
for her lifestyle and care and concern for kids and people in general.

Giving Remarks at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association
This week, I gave remarks to more than 1,000 members of the National
Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA). Despite the challenges
posed by an ever-growing number of burdensome federal regulations, the
NRECA works to support the interests of electric cooperatives and the
consumers they serve.

The
Senate
Passes
a
Budget
During
my
first
speech
as
a
United
States
Senator,
I
noted
that
one
of
the
greatest
concerns
facing
our
nation
is
our
country&#146;s
out-of-control
spending.
Now,
for
the
first
time
since
2009,
the
Senate
has
passed
a
budget
and
set
us
on
a
path
toward
fiscal
responsibility.
By
focusing
on
pro-growth
policy
and
responsible
regulatory
reform,
this
budget
will
balance
the
budget
in
10
years
and
potentially
create
one
million
new
jobs
according
to
the
nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget
Office.
Kansas
households
and
businesses
have
long
understood
that
they
must
operate
on
a
budget
and
they
have
expected
their
government
to
do
the
same.
However,
for
the
past
six
years
Congress
failed
in
one
of
its
most
basic
responsibilities
&#150;
drafting
and
passing
a
budget.
By
returning
to
regular
order
and
establishing
guidelines
for
future
spending,
this
budget
will
set
the
stage
for
a
stronger
and
more
prosperous
America.
While
there
is
more
work
to
be
done
and
debate
to
be
had,
it
is
encouraging
to
see
the
Senate
working
again.
Senate
Passage
of
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
On
Thursday,
the
Senate
passed
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
by
a
vote
of
98
to
1.
As
the
United
States
government
seeks
to
limit
the
risk
of
a
nuclear
Iran,
the
safety
and
security
of
America
and
our
allies
are
at
risk.
Given
the
gravity
of
this
global
threat,
it
has
been
troubling
to
see
President
Obama
seek
to
act
unilaterally
and
evade
Congressional
oversight.
While
I
believe
the
Senate
should
have
done
more
to
strengthen
the
bill
and
demand
accountability
from
Iran,
this
legislation
provides
the
only
opportunity
for
Americans
to
review
the
nuclear
agreement
and
have
their
voices
heard.
Congress
must
impose
oversight
and
prevent
the
president
from
committing
the
United
States
to
a
potentially
dangerous
nuclear
deal.
Hearing
on
Rural
Health
Care
On
Thursday,
I
participated
in
a
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee
Hearing
on
rural
health
issues.
I
am
a
member
of
this
subcommittee,
which
has
funding
jurisdiction
over
most
agencies
within
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
that
impact
hospitals
and
others
providers.
Much
of
the
hearing
focused
on
the
burdens
Washington
policies
place
on
health
care
providers
as
they
work
to
care
for
patients
in
Kansas
and
other
parts
of
rural
America.
I
was
honored
to
invite
a
Kansas
hospital
administrator
&#150;
George
Stover,
CEO
at
Hospital
District
#1
of
Rice
County
in
Lyons
&#150;
to
testify
as
a
witness
at
this
hearing.
Rice
County
Hospital,
which
originally
opened
in
1959,
is
a
25
bed
Critical
Access
Hospital
(CAH)
that
employs
around
150
individuals
and
serves
the
North
Central
Kansas
community
that
has
a
population
of
nearly
3,800.
CAHs
are
small,
rural
hospitals
classified
particularly
classified
under
Medicare
to
receive
an
enhanced
reimbursement
for
providing
care
in
rural
areas.
Eighty-four
of
Kansas&#146;
127
community
hospitals
are
CAHs.
During
this
hearing,
I
asked
questions
about
a
range
of
health
care
issues
impacting
Kansas
and
other
rural
states,
including:
What
the
federal
government
is

the
reasons
for
such

the
impact
hospital

have

access

health

Concerns

Thank
you
to

Meeting
with
New
Postmaster
General
This
week,
I
joined
a
group
of
senators
representing
rural
states
to
host
a
discussion
with
the
new
Postal
Service
Postmaster
General
Megan
Brennan.
I
shared
with
the
Postmaster
General
many
of
the
stories
I&#146;ve
heard
from
Kansans
in
letters,
phone
calls
and
town
hall
meetings
about
slow
or
unreliable
postal
service.
To
be
heard
on
these
issues
of
critical
importance
to
our
communities,
it&#146;s
necessary
for
Republicans
and
Democrats
with
aligned
rural
interests
to
work
together
and
ultimately
bring
about
the
best
possible
policies
for
our
respective
states.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
Senate
colleagues
to
improve
the
service
and
financial
health
at
the
USPS.

Celebrating
GM's
500
Millionth
Vehicle
Globally
at
KCK
Assembly
Plant
Before
flying
back
to
Washington
on
Monday,
I
gave
remarks
at
the
General
Motors
Fairfax
Assembly
Plant
in
Kansas
City,
Kansas,
to
celebrate
the
completion
of
GM's
500
millionth
vehicle
globally.
I
enjoyed
visiting
with
GM
CEO
Mary
Barra,
as
well
as
the
factory
workers,
company
managers,
and
loyal
customers
at
the
event.
The
Fairfax
plant
has
produced
more
than
12
million
vehicles
since
production
began
in
1945,
and
today
reportedly
produces
one
vehicle
every
58
seconds.
GM
recently
completed
$600
million
in
improvements
to
the
assembly
plant,
which
employs
3,500
hourly
and
salaried
employees.
I
was
pleased
to
hear
the
company
plans
to
invest
another
$174
million
in
the
near
future.
Thanks
to
UAW
Local
31
President
Vicki
Hale
for
representing
automobile
workers
and
for
her
organization&#146;s
commitment
to
improve
the
lives
of
working
men
and
women.
Crop
Insurance
Professional
Association
(CIPA)
Annual
Meeting
This
week,
I
spoke
at
the
Crop
Insurance
Professional
Association
(CIPA)
Annual
Meeting
in
Kansas
City.
CIPA
is
committed
to
maintaining
and
strengthening
the
safety
net
for
American
farmers
and
ranchers
through
a
strong
Federal
Crop
Insurance
Program.
There
were
more
than
100
crop
insurance
agents
and
company
representatives
from
across
Kansas
and
the
country.
Without
crop
insurance,
not
only
would
farmers
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
weather
each
year
to
keep
their
livelihood,
but
some
wouldn&#146;t
even
be
able
to
get
an
operating
loan
from
their
local
bank.
As
farmers
faced
tough
decisions
this
spring
on
what
Farm
Bill
commodity
program
to
choose,
I
know
many
of
them
look
to
agents
for
trusted
wisdom
and
counsel.
I
will
continue
to
be
engaged
and
on
the
forefront
of
farm
policy
and
crop
insurance
discussions
as
the
Chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee.
I
appreciate
the
service
agents
do
for
farmers
and
ranchers
in
Kansas
and
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
their
group.
Kansas
Listening
Tour
in
Butler
County
I
continued
my
listening
tour
on
Saturday
with
a

at
the
Andover
City
Library.
Thanks
to
the
more
than
75
Kansans
who
made
time
to
attend.
Topics
discussed
ranged
from
trade
and
education
to
the
budget
and
national
debt.
Special
thanks
to
City

Mark
Netter
for
arranging
the
meeting.
Thanks
also
to
Butler
Community
College
President
Kim
Krull,
City
Council
President
Kris
Estes,
City
Council
members
Sheri
Geisler
and
Caroline
Hale,
and
State

Ty
Masterson
for

me.
D-J
Engineering
I
toured
D-J
Engineering
in
Augusta
on
Saturday,
and
saw
first-hand
how
they
support
the
aerospace
industry
with
highly
technical
engineering
and
manufacturing
services.
Here,
I'm
pictured
with
D-J
Engineering
Owner
Rezaul
Chowdhury,
Butler
County
Sheriff
Kelly
Herzet,
and
D-J
Engineering
employees
James
Rowley
and
Bill
Rohner.
Thanks
also
to
State
Representatives
Kristey
Williams,
Bud
Estes
and
Travis
Couture-Lovelady
for
joining
the

Internships
Thank
you
to
our
spring
2015
interns:
Victoria
Lee
and
Paige
Hungate
of
Wichita
and
Brian
Ard
of
El
Dorado.
Their
efforts
this
spring
benefited
many
Kansans
across
our
state,
particularly
those
who
visited
and
received
a
Capitol
Tour
through
our
office.
These
individuals
were
a
great
asset
during
their
time
here,
and
I
have
no
doubt
each
one
of
them
has
a
bright
future
ahead.
I
was
also
happy
to
meet
a
number
of
students
from
the
University
of
Kansas
who
are
interning
at
various
organizations
in
Washington,
D.C.
this
spring.
It
was
nice
to
discuss
the
direction
of
our
country
and
how
to
address
the
important
issues
we
currently
face.
It
is
inspiring
to
see
young
students
so
enthusiastic
about
improving
our
state
and
country.

Teacher
Appreciation
Week
&#150;
Honoring
Elouise
Miller
During
Teacher
Appreciation
Week,
special
thanks
to
all
the
teachers
who
care
deeply
about
their
students
and
challenge
them
to
reach
their
goals.
Just
last
week,
Elouise
Miller,
a
teacher
who
taught
in
the
USD
489
school
district
for
60
years,
passed
away.
Elouise
was
well-respected
by
administrators,
fellow
teachers,
parents
and
students.
She
was
considered
a
mentor
not
only
as
an
educator,
but
also
for
her
lifestyle
and
care
and
concern
for
kids
and
people
in
general.

week,
I
gave

to
more
than

Despite
the
