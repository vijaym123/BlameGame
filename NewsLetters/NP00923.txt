Ross Delivers UCF Commencement Speech
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 7, 2015
U.S. Rep. Dennis A. Ross (R-FL-15), Senior Deputy Majority Whip, delivered a graduation commencement speech at the University of Central Florida (UCF) today. Speaking to graduates of the College of Health and Public Affairs, Ross congratulated the graduates on their great achievements and reminded them to persevere when challenges present themselves in the future.
During my lifetime, I have learned that success can also be measured by failures. Thats because your failures dont define yourather, they help you learn and grow along the way. Through perseverance, independent thinking, maintaining a sense of humor, and humility, we can overcome all failures and turn them into success.
A college degree provides a leg up in this world, and our country is going to rely on these fine graduates and future leaders of tomorrow to strengthen our nations economy, to mend our healthcare system, to improve our schools, and to help our fellow Americans and friends across the globe. I congratulate these graduates today and all other Class of 2015 UCF graduates on their great accomplishments and determination.
Go Knights!
