Memorial Day: May We Never Forget
Dear Friends,
This Memorial Day, many across our district will enjoy a day off from
work - perhaps spent at a patriotic parade or picnic with family and
friends. But no matter where we are, we will all be enjoying the
blessings of liberty thanks to the brave men and women who fought to
keep us safe. Today, we pause to honor those who laid down their lives
in defense of freedom and in the name of the country that they loved.
This weekend, my office will be in attendance at Memorial Day
remembrance events across the district, ranging from Gallatin, to
Manchester, to Crossville, to Smithville. We look forward to seeing
many of you there and joining with you to honor these hometown heroes.
In reflecting on their sacrifices, I am always reminded of a famous
saying of President Ronald Reagan which hangs on a placard in my
office: "Freedom is never more than one generation away from
extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. It
must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same."
Our men and women in uniform have heeded that call and we should follow
their example. I hope you will join with me in remembering with solemn
gratitude the American heroes who gave their lives to protect the
liberties we hold dear, in praying for the families they left behind,
and in teaching our children and grandchildren an appreciation and
respect for their service. May each of us do our part to ensure that
freedom is carried on for the next generation.
>From our family to yours, Happy Memorial Day!
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress

But
no

we
will
all

liberty
thanks
to
the
brave
men
and

Today,
we
pause

We

In

I
am
