Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This week, a preliminary report on the state of affairs at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) confirmed that there are widespread
and systematic problems within the VA.
While the VA in Phoenix was reporting an average wait time of 24 days
for an initial primary care appointment, the inspector general found
that based on a sampling of patients, the average wait time was
actually 115 days. It was also found that fraudulent scheduling
procedures were being used at dozens of VA facilities across the
country.
In this regard, the resignation of Department of Veterans Affairs
Secretary Eric Shinseki, while warranted given that these problems have
continued to grow under his watch, does not fix the problem. As the
Wall Street Journal pointed out on Friday, the VA bureaucracy has
developed a perverse culture in which senior managers and practitioners
are immune from any performance accountability and, indeed, are
rewarded with thousands of dollars in bonuses irrespective of
performance.
Accountability is desperately needed.
Unfortunately,
Senator Harry Reid is currently blocking the House-passed VA Management
Accountability Act from coming to a vote in the Senate.
The Department of Homeland Security recently provided details of the
more than 36,000 illegal immigrant criminal convicts who have been
released into society, rather than be deported, by ICE. The crimes
committed by these illegal immigrants include murder, rape, arson,
extortion, kidnapping, aggravated assault, domestic violence, and
larceny. These releases represent a clear threat to public safety.
At a hearing before the Judiciary Committee yesterday, Homeland
Security Secretary Jeh Johnson took questions from the Committee about
the mass release of criminals into American society. Watch my
questioning by clicking here.
How can someone who is not even lawfully in our country commit serious
felonies and yet be allowed to remain in our society - and potentially
threaten the lives, liberties and property of the American people? How
can ICE turn a blind eye toward an illegal immigrant who has exhibited
a pattern of reckless conduct - such as racking up multiple convictions
for DUI? If foreign countries will not take back their criminal
nationals, why won't the State Department follow existing law and
suspend visas to that country until they take responsibility?
Finally, this week saw a positive development for maintaining internet
freedom.
During consideration of the annual Commerce-Justice-Science
appropriations bill, the House passed an amendment to prohibit funds
from being used by the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration to relinquish to foreign actors important internet
responsibilities.
If adopted by the Senate and signed into law, this
provision would essentially prohibit the Obama administration from
allowing countries like Russia and China, as well as international
bureaucracies such as the United Nations, to exert control over the
internet.
There is nothing positive that could come if such a scenario
were permitted to occur.
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week,
a
preliminary
report
on
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
confirmed
that
there
are
widespread
and
systematic
problems
within
the
VA.
While
the
VA
in
Phoenix
was
reporting
an
average
wait
time
of
24
days
for
an
initial
primary
care
appointment,
the
inspector
general
found
that
based
on
a
sampling
of
patients,
the
average
wait
time
was
actually
115
days.
It
was
also
found
that
fraudulent
scheduling
procedures
were
being
used
at
dozens
of
VA
facilities
across
the
country.
In
this
regard,
the
resignation
of
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki,
while
warranted
given
that
these
problems
have
continued
to
grow
under
his
watch,
does
not
fix
the
problem.
As
the
Wall
Street
Journal
pointed
out
on
Friday,
the
VA
bureaucracy
has
developed
a
perverse
culture
in
which
senior
managers
and
practitioners
are
immune
from
any
performance
accountability
and,
indeed,
are
rewarded
with
thousands
of
dollars
in
bonuses
irrespective
of
performance.
Accountability
is
desperately
needed.
Unfortunately,
Senator
Harry
Reid
is
currently
blocking
the
House-passed
VA
Management
Accountability
Act
from
coming
to
a
vote
in
the
Senate.
The
Department
of
Homeland
Security
recently
provided
details
of
the
more
than
36,000
illegal
immigrant
criminal
convicts
who
have
been
released
into
society,
rather
than
be
deported,
by
ICE.
The
crimes
committed
by
these
illegal
immigrants
include
murder,
rape,
arson,
extortion,
kidnapping,
aggravated
assault,
domestic
violence,
and
larceny.
These
releases
represent
a
clear
threat
to
public
safety.
At
a
hearing
before
the
Judiciary
Committee
yesterday,
Homeland
Security
Secretary
Jeh
Johnson
took
questions
from
the
Committee
about
the
mass
release
of
criminals
into
American
society.
Watch
my
questioning
by
clicking
here.
How
can
someone
who
is
not
even
lawfully
in
our
country
commit
serious
felonies
and
yet
be
allowed
to
remain
in
our
society
&#8211;
and
potentially
threaten
the
lives,
liberties
and
property
of
the
American
people?
How
can
ICE
turn
a
blind
eye
toward
an
illegal
immigrant
who
has
exhibited
a
pattern
of
reckless
conduct
&#8211;
such
as
racking
up
multiple
convictions
for
DUI?
If
foreign
countries
will
not
take
back
their
criminal
nationals,
why
won&#8217;t
the
State
Department
follow
existing
law
and
suspend
visas
to
that
country
until
they
take
responsibility?
Finally,
this
week
saw
a
positive
development
for
maintaining
internet
freedom.
During
consideration
of
the
annual
Commerce-Justice-Science
appropriations
bill,
the
House
passed
an
amendment
to
prohibit
funds
from
being
used
by
the
National
Telecommunications
and
Information
Administration
to
relinquish
to
foreign
actors
important
internet
responsibilities.
If
adopted
by
the
Senate
and
signed
into
law,
this
provision
would
essentially
prohibit
the
Obama
administration
from
allowing
countries
like
Russia
and
China,
as
well
as
international
bureaucracies
such
as
the
United
Nations,
to
exert
control
over
the
internet.
There
is
nothing
positive
that
could
come
if
such
a
scenario
were
permitted
to
occur.
