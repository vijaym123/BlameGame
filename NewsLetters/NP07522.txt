Dear
Friend,
Im continuing my efforts to hold the
Veterans Administration accountable to ensure that our vets are getting the
proper care they deserve. Weve recently learned of troubling
reports, both from whistleblowers and from an internal VA audit, about
misconduct within the Philadelphia VA Claims
Office.
What did they find? Dozens of boxes full of ignored mail from
veterans, discarded and maybe destroyed. Employees manipulating data to make
wait times appear shorter
and then pressured whistleblowers to
prevent them from coming forward.
During a recent
hearing in Washington, D.C., I had the opportunity to speak to
whistleblowers from the Philadelphia VA.
Here
you can see that we discussed some of the issues the
Philadelphia facility has been experiencing.
Along
with my colleague Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (PA-08), I wrote to VA
Undersecretary Allison Hickey about the reports of mail from veterans being
destroyed across the country. Rep. Fitzpatrick and I are going to
continue working to investigate this pattern of concealed or destroyed
mail from veterans, particularly in our region. To read more about
this, click

Photos obtained from a
whistleblower at the Philadelphia VA Regional Office showing boxes of
ignored and unread letters from veterans from 2008 and
2009.
Sincerely,
Congressman Pat Meehan
