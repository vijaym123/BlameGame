Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
How about these unbelievable Kentucky wildcats! The men won an
incredible and hard-fought victory Saturday, and I can't wait to watch
them take on the Wolverines tonight.
And the LadyCats were every bit as impressive on Saturday, even without
reprising their multiple-overtime December victory over the Baylor
Bears.
We are all proud of the Cats and wish them all continued success. And I
especially look forward to Representative John Yarmuth fulfilling his
side of our wager with some of Louisville's finest bourbon.
Addressing Our Nation's Debt
On Tuesday, I attended a hearing of the Financial Services Committee
regarding the importance of addressing our nation's debt crisis
entitled, "Why Debt Matters." As I travel around central and eastern
Kentucky, people consistently tell me that restoring fiscal
responsibility is their top priority.
And the reason is simple: Kentuckians are smart. Kentuckians know that
it's a problem that the federal government spends significantly more
than it takes in; they know that Washington's spending problem only
gets worse the longer we delay honestly confronting it; and they know
that future generations will have to work longer and harder in order to
receive less as they shoulder the burden of debt that our federal
government is now creating.
It is time to get Washington's out-of-control spending under control
and stop allowing politicians to spend money today only to worry about
how to pay for it tomorrow.
That is why I have introduced H.R. 4021, the Debt Limit Reform and
Congressional Pay for Performance Act of 2014, legislation to change
the way Washington works by advancing a new, much-needed solution that
will hold politicians accountable, promote economic growth and job
creation, and restrain future spending without threatening default on
past obligations.
Signature Industry Spotlight: Celebrating Kentucky Agriculture
On Tuesday, we celebrated National Agriculture Day to help spread the
word about the critical role agriculture plays in providing safe,
abundant and affordable products.
Thank you to all the farmers that work endlessly to provide almost
everything we eat, use and wear on a daily basis!

Advancing Commonsense Solutions for Kentucky Communities
On Wednesday, I was glad to meet with Ms. Sarah Butler and Commissioner
Charles Vice of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions to
discuss the regulatory environment and ways we can improve access to
credit in places like Bath County.
I appreciate the Commissioner's
support of my legislation, H.R. 2672, the Helping Expand Lending
Practices in Rural Communities Act of 2014, which would establish
needed flexibility for community banks seeking to serve rural
communities.

aid, and higher education benefits.
Daniel Weber, a graduate student at the University of Kentucky College
of Agriculture, visited my office to talk about the importance of
funding to the Agricultural Research Service and the Agriculture & Food
Research Institute, which supports important agricultural research
projects.
Susan Swinford and Croswell Chambers from Hospice of the Bluegrass
Lexington, KY were kind enough to visit me in Washington and share the
challenges they face from new reporting requirements and reimbursement
procedures, as well as all of the wonderful work they do in our
community.
I would like to thank the American Association of Physicians of Indian
Origin (AAPI) for inviting Congressman Ami Bera, MD and me to speak at
their Washington, D.C. fly-in about the bipartisan healthcare reform we
introduced.
I was pleased to meet with members of the American Legion Auxiliary of

Vice President of the Man O'War Unit # 8 lodge, for her dedication to
serve veterans in the Lexington area.
I am honored that the Healthcare Leadership Council (HLC) named me a

organizations for their support of my legislation, the Saving Lives,
Saving Costs Act.
