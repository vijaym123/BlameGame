Dear
Friend,
I recently recorded a message
honoring the 50th Anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act. The
video has been nominated for "Best Video" as part of a friendly
competition here in the House of Representatives.
Will you please take a
minute to like or share the video on Facebook right
now ?

The Civil Rights Act was one of the
most important pieces of legislation enacted in the 20th century. Its
passage is a shining example of what Congress can do when we work
together.
Please help me
share this message with other with a
like or
share
right now!
Thank
you!
Sincerely,
