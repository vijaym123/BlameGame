Congressman Lamborn Supports
Restarting the H-2B Visa
Program
3/13/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn issued the following statement regarding the H-2B
Visa Program. After a recent legal development, the Department of
Homeland Security and the Department of Labor have suspended issuing H-2B
Visas. These Visas are designed to allow foreign workers to address
temporary or seasonal work needs in the United
States.
The H-2B visa program is an
important piece of our system of legal immigration. It is totally off the
mark for the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security
to arbitrarily suspend these visas due to an ongoing legal case. The
actions by these departments will harm the Colorado economy and I urge
them to reconsider their drastic and seemingly arbitrary steps. I also
encourage the relevant agencies and the executive branch to work
towards reforming and streamlining our system of legal immigration. The
legal immigration system should be one that discourages illegal
immigration, not one that punishes people trying to play by the
rules.
