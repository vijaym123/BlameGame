Dear
Friends,
I have met with many of you these past
few weeks, and am working on and supporting several pieces of
legislation to the benefit of the people of the 14th District. Heres the
latest on how Im serving you.
Supporting Family-Owned Businesses and
Farms
Growing up in a family funeral
home, I saw first-hand the grief families endured following the death of a
parent, and I understand how important it is to protect people when
they are most vulnerable. I recently supported two efforts to that
end:
Urged
repeal of the Estate Tax (Death Tax):
The estate tax diminishes the ability of families to pass on
their lifes work to their children and grandchildren. Burdening family
farmers and small-business owners in Illinois only adds insult to
injury after a loss. Furthermore, a report by a former Congressional
Budget Office director estimated that a full repeal of the estate tax would
create 1.5 million new jobs. Along with 59 colleagues, I
sent a letter
to House Leadership urging a repeal of the tax in any
tax reform package.
Cosponsored H.R. 4213, the Funeral Rule Improvement Act of
2014 : A 1984 Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) rule was intended to forbid business practices that would
exploit the grief-stricken consumer, but a loophole made the rule only
apply to funeral homes that provide both goods and servicesfamily
funeral homes. H.R. 4213 would close the loophole and ensure that these
consumer protections would cover all businesses selling funeral goods or
services, such as cemeteries, internet sellers and retail
stores.
Connecting
Workers with 21st Century Jobs
One the greatest challenges facing the long-term unemployed
and the youth is connecting the skills and knowledge they have with the
jobs that actually exist. Many times, the jobs workers held
previously no longer exist or require advanced
training.
H.R. 4425, the Perkins
Modernization Act of 2014 , is a bill I have cosponsored that better
connects future employees and adults reentering the workforce with the
demands of an ever-evolving labor market.
Right now, the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical
Education Act of 2006 authorizes formula grants to State boards of
career and technical education (CTE) and sub grants to local education
agencies and postsecondary institutions, including community
colleges, comprehensive high schools, technical schools and community-based
organizations. This helps develop the academic, vocational, and
technical skills of future employees and adults reentering the
workforce.
By replacing language in
the Act from high skill, high wage, or high demand occupations with
employment in in-demand industry sectors or occupations, CTE will use
workforce dataincluding analysis of job openings and Department of
Labor statisticsto drive career and technical education curriculum to
meet emerging labor market demands. This will help align CTE programs
with local workforce needs and prepare workers making a transition to
a new industry or skill set for the jobs of both today and
tomorrow.
Drug Drop
Off
Prescription drug abuse
has wrecked countless lives, and careless disposal or neglect of home
medicines can exacerbate the problem. Further, the link between
prescription drugs and eventual heroin use is clear, and we must work
together as a community to lessen the danger to the young and old
alike.
(Rep.
Hultgren using new drug drop box with Kane County Coroner Rob
Russell)
I was pleased to participate
in the nationwide drug take-back effort in April which provided
Illinois residents with no-cost, anonymous collection of potentially
dangerous expired, unused and unwanted prescription medicines, including
powerful opioid painkillers.
When a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from
family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet, the
entire northern Illinois community must search their homes for these drugs
and get them out of harms way.

for information on disposing your own prescription drugs
throughout the year.
I will continue to fight to stop the epidemic of heroin and
opioid abuse. More information is available on my website at:

Preparing our Next Generation of STEM
Leaders
Our next
generation of technicians, engineers and scientists should be exposed to
careers and jobs they hadnt even considered when imagining their
futures.

D.C. which energized students and teachers and showcased the
opportunities of the future.
