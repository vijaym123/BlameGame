Dear
Friend,
The Affordable Care Act is working in terms of access,
affordability and quality. There are 10.3 million fewer uninsured people
throughout the country compared to last year. If you enrolled in a
Marketplace plan in 2014, I encourage you to go back to
HealthCare.gov
and shop for the best plan for you and your family
for 2015. You may be able to save money by switching to another
plan.
Open Enrollment for 2015 is going on now! Visit
HealthCare.gov

plan that fits your needs and budget. Whether you already have
coverage or are getting coverage for the first time, here are some important
dates and information.
