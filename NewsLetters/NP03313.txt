Lamborn Introduces Bill to Honor Slain
Army
Chaplain
1/15/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn has introduced H.R. 382, to name the post
office located at
8585 Criterion Drive in Colorado Springs after
slain Army chaplain Dale Allen Goetz. Goetz was the first Army
clergyman killed in action since the Vietnam War. Goetz was killed in August
2010 while serving his country in Afghanistan. He was riding with a
resupply convoy when the enemy attacked with an improvised explosive
near the Arghandab River Valley. Four of his fellow soldiers from Fort
Carson died with him in that attack. Goetz was serving with the 1st
Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team with the 4th
Infantry Division of Fort Carson, Colorado.
Goetz, who was
43-years old, left behind his wife, Christy, and their three young boys.
He is also survived by his mother, Hope, and his sisters, Kim Sumner
and Ann Senetar.
Note:
Abbreviated history of the Chaplain Corps from the U.S. Army National
Museum:
As long as armies have
existed, military chaplains have served alongside soldiers, providing for
their spiritual needs, working to improve morale, and aiding the
wounded. The Chaplain Corps dates back to 29 July 1775, when the Continental
Congress authorized one chaplain for each regiment of the Continental
Army, with pay equaling that of a captain. Since the War for
Independence, chaplains have served in every American war. While their duties
are primarily focused on spiritual and morale issues, many chaplains
have also demonstrated tremendous bravery. Stories abound of chaplains
administering the last rites to fallen soldiers, oblivious to the fire
around them, or dashing out into the open to rescue the wounded
without regard to their own
lives.
Captain Dale A. Goetz lived and died according to the Chaplain Corps
motto, Pro Deo Et Patria (For God and
Country).
"Chaplain Dale Goetz was a man of uncommon
faith. In 2002, he left his small congregation in South Dakota to
volunteer to serve in the Army, knowing the risks he faced. According to one
of his good friends,
'God was using him. He was very actively
witnessing. He didnt want to be just a social worker. He wanted to see
soldiers hear the Gospel and trust Christ.' His devotion, his service
to others, and his love of country were an example to
all.
"I had the honor of meeting
Dale's widow, Christy. She, too, is a person of tremendous faith. She and
her late husband are an inspiration to everyone whose lives they have
touched. I trust that the people of Colorado Springs will remember
Dale every time they enter or see this post office, and that they will
remember his patriotism, his courage, and his
faith."
