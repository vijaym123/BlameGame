About Tim
Constituent Services
News and Media
Friends,
Thanks you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
This is a great way for
me to share important news from Washington and at home.
Opportunity Through Education
Education is a crucial step between poverty and success, and I firmly
believe that every child deserves the best possible chance to reach his
or her full potential.
Through my Opportunity Agenda
and CHOICE
Act
, I have been an outspoken advocate of expanding opportunity
and school choice. Earlier this week, I was very proud to have Mr.
William Farrior of Ravenel, South Carolina, in Washington to take part
in a roundtable discussion on disability in higher education in the
Senate Education Committee.
Mr. Farrior's testimony and inspiring
story are helping to expand and inform our conversation on access.
Keeping the Promise to Our Seniors
We're all familiar with Obamacare's soaring premiums, lost coverage,
and dismal sign up numbers, but its harmful effects on Medicare
Advantage are just beginning to have real world consequences. As a
direct result of the Affordable Care Act, many seniors who rely on
Medicare Advantage-almost half of whom live on under $20,000 a year-are
seeing cut benefits and premium increases between $65 and $145 a month,
with further cuts to the program projected through 2015 likely to make
a bad situation even worse.
I have consistently opposed Obamacare and will continue in my efforts
to relieve the American people of the burden this bad law has imposed-
for our families, our small businesses, our seniors, and our
communities.
Defending Our Freedom of Speech
As a nation, free speech and press are among our highest values. The
FCC attempted a gross overreach of power when they recently proposed an
intrusive study that would have put a government official in our
newsrooms in Columbia, South Carolina, asking inappropriate questions
on editorial content and office structure that would have almost
certainly affected the independence of our news producers.
I have
taken a strong stance
from
the beginning on this matter, and am very glad that they seem to have
realized their error and cancelled the study.

letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler here

Palmetto Wednesdays
Every Wednesday when the Senate is in session
, I
invite South Carolinians to come to my office in Washington at 11 AM
for great conversations and some southern hospitality. We make plenty
of real sweet tea, put out some Lay's potato chips that were proudly
made in South Carolina, and look forward to meeting constituents.
Please contact my office at (202) 224-6121 for more information or to
let us know you'll be joining us!
Thank you for the opportunity to be your voice in Washington, and
please don't hesitate to contact my office to share your thoughts and
concerns.
Together we are working for a brighter tomorrow for South
Carolina and all Americans.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
