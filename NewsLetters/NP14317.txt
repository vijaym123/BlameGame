Dear Friends,
After honoring our nation's veterans on Monday in Austin at the Texas
State Capitol, I was back in Washington working for you.
Last week the president issued a hollow apology to Americans who lost
their health insurance after promising for years they could keep it.
Only after the threat of political defections within his own party, and
legislation proposed by Republicans that I cosponsored, the Keep Your
Health Plan Act
, that would fix the problem he created, did
the president decide he actually needed to make good on his promise.
What we heard from the president on Thursday was a reluctant, crass
political calculation, not a genuine desire to do what's right.
On Wednesday
I chaired a hearing of the Homeland Security Committee that
focused on security concerns
surrounding the Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov. The
hearing exposed what we feared: the website is not secure from cyber
hackers, and the Department of Homeland Security, which is in charge of
securing government websites, has had almost no interaction with the
Department of Health and Human Services which built the site.
While I
have long advocated for a delay in the implementation of Obamacare, at
a minimum, it should be put on hold until we can guarantee that
Americans' most sensitive information is protected.
Thursday I spearheaded a letter, and was joined by a bipartisan
coalition of 62 of my House colleagues,
to urge the Senate to hold a vote on the Nuclear Iran
Prevention Act. This legislation, that is designed to force Iran to
abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, passed the House in July by a
vote of 400-20 but has stalled in the Senate.
As negotiations in
Geneva are underway, it is important to keep the pressure on Iran to
maximize U.S. leverage. It is because of tough U.S. sanctions against
Iran that Tehran has come to the negotiating table. Security in the
Middle East and around the world depends on strong U.S. leadership
against a nuclear Iran and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.
This week I also voted for, and the House passed legislation aimed at
reducing frivolous lawsuits. H.R. 2655, The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction
Act,
is an important step forward in reducing
unnecessary and abusive litigation in America's judicial system. I am
hopeful that the Senate will follow suit and pass this important
legislation.

Dear
Friends,
After
honoring
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
on
Monday
in
Austin
at
the
Texas
State
Capitol,
I
was
back
in
Washington
working
for
you.
Last
week
the
president
issued
a
hollow
apology
to
Americans
who
lost
their
health
insurance
after
promising
for
years
they
could
keep
it.
Only
after
the
threat
of
political
defections
within
his
own
party,
and
legislation
proposed
by
Republicans
that
I
cosponsored,
the
Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act ,
that
would
fix
the
problem
he
created,
did
the
president
decide
he
actually
needed
to
make
good
on
his
promise.
What
we
heard
from
the
president
on
Thursday
was
a
reluctant,
crass
political
calculation,
not
a
genuine
desire
to
do
what's
right.
On
Wednesday
I
chaired
a
hearing
of
the
Homeland
Security
Committee
that
focused
on
security
concerns
surrounding
the
Obamacare
website,
Healthcare.gov. The
hearing
exposed
what
we
feared:
the
website
is
not
secure
from
cyber
hackers,
and
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security,
which
is
in
charge
of
securing
government
websites,
has
had
almost
no
interaction
with
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
which
built
the
site.
While
I have
long
advocated
for
a
delay
in the
implementation
of
Obamacare,
at
a
minimum,
it
should
be
put
on
hold
until
we
can
guarantee that
Americans'
most
sensitive
information
is
protected.
Thursday
I
spearheaded
a
letter,
and
was
joined
by
a
bipartisan
coalition
of
62
of
my
House
colleagues,
to
urge
the
Senate
to
hold
a
vote
on
the
Nuclear
Iran
Prevention
Act.
This
legislation,
that
is
designed
to
force
Iran
to
abandon
its
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons,
passed
the
House
in
July
by
a
vote
of
400-20
but
has
stalled
in
the
Senate.
As
negotiations
in
Geneva
are
underway,
it
is
important
to
keep
the
pressure
on
Iran
to
maximize
U.S.
leverage. It
is
because
of
tough
U.S.
sanctions
against
Iran
that
Tehran
has
come
to
the
negotiating
table.
Security
in
the
Middle
East
and
around
the
world
depends
on
strong
U.S.
leadership
against
a
nuclear
Iran
and
I
urge
the
Senate
to
pass
this
legislation.
This
week
I
also
voted
for,
and
the

passed
legislation
aimed
at
reducing
frivolous

is

in
America&#8217;s
judicial
system. I
am
hopeful
that
the
Senate
will
follow
suit
and
pass
this
important
legislation.
