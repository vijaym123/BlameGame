Blaine's Bulletin: TPA=Jobs
Since coming to Congress, one of my main priorities has been getting more people back to work. I have been a consistent supporter of legislation and ideas that will not only help get Americans back to work, but will keep more money in their pockets. So, when the House started to debate Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) earlier this month, I took a hard look at how many jobs free trade agreements create and how this will help not only those in the 3 rd
District, but Americans across our country.
As of this year, more than 39.8 million American jobs depend on trade meaning, which is one in every five. There has been a lot of misinformation floating around the media regarding TPA and I would like to set the record straight. The fast track vote, as it is commonly referred to, outlines the first step that is needed to set the process for negotiating and approving trade agreements. A vote in support of TPA shifts the power from the president and ensures that Congress and the American people have a greater role in negotiating trade agreements. Without it, the president would continue to negotiate without Congressional input and outside of the public eye. Let me make clear, under TPA, Congress retains total control over international trade authority granted to it by the U.S. Constitution. Any trade agreement negotiated by the president under TPA still must be approved separately by Congress. This is critically important, because, without TPA, Congress and the American people have less of an ability to hold the president accountable for his actions in international negotiations. There are 20 countries with trade agreements and there is a trade surplus
and with others there is a deficit.
Recently, the House considered the
Trade Act of 2015 . This legislation included over 150 provisions that would establish specific rules and objectives for international trade negotiations, and would require Congress to have ongoing access to important negotiating documents. In addition, this bill would codify into law that documents of a trade agreement must be made public for Americans to read 60 days before Congress can hold a vote on its approval.
Free trade agreements bring new export opportunities, new production demands, create new jobs, and boost our nations economy. In Missouri, there are 815,374 trade related jobs. And of the more than $14.5 billion of annual Missouri exports, 51 percent goes to existing free trade agreement partners, which is why it is essential we establish new trading relationships that will give Missouri goods and services greater access to the 95 percent of the worlds consumers who live outside of the United States. For example, Missouri farmers and ranchers export more than $4.1 billion in goods annually.
For many Missourians, particularly those who work each and every day in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, TPA is of the upmost importance and is a critical first step in ensuring the United States remains a leader in the global market place.
