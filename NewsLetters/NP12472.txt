Dear Friend,
This week, several of my colleagues joined me as I hosted a Special
Order to express our concerns over Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) overregulation that is raising the cost of electricity for
families, infringing on property rights of landowners, and hurting job
creation.
As I led this special order, I shared that I support common sense
regulations designed to protect us and the environment, but pointed out
that many of the EPA regulations have gone too far. County officials,
farmers, city administrators and moms and dads across Missouri who work
hard to pay heating bills are constantly coming to me with stories of
the burdens EPA regulations have placed on their families, businesses,
and communities. It's time for the EPA to begin working with us, with
local officials, and with state governments to bring common sense,
consensus-driven changes to their regulations instead of the typical,
heavy-handed Washington bureaucracy. Many of these regulations are
leading to slow economic recovery, stagnant job growth, and fewer
opportunities for the next generation of Americans.
These stifling regulations include unrealistic greenhouse gas emission
standards for new and existing power plants, proposed regulations for
wood burning stoves that could lead to a de facto ban on many currently
produced stoves, and an altered definition of 'navigable waters of the
U.S.' which would allow the EPA to expand its authority over rivers,
ponds, streams, and puddles.
This message is important in light of the fact the Obama Administration
continues to use executive orders, bypassing the elected
representatives of the people in Congress, to put into place these
increasingly burdensome regulations. From the new regulations on
coal-fired power plants to regulations for diesel tanks on farms,
everyday Americans are going to be forced to cope with higher energy
costs, erosion of their personal property rights, and additional
financial burdens from these unnecessary regulations. It is time to
stop this EPA overreach that is harming our country.
Additionally, the House passed The Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, H.R. 3590, a bill I'm proud to
cosponsor. The SHARE Act preserves our hunting and fishing heritage by
removing bureaucratic hurdles to hunting and fishing on public lands.
This bill reaffirms the right to bear arms on certain public lands and
limits the interference of the Environmental Protection Agency
regarding citizens and their right to take part in these outdoor
activities. Supporters of this bill include dozens of hunting,
shooting, fishing, and habitat conservation groups that promote
responsibility, sportsmanship, and respect for nature. I encourage the
Senate to take up this good legislation, pass it, and send it to the
President for his signature.
America learned some very important news this week regarding the high
cost of President Obama's health care law to American citizens. The
non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report claiming
the health care law will cost the nation the equivalent of 2.5 million
full-time jobs and contribute to a $1 trillion increase in projected
deficits.
The CBO also estimated the law will reduce labor force compensation by
1 percent from 2017 to 2024 - twice the reduction it previously
projected.
America's workers are hurting in this economy and the CBO confirms
Obamacare is only making things worse. We must replace Obamacare with a
new law providing Americans with access to affordable, quality health
care that does not eliminate jobs from our fragile economy. This report
is more proof that Obamacare is harmful to Americans and the American
economy - and has to go.
Finally, several of my Congressional colleagues from Missouri have
joined me in an effort to address the current propane shortage. We have
written to the Federal Highway Administration, requesting that it grant
a temporary, short-term waiver for current weight restrictions as they
apply to commercial motor vehicle travel on interstate highways.
Waiving the current restrictions is a common sense way of relieving the
pain being felt by Missourians and other Americans who are coping with
a shortage of propane gas to heat their homes and are experiencing
skyrocketing prices due to the shortage.
Our letter states that this winter's bitter cold weather and other
factors have contributed to increased propane use and a subsequent
shortage in Missouri's Fourth District and in many other parts of the
country. The shortage has forced propane marketers to travel greater
distances to secure fuel. A temporary weight restriction waiver would
allow carriers to transport more fuel to areas of the country where
problems are being experienced and help provide at least a partial
solution to this problem.
The letter states: "These challenging circumstances pose a significant
threat to life and property, and we believe that a temporary waiver for
weight restrictions is necessary to meet critical demand for heating
fuel."
There are some positive developments to share. The Department of
Transportation (DOT) has waived hours-of-service regulations for many
drivers who are assisting relief efforts. In addition, the Department
of Energy (DOE) has beefed-up its emergency operations center and is
working with suppliers to have additional supplies in place in the
event of future cold weather. Also, the Department Health and Human
Services (HHS) has released additional Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds to assist low-income families in
meeting their heating needs. But we must do more.
I, along with families all across Missouri, hope the Administration
will act quickly on this vital issue and waive weight restrictions and
better serve citizens of Missouri and the rest of the country.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
several
of
my
colleagues
joined
me
as
I
hosted
a
Special
Order
to
express
our
concerns
over
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
overregulation
that
is
raising
the
cost
of
electricity
for
families,
infringing
on
property
rights
of
landowners,
and
hurting
job
creation.
As
I
led
this
special
order,
I
shared
that
I
support
common
sense
regulations
designed
to
protect
us
and
the
environment,
but
pointed
out
that
many
of
the
EPA
regulations
have
gone
too
far.
County
officials,
farmers,
city
administrators
and
moms
and
dads
across
Missouri
who
work
hard
to
pay
heating
bills
are
constantly
coming
to
me
with
stories
of
the
burdens
EPA
regulations
have
placed
on
their
families,
businesses,
and
communities.
It&#8217;s
time
for
the
EPA
to
begin
working
with
us,
with
local
officials,
and
with
state
governments
to
bring
common
sense,
consensus-driven
changes
to
their
regulations
instead
of
the
typical,
heavy-handed
Washington
bureaucracy.
Many
of
these
regulations
are
leading
to
slow
economic
recovery,
stagnant
job
growth,
and
fewer
opportunities
for
the
next
generation
of
Americans.
These
stifling
regulations
include
unrealistic
greenhouse
gas
emission
standards
for
new
and
existing
power
plants,
proposed
regulations
for
wood
burning
stoves
that
could
lead
to
a
de

ban
on
many
currently
produced
stoves,
and
an
altered
definition
of
'navigable
waters
of
the
U.S.'
which
would
allow
the
EPA
to
expand
its
authority
over
rivers,
ponds,
streams,
and
puddles.
This
message
is
important
in
light
of
the
fact
the
Obama
Administration
continues
to
use
executive
orders,
bypassing
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
in
Congress,
to
put
into
place
these
increasingly
burdensome
regulations.
From
the
new
regulations
on
coal-fired
power
plants
to
regulations
for
diesel
tanks
on
farms,
everyday
Americans
are
going
to
be
forced
to
cope
with
higher
energy
costs,
erosion
of
their
personal
property
rights,
and
additional
financial
burdens
from
these
unnecessary
regulations.
It
is
time
to
stop
this
EPA
overreach
that
is
harming
our
country.
Additionally,
the
House
passed
The
Sportsmen's
Heritage
and
Recreational
Enhancement
(SHARE)
Act,
H.R.
3590,
a
bill
I&#8217;m
proud
to
cosponsor.
The
SHARE
Act
preserves
our
hunting
and
fishing
heritage
by
removing
bureaucratic
hurdles
to
hunting
and
fishing
on
public
lands.
This
bill
reaffirms
the
right
to
bear
arms
on
certain
public
lands
and
limits
the
interference
of
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
regarding
citizens
and
their
right
to
take
part
in
these
outdoor
activities.
Supporters
of
this
bill
include
dozens
of
hunting,
shooting,
fishing,
and
habitat
conservation
groups
that
promote
responsibility,
sportsmanship,
and
respect
for
nature.
I
encourage
the
Senate
to
take
up
this
good
legislation,
pass
it,
and
send
it
to
the
President
for
his
signature.
America
learned
some
very
important
news
this
week
regarding
the
high
cost
of
President
Obama's
health
care
law
to
American
citizens.
The
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
issued
a
report
claiming
the
health
care
law
will
cost
the
nation
the
equivalent
of
2.5
million
full-time
jobs
and
contribute
to
a
$1
trillion
increase
in
projected
deficits.
The
CBO
also
estimated
the
law
will
reduce
labor
force
compensation
by
1
percent
from
2017
to
2024
&#8211;
twice
the
reduction
it
previously
projected.
America&#8217;s
workers
are
hurting
in
this
economy
and
the
CBO
confirms
Obamacare
is
only
making
things
worse.
We
must
replace
Obamacare
with
a
new
law
providing
Americans
with
access
to
affordable,
quality
health
care
that
does
not
eliminate
jobs
from
our
fragile
economy.
This
report
is
more
proof
that
Obamacare
is
harmful
to
Americans
and
the
American
economy
&#8211;
and
has
to
go.
Finally,
several
of
my
Congressional
colleagues
from
Missouri
have
joined
me
in
an
effort
to
address
the
current
propane
shortage.
We
have
written
to
the
Federal
Highway
Administration,
requesting
that
it
grant
a
temporary,
short-term
waiver
for
current
weight
restrictions
as
they
apply
to
commercial
motor
vehicle
travel
on
interstate
highways.
Waiving
the
current
restrictions
is
a
common
sense
way
of
relieving
the
pain
being
felt
by
Missourians
and
other
Americans
who
are
coping
with
a
shortage
of
propane
gas
to
heat
their
homes
and
are
experiencing
skyrocketing
prices
due
to
the
shortage.
Our
letter
states
that
this
winter&#8217;s
bitter
cold
weather
and
other
factors
have
contributed
to
increased
propane
use
and
a
subsequent
shortage
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District
and
in
many
other
parts
of
the
country.
The
shortage
has
forced
propane
marketers
to
travel
greater
distances
to
secure
fuel.
A
temporary
weight
restriction
waiver
would
allow
carriers
to
transport
more
fuel
to
areas
of
the
country
where
problems
are
being
experienced
and
help
provide
at
least
a
partial
solution
to
this
problem.
The
letter
states:
&#8220;These
challenging
circumstances
pose
a
significant
threat
to
life
and
property,
and
we
believe
that
a
temporary
waiver
for
weight
restrictions
is
necessary
to
meet
critical
demand
for
heating
fuel.&#8221;
There
are
some
positive
developments
to
share.
The
Department
of
Transportation
(DOT)
has
waived
hours-of-service
regulations
for
many
drivers
who
are
assisting
relief
efforts.
In
addition,
the
Department
of
Energy
(DOE)
has
beefed-up
its
emergency
operations
center
and
is
working
with
suppliers
to
have
additional
supplies
in
place
in
the
event
of
future
cold
weather.
Also,
the
Department
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
has
released
additional
Low
Income
Home
Energy
Assistance
Program
(LIHEAP)
funds
to
assist
low-income
families
in
meeting
their
heating
needs.
But
we
must
do
more.
I,
along
with
families
all
across
Missouri,
hope
the
Administration
will
act
quickly
on
this
vital
issue
and
waive
weight
restrictions
and
better
serve
citizens
of
Missouri
and
the
rest
of
the
country.
Have
a
great
week.
