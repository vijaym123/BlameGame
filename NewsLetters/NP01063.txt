House Passes Congressional Balanced
Budget
The new Republican majority
in Congress made a commitment to the American people to provide
positive solutions to the nations challenges, to hold Washington
accountable and to restore economic vitality so folks all across our country can
realize their hopes and dreams for the future. Honoring that
commitment, the House last week passed a joint House-Senate balanced budget
plan
the first of its kind in over a decade. The Senate is expected to
take up and pass the same budget this
week.
Our proposal balances the nation's budget within 10
years without raising taxes and reduces spending by $5 trillion. The
credible solutions we are championing will build a brighter future for all
Americans
one where individuals and families will have more
opportunity, a more effective and efficient government, access to more
affordable health care choices, a healthier economy and a safer, stronger
and more secure nation.
Im
grateful for the work done by my colleagues in both the House and Senate,
and look forward to building upon this successful effort to tackle
other big challenges that the American people elected us to
solve.

Budget Tackles Out-of-Control Tuition
Costs
Last week, an article published on IJ
Review outlined how our budget proposal includes policies to curb the
rising cost of college for today's students and their
families:
Rather
than just talk around the problem, Republicans in Congress have
introduced a budget that would tackle the unsustainable growth in Pell
Grants and the attendant increases in college costs head-on. Among other
things, the Republican budget re-focuses the Pell Grants eligibility
formula so that it serves families with the highest financial hurdles to
attending college.
