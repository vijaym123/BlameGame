Dear Friend,
The following is a 'State of the District' column I penned for local
media outlets. I thought you might be interested to take a read, so I'm
sharing it with you here. Thank you, as always, for taking the time.
-
Joe
Most folks out there probably don't feel a particularly close
association with their Congressional District.
Your alma mater, yes.
The company you work for, most likely. Your home town, absolutely. But
I would be surprised if many of you count 'proud member of the 4th
Congressional District of Massachusetts' among the defining factors in
your personal or professional life.
For me, it's a little different. As someone whose job it is to
represent places as diverse as Milford, Norton, and Fall River - who
literally has '4th Congressional District of Massachusetts' stamped at
the end of his name - what has most defined my first year in office is
the surprisingly cohesive and collective story of the communities I
represent.
As we enter 2014, the story of this district is set in a state that has
undergone transformational economic shifts over the last half century,
reinventing itself around innovation industries like advanced
manufacturing, clean tech, life sciences and health care.
In many ways, this is a very good thing. These industries account for
almost 40 percent of employment in Massachusetts. New sectors are
springing up everywhere and bringing new jobs with them:
Big Data's
employment grew by 21 percent from 2007 to 2010 and robotics was hiring
at almost the same pace.
However, much of this recent growth has been concentrated in a few
select areas: Kendall Square, the Boston Seaport, the Route 128
Corridor. While those regions can and should and will be essential
parts of the Commonwealth's 21st century economy, sustainable growth
requires more than a nexus of growth - it requires a network of growth.
And that's where the 4th District comes in. From Mansfield to Medway to
Raynham and beyond - we are the first step in growing that network and
expanding the opportunities of an innovation economy outside the
Greater Boston Area and into every corner of the state.
This isn't news to those of you hard at work in our communities.
Whether it's the future life sciences center at Myles Standish in
Taunton, the new bio park in Fall River, the cluster of precision
manufacturers in Franklin or the proposed N2 Innovation Corridor
between Needham and Newton: the cities and towns in this district have
not shied away from the bold thinking, careful planning, and tough
decision-making that economic leadership requires.
At the federal level, I believe my job is to support your efforts any
way I can. Last year I was proud to introduce the Revitalize
Manufacturing and Innovation Act (RAMI) with a Republican colleague
from New York, Congressman Tom Reed.
With the growth of innovation industries, American manufacturing is
coming back. In 2011 alone, the sector brought in nearly $26 billion in
export profits to Massachusetts. Luckily for the 4th District,
manufacturing is in our blood, from the jewelry-makers in Attleboro,
silversmiths in Taunton, textile makers in Fall River and the straw hat
factories of Franklin.
But the challenge that faces us right now - the challenge I see every
day in our district - is how to adapt the infrastructure and expertise
that drove those historic industries to the brand-new sectors driving
growth today. RAMI helps by creating a network of regional
manufacturing institutes across the country that would bring
government, business and academia together under one roof to address a
specific, advanced manufacturing challenge of critical importance to
the local economy.
This bill is closely linked to another top priority of mine in
Washington: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
education and workforce training. Today there are 160,000 job openings
open in Massachusetts at a time when nearly 250,000 people are
unemployed because they don't have the skills these jobs require.
At the end of the day, our efforts to incubate new industries, attract
business and promote innovation in the 4th District, our Commonwealth
and our country won't matter if we don't have the human capital
required to support a modern economy.
Once again, the work here in our back yard is paving the way. Bristol
Community College has developed a clean energy curriculum crafted
directly from employment standards set by local industry. The
Innovation Lab at Newton North is teaching students how to build
everything from wind turbines to sustainable fabrics. Tri-County
Vocational School has partnered with data storage giant EMC in Franklin
to create pathways to employment directly after high school.
The efforts across the 4th District set a national standard for
quality, accessibility, and cooperation. What works in Wellesley won't
always work in Wrentham, but regional economies are as integrated as
they are interdependent, relying on a shared workforce, shared
resources, shared infrastructure and shared industry. So what happens
in Somerset matters in Brookline, even if the two places can feel a
world away.
Moving forward, it is these continued partnerships between federal,
state, and local stakeholders that will put this region at the
forefront of our state's innovation economy; to be not just passengers
of growth, but drivers.
The State of the 4th Congressional District is pioneering and proud.
May 2014 be our best year yet.
Sincerely,
Congressman Joe Kennedy

Dear
Friend,
The
following
is
a
&#8216;State
of
the
District&#8217;
column
I
penned
for
local
media
outlets.
I
thought
you
might
be
interested
to
take
a
read,
so
I&#8217;m
sharing
it
with
you
here.
Thank
you,
as
always,
for
taking
the
time.
&#8211;
Joe
Most
folks
out
there
probably
don&#8217;t
feel
a
particularly
close
association
with
their
Congressional
District.
Your
alma
mater,
yes.
The
company
you
work
for,
most
likely.
Your
home
town,
absolutely.
But
I
would
be
surprised
if
many
of
you
count
&#8216;proud
member
of
the
4th
Congressional
District
of
Massachusetts&#8217;
among
the
defining
factors
in
your
personal
or
professional
life.
For
me,
it&#8217;s
a
little
different.
As
someone
whose
job
it
is
to
represent
places
as
diverse
as
Milford,
Norton,
and
Fall
River
&#8211;
who
literally
has
&#8216;4th
Congressional
District
of
Massachusetts&#8217;
stamped
at
the
end
of
his
name
&#8211;
what
has
most
defined
my
first
year
in
office
is
the
surprisingly
cohesive
and
collective
story
of
the
communities
I
represent.
As
we
enter
2014,
the
story
of
this
district
is
set
in
a
state
that
has
undergone
transformational
economic
shifts
over
the
last
half
century,
reinventing
itself
around
innovation
industries
like
advanced
manufacturing,
clean
tech,
life
sciences
and
health
care.
In
many
ways,
this
is
a
very
good
thing.
These
industries
account
for
almost
40
percent
of
employment
in
Massachusetts.
New
sectors
are
springing
up
everywhere
and
bringing
new
jobs
with
them:
Big
Data&#8217;s
employment
grew
by
21
percent
from
2007
to
2010
and
robotics
was
hiring
at
almost
the
same
pace.
However,
much
of
this
recent
growth
has
been
concentrated
in
a
few
select
areas:
Kendall
Square,
the
Boston
Seaport,
the
Route
128
Corridor.
While
those
regions
can
and
should
and
will
be
essential
parts
of
the
Commonwealth&#8217;s
21st
century
economy,
sustainable
growth
requires
more
than
a
nexus
of
growth
&#8211;
it
requires
a
network
of
growth.
And
that&#8217;s
where
the
4th
District
comes
in.
From
Mansfield
to
Medway
to
Raynham
and
beyond
&#8211;
we
are
the
first
step
in
growing
that
network
and
expanding
the
opportunities
of
an
innovation
economy
outside
the
Greater
Boston
Area
and
into
every
corner
of
the
state.
This
isn&#8217;t
news
to
those
of
you
hard
at
work
in
our
communities.
Whether
it&#8217;s
the
future
life
sciences
center
at
Myles
Standish
in
Taunton,
the
new
bio
park
in
Fall
River,
the
cluster
of
precision
manufacturers
in
Franklin
or
the
proposed
N2
Innovation
Corridor
between
Needham
and
Newton:
the
cities
and
towns
in
this
district
have
not
shied
away
from
the
bold
thinking,
careful
planning,
and
tough
decision-making
that
economic
leadership
requires.
At
the
federal
level,
I
believe
my
job
is
to
support
your
efforts
any
way
I
can.
Last
year
I
was
proud
to
introduce
the
Revitalize
Manufacturing
and
Innovation
Act
(RAMI)
with
a
Republican
colleague
from
New
York,
Congressman
Tom
Reed.
With
the
growth
of
innovation
industries,
American
manufacturing
is
coming
back.
In
2011
alone,
the
sector
brought
in
nearly
$26
billion
in
export
profits
to
Massachusetts.
Luckily
for
the
4th
District,
manufacturing
is
in
our
blood,
from
the
jewelry-makers
in
Attleboro,
silversmiths
in
Taunton,
textile
makers
in
Fall
River
and
the
straw
hat
factories
of
Franklin.
But
the
challenge
that
faces
us
right
now
&#8211;
the
challenge
I
see
every
day
in
our
district
&#8211;
is
how
to
adapt
the
infrastructure
and
expertise
that
drove
those
historic
industries
to
the
brand-new
sectors
driving
growth
today.
RAMI
helps
by
creating
a
network
of
regional
manufacturing
institutes
across
the
country
that
would
bring
government,
business
and
academia
together
under
one
roof
to
address
a
specific,
advanced
manufacturing
challenge
of
critical
importance
to
the
local
economy.
This
bill
is
closely
linked
to
another
top
priority
of
mine
in
Washington:
Science,
Technology,
Engineering
and
Mathematics
(STEM)
education
and
workforce
training.
Today
there
are
160,000
job
openings
open
in
Massachusetts
at
a
time
when
nearly
250,000
people
are
unemployed
because
they
don&#8217;t
have
the
skills
these
jobs
require.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
our
efforts
to
incubate
new
industries,
attract
business
and
promote
innovation
in
the
4th
District,
our
Commonwealth
and
our
country
won&#8217;t
matter
if
we
don&#8217;t
have
the
human
capital
required
to
support
a
modern
economy.
Once
again,
the
work
here
in
our
back
yard
is
paving
the
way.
Bristol
Community
College
has
developed
a
clean
energy
curriculum
crafted
directly
from
employment
standards
set
by
local
industry.
The
Innovation
Lab
at
Newton
North
is
teaching
students
how
to
build
everything
from
wind
turbines
to
sustainable
fabrics.
Tri-County
Vocational
School
has
partnered
with
data
storage
giant
EMC
in
Franklin
to
create
pathways
to
employment
directly
after
high
school.
The
efforts
across
the
4th
District
set
a
national
standard
for
quality,
accessibility,
and
cooperation.
What
works
in
Wellesley
won&#8217;t
always
work
in
Wrentham,
but
regional
economies
are
as
integrated
as
they
are
interdependent,
relying
on
a
shared
workforce,
shared
resources,
shared
infrastructure
and
shared
industry.
So
what
happens
in
Somerset
matters
in
Brookline,
even
if
the
two
places
can
feel
a
world
away.
Moving
forward,
it
is
these
continued
partnerships
between
federal,
state,
and
local
stakeholders
that
will
put
this
region
at
the
forefront
of
our
state&#8217;s
innovation
economy;
to
be
not
just
passengers
of
growth,
but
drivers.
The
State
of
the
4th
Congressional
District
is
pioneering
and
proud.
May
2014
be
our
best
year
yet.
