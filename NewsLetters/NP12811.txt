David --
I&rsquo;m fired up.
I was just talking with my team about some of Mr. Schilling&rsquo;s recent comments about women.
Well, I couldn&rsquo;t be more motivated to get this campaign in full swing. I believe in Illinois and the great people that I'm honored to represent.
Instead of focusing on the divisive issues that Mr. Schilling is so fond of, I'm determined to remain focused on improving our communities.
But I need your help to make sure we can do that, David. We only have until midnight to meet our very first deadline of 2014. Will you help us start 2014 strong? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE:
Chip in $3 or whatever you can right now to help me keep fighting for Illinois&rsquo; 17th District &gt;&gt;
I'm ready to keeping fighting for the good people of Illinois in Congress. Are you ready to join me?
Let&rsquo;s make 2014 one to remember.
Thanks,
Cheri
