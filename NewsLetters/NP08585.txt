The 6th District
The Growing Crisis in
Iraq
Dear Friends:
Yesterday, President Obama stated he is prepared to take
targeted and precise military action -- if and when -- we determine the
situation on the ground requires it in
Iraq.
However, as the only Member of
Congress to have served in both wars in Iraq, I believe the President is
wrong to provide any additional military assistance for the
Shia-dominated government of Iraq until there is a process in place to bring about
a reconciliation between the government and the disaffected Sunni
Arab population.
Additional military assistance, at any
level prior to this, is fundamentally wrong and will only be seen as the
United States intervening in a sectarian civil
war.
After the U.S. completely pulled
out of Iraq, that nation immediately began to fracture.
The
Shia-dominated Iraqi government pushed out the Sunni Arabs, who have now
allied their militias with jihadist forces to push back against a
government that has lost all legitimacy to them.
Together, they have
thrown out the Iraqi Army from the Sunni Arab areas of the
country.
As an Iraq War
veteran, I'm very alarmed and deeply disappointed at what is happening
to that country after the gains that we made were paid for at such a
high cost.
I will demand that President Obama consult with
Congress as he develops his response to the
situation.
Sincerely,
Mike
Coffman
U.S. Representative

Rep wants VA
Research Data on Gulf War Illness
By Bryant Jordan
Military.com
Published June 13,
2014
A congressman from Colorado asked the
Department of Veteran Affairs Friday for data on the number of veterans
suffering from Gulf War Illness in light of the discovery that the VA had
hidden thousands of
veterans
on secret waiting
lists who needed care.
"Is the VA hiding vital information about a quarter of a million
Gulf War veterans who are waiting for care, just as the VA has been
hiding information on veteran patient wait times?"
Rep. Mike
Coffman , R-Colo., asked Acting Under Secretary for Veterans Health
Dr. Robert Jesse.
"Will you provide the committee with all of
the Gulf War data within 30 days?"
Jesse said he the VA is not hiding veterans suffering
from Gulf War illness. Gulf War veterans say the VA ignored for years
links between their service and chronic conditions that include
unremitting pain, memory loss, intestinal disorders and
exhaustion.
"We're not hiding data," Jesse
told Coffman during a hearing before the House Veterans Affairs
Committee. He followed up saying he could provide access to as much data the
VA owned that didn't interfere with privacy
rights.
"We're not looking for individual
names here," said Coffman, who served in the Gulf War as a Marine. "We're
looking for the conclusions of the research ... I want Gulf War
veterans to have access to this data, not just
me."
Jesse testified before the House committee
in response to revelations that officials and staff at VA hospital and
clinics across the country have manipulated patient appointment wait
times to make it appear they were meeting performance
goals.
The VA has found
more than 100,000 veterans waited
months for an appointment
rather than the two weeks expected or never got an appointment at
all.
Coffman's changed
the subject to focus on Gulf War Illness a week after the House passed
his legislation to make the VA's Gulf War Illness research more
transparent.
Coffman has
been critical of the VA's efforts to get to the bottom of Gulf War
illnesses, accusing the department of misdirecting research funding.
Coffman also slammed the VA for dismissing Gulf War illnesses as "something
that happens after every war," saying that attitude "dishonors the
service and sacrifices of those who fought in that
war."
James Binns, chairman of the
Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, said Coffman's
bill would restore to the committee its authority to review the
effectiveness of VA's research program the
research.
The VA leadership, including Jesse,
stripped that authority from the committee a year ago after the advisory
committee reported on some of the abuses to former VA Secretary Eric
Shinseki.
Binns delivered
his report in a different forum on March in
testimony before the House Veterans Affairs Committee
on
March 25.
Coffman's
bill would make the advisory committee an independent panel within the
VA, with the majority of its members appointed by the chairmen and
ranking members of the House and Senate veterans' affairs committees.
Now, they are appointed by the VA.
Last year Dr. Steven Coughlin, who resigned his job as a
senior epidemiologist in the VA's Office of Public Health, told
lawmakers that OPH buries or obfuscates data the VA does not want in the
public, including veterans' health problems from toxic exposures during
the
Gulf War
and more recent exposures to burn
pits in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Coughlin also told Congress that OPH had manipulated
information on veterans' health through the questions included in its
surveys.
"On the rare
occasions when embarrassing study results are released, data are manipulated
to make them unintelligible," Coughlin told the House
panel.
The information Coffman is
demanding stems from a 2010 study of 60,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war
veterans, of which between 20 to 30 percent also served in the 1991 Gulf
War.
Coughlin's testimony
revealed that the study
produced data on veterans' exposures to pesticides, oil well fires, and
pyridostigmine bromide pills that were taken by Gulf War vets as
pretreatment for possible exposure to nerve gas.
Not only was the data not released, he told
Congress, but VA never revealed that it had this information on Gulf War
veterans.
"Anything that supports the position that Gulf War illness is a
neurological condition is unlikely to ever be published," he
said.
Binns told Military.com that he
is hoping the revelations about appointment schedule manipulation
across the VA will put more pressure on the department to reveal what it
has on Gulf War Illness.
"It is worse than [the wait list issue]. It affects more
veterans," he said. "This is not just delaying care. This is denying care
entirely."
The VA has
found that more than 57,000 veterans had to wait about 90 days for an
appointment after requesting one, while another 60,000 over the past 10
years never saw a doctor after seeking an
appointment.
An estimated 250,000 Gulf War
veterans reportedly are suffering from the effects of exposure to toxins
during the conflict. The VA has to date awarded disability compensation
to just over 11,000 Gulf War vets for what it calls Gulf War-related
illnesses.
Another
20,000 have gotten VA disabilities for conditions it does not connect to
the 1991 conflict, Binns said.
"If lying about the wait list is bad, lying about science
and falsifying reports is much more serious," he said. "And the lying
goes up and down the organization, to the very
top."
U.S. Rep. Mike
Coffman will meet one-on-one with constituents at the Tallyn Reach
Library, 23911 East Arapahoe Road, Aurora, CO
80016 on Saturday, June
21st, from 10:30AM to 12:00 Noon.
Constituents are invited to come to the library

Mike
Coffman named VA Reform Panel
By: Mark

Published: June 19, 2014
U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman
was selected this week to serve
on the negotiating team that will hash out differences between the
House and Senate bills designed to reform the beleaguered U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs.
In that role, the Aurora Republican
a
military veteran
himself
will join with a small group of
other lawmakers to finalize legislation aimed at bringing more
accountability to VA officials while finding alternatives for veterans waiting
for medical care.
Its
also a major boost to Coffmans campaign credentials. The posting puts
Coffman in the national limelight at a time when hes defending his
seat against Democrat Andrew Romanoff, former speaker of the Colorado
House.
I am humbled to
be appointed as a conferee, and Ill be focused on fighting for
Colorado veterans every step of the way, Coffman said in a statement. We
must come together quickly in a bipartisan manner to iron out the
differences between our bills to address the VAs systemic problems, so our
nations veterans can finally get the care they
deserve.

Coffman requests investigation of VA's
treatment of a Denver veteran
By:

Published: June
16, 2014
U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman
has asked the inspector general of the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to investigate the agency's
treatment of a Denver veteran.
Coffman requested the investigation after a VA spokesman
characterized the veteran, who complained about his medical care, as mentally
ill.
"Flagrant violations
of law used to silence and intimidate critics are becoming
commonplace and accepted practice by the VA," Coffman wrote Monday in a letter
to Richard Griffin, acting inspector general for the VA. "Such actions
are appalling, and I believe it is time for you to take action to hold
the wrongdoers accountable for their reprehensible
conduct."
Last week, The Denver Post
reported
the story of a former Navy pilot, Michael Beckley , who alleged
a nurse practitioner at the VA hospital in Denver missed his prostate
cancer until it reached a potentially fatal
stage.
Daniel Warvi, a spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs,
disputed several facts of
Beckley's story
and confided in a phone call that Beckley is being
treated for what he called a severe mental illness. Warvi said he had
written clearance from Beckley to discuss his medical
history.
In an interview, Coffman called
Warvi's disclosure an indefensible and possibly criminal leak of
protected health information. "This is such a flagrant violation," he said,
blaming "a culture where no one is ever disciplined or fired for their
abusive behavior towards our veterans."
Coffman, R-Aurora, chairs the Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Veterans'
Affairs.
"The question that must
be addressed is who authorized this and how far did this go," he
said.
Warvi referred
questions to the agency's Washington office, which is checking what happened
in Denver and offered no immediate comment.
Beckley said he was called Saturday night by
the head of the mental health unit at the VA hospital, who "wanted to
know how I was doing," he said. "I told him I feel tremendously
violated."
Beckley said the
doctor asked what the VA could do for him. He responded that he wants a
retraction for disclosing and mischaracterizing his treatment, and to
"find solutions and not throw rocks at each
other."
He told The Post he is being treated for
a post-traumatic stress disorder and is receiving follow-up prostate
cancer care from a VA doctor.
