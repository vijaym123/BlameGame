David -- Tonight is our FIRST public fundraising deadline of the election.
The press, Mr. Boehner, our potential opponents&hellip; They all know I was just named the most vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois. They&rsquo;re looking for any sign of weakness.
That means falling short on our $1OO,OOO goal isn&rsquo;t an option. But right now, we've still got $3,6OO to go. David, I&rsquo;m counting on you to help close the gap. Rush $5 or more to our Democratic campaign -- before it&rsquo;s too late:
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250
Other
(A gift of any amount is appreciated.)
