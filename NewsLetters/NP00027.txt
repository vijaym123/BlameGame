Representative
Scott
Perry
June 21, 2015
This week the House again voted on a bill to allow Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). I continue to remain a proponent of free trade, and recognize the benefits of access to markets abroad for American companies and consumers; however, I again voted no because this bill fails to be a good deal for the American public. The hallmarks of our government should be openness and transparency; unfortunately, the bill we voted upon this week did little to alleviate my concerns about those issues and did little to give Congress and the American public enough of a say over international trade agreements. Im trying to find solutions and have co-sponsored legislation that requires any trade agreements be made public for 60 days before TPA is voted on. Thats the kind of transparency hard-working taxpayers rightly expect
and deserve.
The House of Representatives also voted this week by a large bipartisan majority to eliminate the medical device tax, one of the most costly surprises in the Affordable Care Act. The tax was placed upon devices such as pacemakers, dentures, surgical gloves, Lasik machines, MRI machines, defibrillators, heart valves, joint replacements, insulin pumps and many other life saving innovations that millions of Americans depend upon daily. Under the President's harmful health care law, medical innovation repeatedly has been stifled by unnecessary and costly taxes. This repeal will empower American entrepreneurs to pursue 21st Century health care solutions that will change lives around the world and create high-quality, high-paying jobs here at home, which in turn will help lower the cost of health care and speed up the rate of innovation. America has led the way in developing technology that revolutionizes the way we prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases
its time to finally end this tax that threatens Americas ability to remain a global leader in new and cutting edge treatments.
Sincerely,
Scott Perry
