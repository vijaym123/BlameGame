Dear David,
As we mark Veterans
Day today, please join me in thanking our nation's veterans, active
duty servicemen and women, and their families for their commitment to
keep America safe.
More than 500,000 veterans currently
reside in Missouri, and I'm always honored to meet these heroes and their
families as I travel the state or through the Honor Flight program in
Washington, D.C.
Although we set aside just
one day each year to formally recognize America's veterans, we owe
these brave men and women and their families a great debt of gratitude
each and every day for their selfless sacrifices.
Sincere
regards,
Washington D.C. Office
