Friend,
I just received an update from my finance team about our end of year deadline.
We&rsquo;re close to our 2013 goal, but we&rsquo;re not there yet.
With just over 24 hours to go, we need to find an additional $3,247 by midnight on December 31 st
to make sure we have what we need for our campaign to grow in January.
Please click here to chip in $5 or more right now towards our 2013 goal.
We&rsquo;re in the final stretch and this deadline is critical to keep our momentum going.
Thank you for all you&rsquo;ve done.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&rsquo;s 7 th
District

Hi Congressman,
A quick update on our year end benchmarks&mdash; our goal is in sight, but we need a few more people to pitch in before our big deadline.
Since Friday, we&rsquo;ve raised $1,753 towards our $5,000 goal.
That leaves an additional $3,247 that we must raise online before midnight tomorrow.
It&rsquo;ll be close, but I know our team can do it.
This deadline is the most important so far, and we need to make sure we close 2013 on solid ground.
In case you need it, here&rsquo;s the best link for folks to contribute:

I&rsquo;ll keep you updated as we close the gap.
Thanks!
Elena
