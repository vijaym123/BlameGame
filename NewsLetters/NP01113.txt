National Association of Manufactures Recognizes Forbes
for Pro-Jobs Record
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) was awarded the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence, which recognizes Members of Congress whose voting records support creating jobs, strengthening manufacturing, and lighting up the economy. The event was hosted by Smithfield Foods on April 20, 2015.
Our manufacturing base is a powerful foundation in our national economy, said Congressman Forbes. As manufacturing grows, it spurs job creation and innovation in other industries through a multiplier effect. In Virginias Fourth District alone, our manufacturing industry employs thousands of people in steady, good paying jobs. One of my priorities in Congress is ensuring this important industry isnt hamstrung by overly heavy burdens placed on it by the federal government, as well as positioning the Fourth District to continue to grow as a leader in the manufacturing space -- in turn, fueling our national economy and setting ourselves up for global competitiveness.
Congressman Forbes was honored with this award based on his voting record on important manufacturing issues, ranging from energy to federal regulations. His rating from NAM is an outstanding 100 percent on key manufacturing votes in the 113th Congress.
The Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence is given to members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who have demonstrated an excellent understanding of manufacturings key role in our economy and society through their voting records. The voting records were based on NAMs positions on Key Manufacturing Votes. The National Association of Manufacturers is the United States largest industrial trade association, as well as the leading manufacturers association, and represents manufacturers of all sizes in all 50 states and every industrial sector.
