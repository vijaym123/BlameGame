David -- we&rsquo;re running out of time, so I&rsquo;ll get right to it.
After tonight, we&rsquo;ll have a permanent record of all the Founding Members of our Middle Class Action Fund.
That means we&rsquo;ll know exactly who stepped up to fight for a higher minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, and a fair shot for Illinois&rsquo; families. We have until 11:59PM to make this program a success.
So we need all hands on deck, David.
According to our records it looks like you haven&rsquo;t registered as a Founding Member. Don&rsquo;t worry, David! You can become a Founding Member by chipping in $5 or more.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks so much,
Cheri
