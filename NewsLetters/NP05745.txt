What You Need to Know About
Ebola
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
this week confirmed the first case of Ebola in the United States.
While we are currently not at risk in our district or state, there is
much concern surrounding this deadly disease.
The CDC is working
with state health officials across the country to enact uniform Ebola
procedures and airline companies, along with the Transportation
Security Agency (TSA), are monitoring citizens traveling to and from Africa
countries to ensure that infected persons do not enter the United
States.
Since there are many questions surrounding this
Ebola, I have included some questions and answers, provided by the CDC and
World Health Organization, on the disease below.
Please read
these and share them with your friends and
family.
Questions and Answers on
Ebola
What is Ebola?
Ebola virus is the cause of a viral hemorrhagic fever disease.
Symptoms include: fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness,
diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, lack of appetite, and abnormal bleeding.
Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to Ebola
virus though 8-10 days is most common.
How is
Ebola transmitted?
Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or bodily
fluids of an infected symptomatic person or though exposure to objects
(such as needles) that have been contaminated with infected
secretions.
Who is most at risk?
During an outbreak, those at higher risk
of infection are: health workers, family members or others in close
contact with infected people, and mourners who have direct contact with
the bodies of the deceased as part of burial ceremonies. Exposure to
the virus can be controlled through the use of protective measures in
clinics and hospitals, at community gatherings, or at home.
More research is needed to understand if
some groups, such as immuno-compromised people or those with other
underlying health conditions, are more susceptible than others to
contracting the virus.
Can Ebola be transmitted
through the air?
No.
Ebola is not a respiratory disease like the flu, so it is not
transmitted through the air.
Can I get Ebola from
contaminated food or water?
No. Ebola is not a food-borne illness. It is not a water-borne
illness.
Can I get Ebola from a person
who is infected but doesnt have any symptoms?
No. Individuals who are not symptomatic
are not contagious. In order for the virus to be transmitted, an
individual would have to have direct contact with an individual who is
experiencing
symptoms.
Upcoming Economic Development
Symposium
I am looking forward to our
Economic Development Symposium this Friday, October 10.
As
you know, jobs and the economy are my top priority in Congress, and
economic development is what brings jobs and new business to our
community.
At each level of government, we must ensure that we
are doing all we can to compete and attract new businesses to our
area.
At the symposium, representatives from Ruiz Food,
Beneteau, Harbor Freight Tools, and Domtar will share with us why they
chose our district to expand their business , what economic
factors make doing business here easy, and the regulatory areas that need
improvement.
This should be a great event and I look recapping
the event in our next e-newsletter.
For more information or to
attend the symposium, please contact Rodney Berry in our Pee Dee
District Office at
843-679-9781.
