Congressman Lamborn Opposes Debt Ceiling
Increase
On Tuesday,
February 11th, Congressman Lamborn voted against the increase in the
Debt Ceiling.
"Any
increase in our national debt must be tied to spending reforms and deficit
reductions. We cannot keep marching down the same path that adds to the
debt burden of our children and grandchildren."
