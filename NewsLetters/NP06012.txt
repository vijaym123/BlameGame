Last Day: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
First, Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now, a group of Democratic supporters has agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS.
Hillary Clinton wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you yesterday if it wasn&rsquo;t critically important:
FIRST:
One Republican billionaire gave $1O,OOO,OOO to Karl Rove&rsquo;s Obama-bashing secret money group.
THEN:
This morning, Boehner launched his biggest ad blitz of the election
We won&rsquo;t mince words: Boehner&rsquo;s $4,OOO,OOO smear campaign could cost us the whole election.
David, control of Congress is at stake. We can&rsquo;t do this on our own. According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in to Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s call-to-action.
Please chip in before tonight&rsquo;s triple-match deadline -- when your donation can make the biggest impact.
