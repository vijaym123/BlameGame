Dear Friend,
This week, the U.S. House took important steps to secure America's
energy future, approving three common sense bills promoting widely
shared energy policy goals.
The Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Act - H.R. 1965 - combines several
bills aimed at expanding offshore energy production as well as
streamlining government roadblocks and bureaucratic red tape that block
and delay American energy production and job creation. The bill would
reform the leasing process for oil and natural gas projects on federal
lands to eliminate unnecessary delays. Additionally, it would ensure
funds are available for efficient wind and solar permitting.
The Protecting States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act -
H.R. 2728 - will help promote American jobs and energy creation by
limiting regulations from the Administration on hydraulic fracturing, a
process used to extract oil and natural gas. The legislation prohibits
the Interior Department from enforcing hydraulic fracturing regulations
in any state that already has regulations and recognizes states'
authority to regulate this type of activity. How important is this form
of energy extraction? According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S.
holds more than half of the world's oil shale resources - six times
Saudi Arabia's proven resources and enough to provide the United States
with energy for the next 200 years. A 2012 report from the economic
consulting firm HIS Global Insight found unconventional shale oil and
gas alone support more than 1.7 million jobs, which is expected to
increase to 3 million jobs as soon as 2020. The fact is that increased
energy production will result in lower energy prices and cost savings
through less expensive goods and services.
The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act - H.R. 1900 - is a
bipartisan effort to expedite the federal review process for natural
gas pipeline permit applications. It amends the Natural Gas Act to
require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve or
deny a permit application for a natural gas pipeline project within 12
months of the filing of that application. Furthermore, it will require
the agency responsible for issuing a federal license or permit to take
action within 90 days of FERC issuing its final environmental document
regarding a project. Currently, energy producers are waiting an average
of 307 days for permits to drill on approved federal lands. Compare
this to the 12-15 days to get permits for drilling on approved state
lands. There is no reason for these lengthy delays.
The House took action this week to make your federal government more
accountable by addressing those disturbing videos we have seen of IRS
employees partying in lavish surroundings on the taxpayers' dime. The
Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act of 2013 - H.R. 2061 -
establishes government-wide data standards for the Treasury Department
regarding federal expenditures. Specifically, the legislation sets
limits and transparency for conference and travel spending by federal
employees. This bill prohibits federal agencies from paying for the
travel expenses for more than 50 employees of that agency to attend any
international conference unless the attendance is in the national
interest. Lastly, at the beginning of each quarter, federal agencies
will be required to post a report on each conference that costs more
than $10,000 for which the agency paid travel expenses during the
preceding three months - with agencies prohibited from spending more
than $500,000 to support any single conference.
In an area of great concern, you might have heard reports that the
Obama Administration is close to an agreement to suspend sanctions
against Iran in exchange for a six-month freeze of Iranian enrichment
activities. The simple truth is that it was implementation of economic
sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first
place. Relieving sanctions without a guarantee that Iran will end its
nuclear program is foolish. The U.S. must not rush into any deal
without first guaranteeing the security of America and its allies in
the region - particularly Israel. All indications are that Iran has no
intention of halting its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The United States
must maintain robust sanctions until Iran is ready to change course.
Our office continues to hear stories from citizens of Missouri's Fourth
District regarding the negative impact of President Obama's health care
law. I shared some of their stories in a video this week that urges the
Senate to take up and pass House-approved legislation that would allow
citizens across the country to keep their health plans. A link to that
video is included in this week's newsletter.
On another matter, I was honored this week to have been presented the
2013 ALOT Agricultural Leader of the Year award. ALOT - Agricultural
Leadership of Tomorrow - is a two-year leadership program, attracting
Missouri adults from across the state, representing rural and urban
areas, full-time farmers and agribusinesses, media, and financial
representatives.
It means a great deal to me to be honored by this group as ALOT's
mission is to provide leadership experiences that will make a positive
difference to the future of agriculture and rural communities in
Missouri and beyond. As a lifelong farmer who now serves on the House
Agriculture Committee, I am committed to promoting agriculture in
Missouri and throughout our country. I look forward to updating you on
Congress' biggest agricultural responsibility, passing a Farm Bill, and
sharing with you that negotiators from the House and Senate worked this
week to reach agreement on this critical legislation to maintain
America's safe, affordable, and plentiful food supply.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
U.S.
House
took
important
steps
to
secure
America&#8217;s
energy
future,
approving
three
common
sense
bills
promoting
widely
shared
energy
policy
goals.
The
Federal
Lands
Jobs
and
Energy
Act
-
H.R.
1965
-
combines
several
bills
aimed
at
expanding
offshore
energy
production
as
well
as
streamlining
government
roadblocks
and
bureaucratic
red
tape
that
block
and
delay
American
energy
production
and
job
creation.
The
bill
would
reform
the
leasing
process
for
oil
and
natural
gas
projects
on
federal
lands
to
eliminate
unnecessary
delays.
Additionally,
it
would
ensure
funds
are
available
for
efficient
wind
and
solar
permitting.
The
Protecting
States&#8217;
Rights
to
Promote
American
Energy
Security
Act
&#8211;
H.R.
2728
&#8211;
will
help
promote
American
jobs
and
energy
creation
by
limiting
regulations
from
the
Administration
on
hydraulic
fracturing,
a
process
used
to
extract
oil
and
natural
gas.
The
legislation
prohibits
the
Interior
Department
from
enforcing
hydraulic
fracturing
regulations
in
any
state
that
already
has
regulations
and
recognizes
states&#8217;
authority
to
regulate
this
type
of
activity.
How
important
is
this
form
of
energy
extraction?
According
to
the
U.S.
Geological
Survey,
the
U.S.
holds
more
than
half
of
the
world&#8217;s
oil
shale
resources
&#8211;
six
times
Saudi
Arabia&#8217;s
proven
resources
and
enough
to
provide
the
United
States
with
energy
for
the
next
200
years.
A
2012
report
from
the
economic
consulting
firm
HIS
Global
Insight
found
unconventional
shale
oil
and
gas
alone
support
more
than
1.7
million
jobs,
which
is
expected
to
increase
to
3
million
jobs
as
soon
as
2020.
The
fact
is
that
increased
energy
production
will
result
in
lower
energy
prices
and
cost
savings
through
less
expensive
goods
and
services.
The
Natural
Gas
Pipeline
Permitting
Reform
Act
&#8211;
H.R.
1900
&#8211;
is
a
bipartisan
effort
to
expedite
the
federal
review
process
for
natural
gas
pipeline
permit
applications.
It
amends
the
Natural
Gas
Act
to
require
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
(FERC)
to
approve
or
deny
a
permit
application
for
a
natural
gas
pipeline
project
within
12
months
of
the
filing
of
that
application.
Furthermore,
it
will
require
the
agency
responsible
for
issuing
a
federal
license
or
permit
to
take
action
within
90
days
of
FERC
issuing
its
final
environmental
document
regarding
a
project.
Currently,
energy
producers
are
waiting
an
average
of
307
days
for
permits
to
drill
on
approved
federal
lands.
Compare
this
to
the
12-15
days
to
get
permits
for
drilling
on
approved
state
lands.
There
is
no
reason
for
these
lengthy
delays.
The
House
took
action
this
week
to
make
your
federal
government
more
accountable
by
addressing
those
disturbing
videos
we
have
seen
of
IRS
employees
partying
in
lavish
surroundings
on
the
taxpayers&#8217;
dime.
The
Digital
Accountability
and
Transparency
(DATA)
Act
of
2013
&#8211;
H.R.
2061
&#8211;
establishes
government-wide
data
standards
for
the
Treasury
Department
regarding
federal
expenditures.
Specifically,
the
legislation
sets
limits
and
transparency
for
conference
and
travel
spending
by
federal
employees.
This
bill
prohibits
federal
agencies
from
paying
for
the
travel
expenses
for
more
than
50
employees
of
that
agency
to
attend
any
international
conference
unless
the
attendance
is
in
the
national
interest.
Lastly,
at
the
beginning
of
each
quarter,
federal
agencies
will
be
required
to
post
a
report
on
each
conference
that
costs
more
than
$10,000
for
which
the
agency
paid
travel
expenses
during
the
preceding
three
months
&#8211;
with
agencies
prohibited
from
spending
more
than
$500,000
to
support
any
single
conference.
In
an
area
of
great
concern,
you
might
have
heard
reports
that
the
Obama
Administration
is
close
to
an
agreement
to
suspend
sanctions
against
Iran
in
exchange
for
a
six-month
freeze
of
Iranian
enrichment
activities.
The
simple
truth
is
that
it
was
implementation
of
economic
sanctions
that
brought
Iran
to
the
negotiating
table
in
the
first
place.
Relieving
sanctions
without
a
guarantee
that
Iran
will
end
its
nuclear
program
is
foolish.
The
U.S.
must
not
rush
into
any
deal
without
first
guaranteeing
the
security
of
America
and
its
allies
in
the
region
&#8211;
particularly
Israel.
All
indications
are
that
Iran
has
no
intention
of
halting
its
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons.
The
United
States
must
maintain
robust
sanctions
until
Iran
is
ready
to
change
course.
Our
office
continues
to
hear
stories
from
citizens
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District
regarding
the
negative
impact
of
President
Obama&#8217;s
health
care
law.
I
shared
some
of
their
stories
in
a
video
this
week
that
urges
the
Senate
to
take
up
and
pass
House-approved
legislation
that
would
allow
citizens
across
the
country
to
keep
their
health
plans.
A
link
to
that
video
is
included
in
this
week&#8217;s
newsletter.
On
another
matter,
I
was
honored
this
week
to
have
been
presented
the
2013
ALOT
Agricultural
Leader
of
the
Year
award.
ALOT
&#8211;
Agricultural
Leadership
of
Tomorrow
-
is
a
two-year

across
the
state,
representing
rural
and
urban
areas,
full-time

and
agribusinesses,
media,
and
financial
representatives.
It
means
a
great
deal
to
me
to
be
honored
by
this
group
as
ALOT&#8217;s
mission
is
to
provide
leadership
experiences
that
will
make
a
positive
difference
to
the
future
of
agriculture
and
rural
communities
in
Missouri
and
beyond.
As

farmer
who
now
serves
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee,
I
am

our
country.
I
look
forward
to
updating
you
on
Congress&#8217;
biggest
agricultural
responsibility,
passing
a
Farm
Bill,
and
sharing
with
you
that
negotiators
from
the
House
and
Senate
worked
this
week
to
reach
agreement
on
this
critical
legislation
to
maintain
America&#8217;s
safe,
affordable,
and
plentiful
food
supply.
Have
a
great
week.
