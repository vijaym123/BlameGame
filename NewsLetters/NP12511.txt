Celebrating NH Olympians Competing in Sochi
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a great weekend. I spent last week in Washington,
working to make the voice of Granite Staters heard and pushing for
comprehensive immigration reform.
With Tiger Shaw, future CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association
NH Athletes on the World Stage
On Monday, to mark the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics, I joined with
other members of the Congressional Ski and Snowboard Caucus to host a
Send-off to Sochi event to celebrate the U.S. ski and snowboard teams
as they prepare for competition in Sochi, Russia. At this bipartisan
send-off, my fellow Caucus Co-Chair Cynthia Lummis (WY) and I welcomed
former Olympians and members of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association.
I could not be more proud and more excited for the all of the talented
Olympic skiers and snowboarders from around New Hampshire and all
across our country. These amazing athletes have worked so hard for so
long. Now they are ready to make their country proud as they go for the
gold in Sochi. Good luck to all of the Granite State skiers and to the
entire American Olympic delegation. (You can learn more about New
Hampshire's Olympians here

At the press conference
Amplifying the Voice of Granite Staters
On Wednesday, I joined other Members of Congress for a press conference
to introduce comprehensive legislation to reform our campaign finance
system. Introduced by Congressman John Sarbanes, the Government by the
People Act would combat the influence of special interests in politics
and amplify the voices of everyday Americans. New Hampshire has a
strong tradition of civic engagement, but communities and individuals
are competing on an uneven playing field against entrenched,
well-funded special interests. This important bill would change that.
This legislation has over 100 original cosponsors and has brought
together a wide coalition of national organizations. I am so excited to
be part of the effort to reform the campaign finance system and return
our democracy to the people.
Speaking on comprehensive immigration reform
Pushing for Comprehensive Immigration Reform
On Wednesday, I spoke in support of comprehensive immigration reform on
the House floor. Our borders remain vulnerable, employers game the
system by hiring undocumented workers, and millions of individuals are
living in the shadows. This status quo fails to meet the needs of
businesses, is unfair for workers, and is holding back economic growth
and opportunity in our country. Congress must prioritize the
consideration of bipartisan legislation to comprehensively reform and
modernize our immigration system. It has been over 200 days since the
Senate passed similar reform legislation, and it is long past time for
the House of Representatives to do the same. (Please watch my speech

Working to Reduce Carbon Pollution
Continuing my efforts to combat climate change, last week I joined
Congresswoman Niki Tsongas (MA-03) to lead a group of northeast
lawmakers calling on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to look
to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) as a model for their
efforts to curb carbon pollution across the country. RGGI is a
cooperative effort among New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, and Maryland to reduce
carbon pollution from power plants, a key driver of climate change.
Since the program took effect in 2005, the RGGI states have seen a 40
percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and they are on track to
reduce emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2020.
In a recent letter sent to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, my
colleagues and I cited RGGI as a proven model for cutting carbon
pollution and driving economic development, while protecting the
public's health and our environment. We urged the EPA to look toward
the program as the agency works to set federal standards to cut carbon
pollution from the nation's existing power plants. (You can learn more
about this effort here
.)
Helping a Granite Stater Navigate Federal Regulations
Last July, my office was contacted by Carl Anderson, a truck driver
from Pittsfield, regarding a $10,000 violation claim made by the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) that he believed he
did not rightfully owe. A commercial truck driver for 43 years and a
one-truck owner operator for 11 years, Carl first received his own
Motor Carrier Operating Authority in 2004 after fulfilling all
requirements of FMCSA. In 2012 and 2013 there had been some minor
licensing changes to his operating authority that he had every reason
to believe had been accurately completed.
Last June, during a standard truck inspection in Connecticut, he was
told that his Operating Authority was 'inactive' due to a missing paper
in his file. The fine for operating without authority is 'not less than
$10,000,' and Carl was billed accordingly. A fine of this size, or even
the legal cost of defending himself in federal court, would have dealt
him a staggering financial blow. Faced with nowhere to turn and no way
to convince FMCSA that the error had been unintentional, he contacted
my office and asked if there was anything I could do. Through hard work
and determination we were able to resolve the issue with FMCSA, the
case was 'closed without enforcement,' and Carl is now free of the life
altering burden he had been facing. If my office may ever be of
assistance with a problem you are facing, please contact my staff at
603-226-1002 so we may help you resolve your problem or get you the
information you need.
Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Last
July,
my
office
was
contacted
by
Carl
Anderson,
a
truck
driver
from
Pittsfield,
regarding
a
$10,000
violation
claim
made
by
the
Federal
Motor
Carrier
Safety
Administration
(FMCSA)
that
he
believed
he
did
not
rightfully
owe. A
commercial
truck
driver
for
43
years
and
a
one-truck
owner
operator
for
11
years,
Carl
first
received
his
own
Motor
Carrier
Operating
Authority
in
2004
after
fulfilling
all
requirements
of
FMCSA. In
2012
and
2013
there
had
been
some
minor
licensing
changes
to
his
operating
authority
that
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
had
been
accurately
completed.
Last
June,
during
a
standard
truck
inspection
in
Connecticut,
he
was
told
that
his
Operating
Authority
was
'inactive'
due
to
a
missing
paper
in
his
file. The
fine
for
operating
without
authority
is
'not
less
than
$10,000,'
and
Carl
was
billed
accordingly. A
fine
of
this
size,
or
even
the
legal
cost
of
defending
himself
in
federal
court,
would
have
dealt
him
a
staggering
financial
blow. Faced
with
nowhere
to
turn
and
no
way
to
convince
FMCSA
that
the
error
had
been
unintentional,
he
contacted
my
office
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
I
could
do. Through
hard
work
and
determination
we
were
able
to
resolve
the
issue
with
FMCSA,
the
case
was
'closed
without
enforcement,'
and
Carl
is
now
free
of
the
life
altering
burden
he
had
been
facing. If

Have
a
fantastic

and
