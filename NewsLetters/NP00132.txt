A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN
STENY H. HOYER
As the investigation
continues into the cyber attack against the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM), I want to ensure that current and former federal employees in the
Fifth District who may have been impacted have the necessary
information and resources they need. OPM is continuing to notify individuals
whose personal information may have been compromised through
Friday, June 19th via an email from
opmcio@csid.com
or a letter through the mail. OPM has also created a
"frequently asked questions" page to answer some of the questions you may
have, including:
What happened?
What
personal information was compromised?
What is OPM doing
to prevent this kind of loss from happening again?
Who
is responsible for this incident?
I haven't gotten an
email or a letter yet. Does this mean I am not
affected?
For a complete list of "frequently asked questions," please click

As you know, I am proud to
represent thousands of federal employees who provide essential services to
Americans and I believe their personal information should be kept
safe and secure. My office is ready and prepared to help you navigate
this ongoing process.
As always, thank you for allowing
me to share this update with you, and please continue to share your
concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting
with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter , or
YouTube .
With warmest regards, I am
Sincerely
yours,
Steny H. Hoyer
