David,
Our campaign just went on the air with our first television ad, and I think you'll agree that this isn&rsquo;t your typical ad. For starters, I come right out and say it: I&rsquo;m a Democrat.
Washington pundits will say I shouldn't advertise that I&rsquo;m a Democrat -- that we&rsquo;re locked in a dead heat and shouldn't take the risk. But I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those candidates who hides their party. Take a moment to watch -- then tell me what you think.
Let me be clear, I don't think either party has a lock on all the good ideas, and I'll work with anyone who has an open mind and the willingness to work together to move our nation forward.
But recently Republicans only seem to focus on re-fighting old battles over birth control and telling folks who they can marry. Too often they seem to simply be the "Party of No!" It&rsquo;s time for the Republican obstructionism to come to an end.
In contrast, Democrats believe &ldquo;We the people&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;We the few.&rdquo; We believe in a vibrant middle class, a secure retirement for our seniors, and a bright future for the next generation. We believe that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can make it in America.
I am proud to be a Democrat and look forward to fighting for our values and priorities in Congress.
David, if you share that vision, I want to hear from you. Tell me what being a Democrat means to you: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/First-Ad
And as we head into the final weeks of this election, remember that Illinois families are counting on our success.
Thanks for standing with me,
Brad
