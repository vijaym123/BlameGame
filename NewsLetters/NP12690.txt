Dear Friend,
Last
Tuesday, President Obama delivered his fifth State of the Union Address.
Unfortunately, the President refuses to work on common-sense areas of
cooperation with House Republicans. He pays lip service to American
energy development and removing bureaucratic red tape, yet he refuses to
even consider H.R. 1965, my legislation that has passed the House to
speed up the permitting process to give certainty and stability to the
energy market. He wouldn't even offer a word of support to the Keystone
pipeline, a project supported by overwhelming bipartisan majorities
that would lead to thousands of American jobs.
Another disturbing facet of the Address
was the President's insistence that he would regularly attempt to use
his pen and his phone to take actions bypassing Congress. Well, I
have a Constitution and an Oath and I will stand up to any attempts by
this President to take actions unconstitutionally bypassing
Congress.
Bill Clinton figured
out how to work with Congress, so for the President to refuse to work
with Congress is an admission of failure on his
part.
It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's Happening in Washington
DC?
I had the opportunity to speak with
multiple media outlets sharing my reaction to President Obama's State of
the Union Address.

On Tuesday, January 28th, I cosponsored and
voted for H.R. 7 the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The bill
passed the House with bipartisan vote of 227 to 188. I
remain steadfast in my commitment to protect the sanctity of human life, and ensuring
that federal funds will never be used to destroy innocent life is a
step in the right direction.
On
Wednesday, January 29th, I voted against the 2014 Farm Bill
Conference Report. It passed by a vote of 251 to 166. This 949-page bill was
yet another bloated proposal that House and Senate leaders tried rushing
through Congress without giving members and the public enough time to
read and understand the bill. This legislation was also a missed
opportunity to make meaningful reforms to both agriculture and nutritional
programs because it rolled back many of the reforms included in the
House passed version. While the legislation makes a few positive
reforms to food stamps, it still encompasses almost 80 percent of spending
within the legislation and does not contain work requirements or drug
testing, which are fundamental to welfare reform and does nothing to
correct the ballooning cost of the food stamp program. However I am
pleased that funding for Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) was included in
this bill. I worked hard and met personally with House leadership to
ensure that PILT funding would be restored to our rural counties who
have a critical need for this
funding.
Also on Wednesday,
January 29th, I participated in an important hearing in the House Armed
Services Committee dealing with the issue of religious freedom in the
military. I remain committed to protecting our service men and women
from religious persecution in all
forms.

It was a pleasure to host a meeting last week with Colorado residents
representing the National Federation of the Blind. They presented me
with multiple pieces of legislation that I will carefully consider in
the weeks and months ahead. Their dedication and passion always makes
for an uplifting day during their annual visit to
Washington.
Last week, I also had the honor of meeting with General Charles
Jacoby, the NORAD-NORTHCOM Commander. In the Rayburn Room right off of
the House Floor, we discussed multiple defense issues involving the
Fifth Congressional District including the new Combat Aviation and Stryker
Brigades at Fort Carson.
Recently, an article ran in the Colorado Springs Gazette
discussing the efforts made, including by my own staff, to help return a
Colorado Springs resident home after years of homelessness in Mexico.

What Say
You?
One of the most important things I can do is listen to my
constituents. My staff and I get thousands of phone calls, emails, letters,
and social media postings every week. Here is a sampling of what you
are saying.
On
my
Facebook
this week constituents shared their thoughts on the
State of the Union Address:

No disrespect intended towards the office, but family
had outside obligations-family first. I don't need to listen to someone
I can't trust to be telling the truth, someone who is so out of touch
with where the common man is right
now.

Who wants to hear lies, lies, and more lies?
Gail

- I have to say this has been the worst two
terms EVER. It is so depressing
Dallas Brooks
- Congressman, the
President has said he will work with the Congress...unless you disagree with
him, then he'll act unilaterally :-(
