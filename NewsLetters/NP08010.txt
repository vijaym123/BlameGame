The Fourth of July is a unique American holiday that brings us together as Americans. As you partake in the fun activities and celebrations, please take a moment to reflect on our country's independence, the cost of maintaining it, and what it means to you. For me, I value freedom, respect, a strong military, a leader, a shining city, hope, opportunity, equality, respect, safe, principled, unstoppable, and grandjust to name a few. To commemorate this special day, I recently had the opportunity to recite a portion of the Declaration of Independence on the House floor; truly an experience I will never forget.

But what does being an American really mean? To me it means my children are safe and free to be their best. It means I can pursue my dreams; it means I am respected because of what others before me sacrificed; it means that small things are just as important as monumental things and that all thoughts, opinions, and actions have equal weight - no matter what. It means I'm just as good or at least no worse than the person next to me - forever. It means I don't have to fear for any reason. What does it mean to be an American to me? Everything.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
