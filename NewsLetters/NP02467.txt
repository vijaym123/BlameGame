Focusing On Veterans'
Healthcare
3/2/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported two pieces of legislation
designed to help our brave veterans. H.R. 294, the Long-Term Care
Veterans Choice Act will allow eligible veterans to receive long term,
more family-style medical care in a medical foster home setting. H.R.
280 is a bill
authorizing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to
recoup bonuses and awards paid to employees of the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
