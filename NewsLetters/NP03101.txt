Dear Friends,
When
I was elected to Congress in 2010, I promised to put the values of
ordinary Idahoans ahead of special interests.
On Monday, I
along with eight House colleagues formed the House Freedom Caucus. Our
aim is to advance an agenda of a limited, constitutional government and
give voice to those who feel Washington doesnt represent
them.
We will advocate for the rule of law and policies that promote
the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans.
We
expect our group to grow, comprising a block of votes large enough to help
shift the House to a more conservative footing. Im confident we can
make a difference, filling a void for constituents back
home.
My founding colleagues in the Freedom Caucus are Scott Garrett of
New Jersey, Jim Jordan of Ohio, John Fleming of Louisiana, Matt Salmon
of Arizona, Justin Amash of Michigan, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina,
Ron DeSantis of Florida and Mark Meadows of North
Carolina.
If youd like to read more about the Freedom Caucus, I recommend
articles in the
Wall Street Journal
and
National Review.
Thank you ,
