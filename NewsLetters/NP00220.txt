Dear Friend:
I&#39;m protecting federal investments that benefit families and businesses in the Lower Hudson Valley. Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve been working for you in the U.S. House of Representatives&#58;
&#8226;
Fighting to renew the Ex&#45;Im Bank charter to
benefit local businesses
&#8226;
Opposing cuts to
vital transportation infrastructure investments
&#8226;

&#8226;
Calling attention to
Alzheimer&#39;s&#44; autism&#44; and other brain diseases
&#8226;
Ensuring
equal treatment under the law
for the LGBT community
&#8226;

get his World War II medals
Fighting to renew the Ex&#45;Im Bank charter to benefit local businesses
The Export&#45;Import Bank &#40;Ex&#45;Im&#41; helps American companies export the best brand in the world &#45; &#39;Made in America.&#39; Twenty&#45;two Westchester and Rockland companies have benefitted from roughly &#36;1.9 billion in guaranteed Ex&#45;Im financing&#44; yielding a total export value of &#36;2.2 billion and supporting more than
14&#44;000 jobs
. Ex&#45;Im&#39;s charter expires at the end of this month&#44; and that could mean job losses not only for those exporters&#44; but also their extensive supply chains. We simply cannot put American workers at a disadvantage by allowing dozens of foreign export banks to siphon U.S. jobs to distant shores. I will be working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives on a long&#45;term extension of this job&#45;creating government agency.
Opposing cuts to vital transportation infrastructure investments
This week&#44; I opposed a bill passed by the House that would slash transportation infrastructure investments for 2016&#44; including cutting Amtrak by &#36;1.3 billion below what is needed. Republicans also refused to include any funding for Positive Train Control&#44; which the National Transportation Safety Board has said would have prevented last month&#39;s derailment in Philadelphia. Despite the fact that our infrastructure needs are increasing&#44; the bill would take a giant step backward. We cannot meet tomorrow&#39;s challenges by slashing investments in highways&#44; bridges&#44; transit&#44; and air traffic modernization.
Protecting families from gun violence
There is much more Congress should be doing to prevent senseless loss of life as a result of gun violence. During a Northern Westchester 15th Anniversary celebration of the Million Mom March &#45; a national grassroots movement to call attention to the need for improved gun safety measures &#45; I was honored to receive the Apple Pie Award for my work in the House to prevent gun violence. I was also proud to wear orange to support National Gun Violence Awareness Day on June 2&#44; 2015. Families across the country are fed up with inaction on gun violence prevention&#44; and I will continue working with national and local groups to ensure all Americans have the right to live in safe and secure communities.
I was in Northern Westchester to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of the Million Mom March &#40;top&#41; with original march organizers Jill Brooke&#44; Donna Dees&#45;Thomases&#44; and Elise Richman. I joined Secretary Hillary Clinton and former Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy at the original Million Mom March &#40;bottom&#41; on Mother&#39;s Day 2000 that drew 750&#44;000 people to the National Mall in Washington&#44; DC&#44; in support of preventing gun violence.
Calling attention to Alzheimer&#39;s&#44; autism&#44; and other debilitating brain diseases
June is Alzheimer&#39;s and Brain Awareness Month&#44; an opportunity to join a global conversation about the brain and call attention to the importance of research to combat brain diseases and disorders. Alzheimer&#39;s is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States and women make up more than two&#45;thirds of Americans with Alzheimer&#39;s. Autism affects more than three million Americans&#44; and incidence rates have gone from 1 in 150 ten years ago to 1 in 68 today. As Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I will continue to fight for increased investments in the National Institutes of Health because research can help us better understand&#44; treat&#44; and ultimately prevent debilitating brain diseases and disorders.
I met with representatives from the Alzheimer&#39;s Association to discuss the importance of federal investments in research to better understand&#44; treat&#44; and ultimately prevent debilitating brain diseases.
Ensuring equal treatment under the law for the LGBT community
June is lesbian&#44; gay&#44; bisexual&#44; and transgender &#40;LGBT&#41; Pride Month&#44; when we honor the tireless determination and enduring struggle of our LGBT community. In the face of bigotry&#44; discrimination&#44; and violence&#44; the LGBT rights movement has persevered to make remarkable progress in bringing equality to 37 states and the District of Columbia. Despite this success&#44; the pursuit for nationwide marriage equality continues&#58; the Supreme Court is currently considering a case that may confirm the constitutionality of same&#45;sex marriage. I was proud to join an amicus brief in support of marriage equality in this case because I believe
equal treatment under the law is a bedrock principle
of our Republic. I will continue working hard to ensure that all Americans have the right to marry the ones they love.
Helping a veteran get his World War II medals
A Chappaqua woman alerted me that her father&#44; Dr. Samuel Rosmarin&#44; did not receive his medals from serving in the United States Army during World War II. I wrote to the Department of Defense on Dr. Rosmarin&#39;s behalf. Soon thereafter&#44; the U.S. Department of the Army informed me that he was entitled to the World War II Victory Medal&#44; the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp&#44; and the Honorable Service Lapel Button&#45;World War II. It was a great honor to present Dr. Rosmarin his medals at my White Plains district office.
