Dear
Friends,
As we begin this new year, we can reflect on what
we have achieved and forge new goals for 2015.Throughout my years in
Congress, Ive worked with my Congressional colleagues to find
bipartisan solutions to some of the most challenging problems facing
our community, and this year, I am committed to continuing to work
hard for South Florida and our nation.
In 2014, we faced
many challenges both at home and abroad.
However, Congress came
together to address many of these issues, proving that bipartisanship
is still alive, even in a divided government.
By co-sponsoring
the
EARLY Act Reauthorization , I helped to expand
support for public education campaigns regarding breast health and fund
essential research for the prevention of breast cancer. I was also
proud to co-sponsor the
Achieving a Better Life Experience
Act
(ABLE Act), which will allow individuals with disabilities
and their family members to better plan their financial future by
giving them access to tax-free savings accounts. Additionally, I was
honored to support the
Veterans Access, Choice, and
Accountability Act of 2014.
This law will allow
those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom to receive health
care outside the VA system when the quality and availability of care
our veterans deserve would not otherwise be available to
them.
Important progress in the fight for the advancement of human
rights and democracy worldwide was also achieved in 2014.
With my
support, the
United States-Israel Partnership
Act
became a law .
This law strengthens our
commitment to Israel as it continues forging a free and independent Jewish
state in the face of relentless terrorist opposition.
I also
helped ensure that the
Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and
Civil Society Act
became law.
This measure addresses the
lack of human rights and democracy in Venezuela by
penalizing human rights violators and demonstrates that the U.S. will stand in
solidarity with those who seek freedom and justice.
Conversely, the
President pursued what I believe to be a misguided policy on
Cuba, which will leave opposition leaders without important support
from our nation and will empower the Castros' dictatorial
regime. This year I am committed to stopping the administrations changes
to U.S.- Cuba policy, which in my opinion only serve to benefit
the Castro regime.
In 2015, I will continue to
promote legislation in Congress to help South Florida families, improve our
economy, provide better care for our veterans, and ensure that our
children receive the best education possible.
2015 will
undoubtedly be a year of new opportunities and challenges, but with
hard work and determination, I know we can make South Florida a better
place to live. Happy New Year!
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
