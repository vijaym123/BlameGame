VISITING DC
April 11, 2014
This
week, I joined Chuck Todd on The Daily Rundown to discuss the
obstacles facing our nations veterans.
To watch, click the video
above or visit my
Youtube page .
Last
evening, Senator Alexander and I took to the floor to warn that the
unionization of college athletes, as permitted by a recent National Labor
Relations Board regional decision, would destroy college sports and
harm the entire American system of higher education.
I am a
former scholarship football player for Wake Forest University. College
sports is a lot about the experience.
I carry around
memories of the summer practices that lasted from sun up to sun down and
the memory every football player has of that dead grass in summer
practice in hot weather.
College sports builds character.
It
builds integrity.
It builds drive.
It builds resilience.
It's not the only thing in life that does it, but to me,
for many young men and women, it is an effective way for them to
become leaders.
Although the idea of unionizing might sound
good to a very small number of student-athletes considering doing so,
it is important we think of the 99% of student-athletes who never
reach the professional levels of their respective sports and will come to
value the education they received while competing for their colleges
or universities.
The value of that education
more than any
temporary benefit they might receive while collectively bargaining
will
bring a lifetime of higher earnings in their profession but also a
respect for the life lessons they received while playing sports for their
schools.
I hope the NLRBs regional offices decision does not
threaten that for these students.
