Recent Awards and Achievements in the 11th
District
Congratulations to Dana Elementary School in Hendersonville for
being named a 21st Century Learning Exemplar School by the
Partnership for 21st Century Skills . In May, I had the
opportunity to visit Dana Elementary and see their innovative
teaching techniques firsthand. To learn more Dana's successful model,
check out this video .
On Friday, it was an honor to present numerous medals to the
families of two 11th District World War II veterans. Lenoir Mayor Joe
Gibbs, members of the Caldwell County Veterans Honor Guard, and
Caldwell County Veterans Services officials joined the families of Harrison
Benfield and George Washington Johnson to honor the service these men
gave to our nation.
Congratulations to
Murphy High School's football team for their win on Friday night to
secure a spot in the North Carolina State Championship. The 11th District
will be rooting for the Bulldogs next Saturday!
Events and
Visits
Thank you to Major General Lusk and his colleagues from the
North Carolina National Guard for visiting my DC office this week. We had
a great discussion about the most beneficial ways for our National
Guard to handle sequestration as well as the importance of protecting our
National Guard families who do so much for our
nation.
It was a pleasure to welcome the students of Heritage Middle
School in Valdese to the nation's capital on
Wednesday.
On Friday morning, I had a chance to visit Rugby
Middle School in Hendersonville. I always end up learning more from the
students than they learn from me!
Debbie and I had great time
participating in Christmas parades in Hendersonville, Cherokee, and
Lenoir this weekend. Thank you for allowing us to be part of the
celebration.
From our family to yours, we pray you are
enjoying the start of the Christmas season in Western North
Carolina!
