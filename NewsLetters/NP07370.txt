Friends
Im sorry to have to do this on a Friday night, but as it turns out, the House of Representatives is going to be voting late into the night tonight in Washington.
Weve got legislation pending to address the problems at our border, and that issue is very important.
As you might know, weve got another round of Congress on the Corner meetings scheduled tomorrow in Jeff Davis, Appling, and Coffee Counties.
While Id rather be down in the district meeting with folks, theres just no way Ill be able to make it down in time for our Congress on the Corners.
Im sorry to have to do this, but I promise well reschedule these meetings for another weekend. Its very important to me that we have the opportunity to visit as often as possible, so please keep an eye out for the new dates.
If you were planning on attending, and would still like to, members of our staff are going to be at each location throughout the day to visit with you.
Folks come to these meetings looking for help with federal agencies, and in some cases, our staff is able to intervene on their behalf to solve a problem.
Thanks for your understanding, and please dont hesitate to contact me if I can be of help.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
