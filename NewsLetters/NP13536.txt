2013 Constituent Survey
Dear Friend,
As a new member of Congress, I want to know what you think about the issues facing our country so I can better represent you in Washington, DC.
Like many Americans, I am tired of the partisan bickering and lack of governing in Washington. Whether it's by supporting a Farm Bill that cuts spending and reforms vital farm programs, reducing government overregulation or supporting necessary transportation projects, I am committed to passing legislation needed to promote private sector job creation and grow our struggling economy. I came to Congress with my children's future in mind
we must pass a budget and control our spending now so we can leave a better America to future generations.
But I want to hear from you. Please take a few minutes to complete
this online survey
to register your opinion.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Rodney Davis
Member of Congress
