Dear Friends,
The path forward for our nation and the economy is centered on addressing health care costs through improved patient care. In order to accomplish this, we must leverage the best our private and public sectors have to offer, through science, technology and innovation.
Connecticut remains on the national forefront of our changing health care landscape. On
Monday, July 7th , I will join together health care leaders in the state, including representatives of our insurance industry, hospitals, and Jackson Laboratory President and CEO Ed Liu, to explore key questions around science and innovation in health care, how science is driving change, and implications for health care costs.

Legislative Office Building, Room 2C
Monday, July 7th, 11:30AM &ndash; 1:30PM
