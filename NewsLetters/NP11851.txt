Dear Friend,
Last Friday, a non-partisan agency within the Obama Administration
reported that two-thirds of small businesses employees will see their
health insurance premiums rise due to ObamaCare.
This is simply unacceptable. It is completely unfair to those
hardworking individuals and families who, thanks to ObamaCare, will
take home less of their hard-earned money. They don't deserve to see
their paychecks sliced and diced by an unworkable, unwanted and
unaffordable health care law. As the full weight of ObamaCare comes
crashing down on small businesses, another 11 million Americans will be
squeezed or even crushed beneath its exorbitant costs. That's why we
need to replace this law with a free-market, patient-centered
alternative like the American Health Care Reform Act. Click HERE

No New Taxes
This week I said "No" to new taxes by co-sponsoring the Internet Tax
Freedom Act, which would make the current ban on state and local
internet access taxes permanent.
My position on tax policy is clear: no new taxes. The last thing this
country needs is new taxes, especially on internet access. As the
internet becomes an increasingly central part of modern life, Congress
must protect the ability of millions of Americans to access online job
applications, health care information, online marketplaces and
educational platforms through the internet. This commonsense, one-line
bill simply makes the current ban on state and local internet access
taxes permanent. Click HERE

Protecting Access to Rural Health Care
On Thursday, I became a co-sponsor of the Critical Access Hospital
Relief Act of 2014, which would repeal the 96 hour pre-certification
rule that requires physicians at Critical Access Hospitals to
pre-certify when a patient is admitted that they do not expect the
patient to stay more than 96 hours. If the physician cannot certify
this, the patient must be transferred or the hospital will not receive
reimbursement from the federal government.
As a health care provider for 25 years, I know the 96 hour
pre-certification rule is absurd and jeopardizes the health of anyone
living in a rural community. In the Fourth District, this threat is all
too real, as the nearest hospital in some areas is almost 100 miles
away. Folks who are sick and need immediate medical attention shouldn't
be turned away just because the doctor can't say with absolute
certainty they won't require care for more than 96 hours.
This dangerous new guidance, which was created and is enforced by
faceless bureaucrats in Washington, interferes with the
patient-physician relationship; these bureaucrats aren't considering
what's best for the patient. This only exacerbates the problems that
rural communities already face when it comes to accessing quality care
and recruiting high quality physicians. If physicians are no longer
reimbursed for providing their services as a result of this new
regulation, then quality doctors will no longer seek employment at
Critical Access Hospitals. Click HERE

Government Waste of the Week
$67 billion: the amount that could have been saved had managers at
federal agencies implemented more than 16,000 cost-saving
recommendations from non-partisan Inspectors General.
Congressional District 4: Did You Know?
Of 3 million cities surveyed in Google's recent publication of its
Sightsmap, Lake Havasu City ranked 3,922 and Oatman ranked 4,530 of the

Supervisor Buster Johnson, who has too much time on his hands
apparently.) One of those pictures of Oatman appears below, courtesy of

Dear
Friend,
Last
Friday,
a
non-partisan
agency
within
the
Obama
Administration
reported
that
two-thirds
of
small
businesses
employees
will
see
their
health
insurance
premiums
rise
due
to
ObamaCare. This
is
simply
unacceptable.
It
is
completely
unfair
to
those
hardworking
individuals
and
families
who,
thanks
to
ObamaCare,
will
take
home
less
of
their
hard-earned
money.
They
don&#8217;t
deserve
to
see
their
paychecks
sliced
and
diced
by
an
unworkable,
unwanted
and
unaffordable
health
care
law.
As
the
full
weight
of
ObamaCare
comes
crashing
down
on
small
businesses,
another
11
million
Americans
will
be
squeezed
or
even
crushed
beneath
its
exorbitant
costs. That's
why
we
need
to replace
this
law
with
a

Protecting
Access
to
Rural
Health
Care
On
Thursday,
I
became
a
co-sponsor
of
the
Critical
Access
Hospital
Relief
Act
of
2014,
which
would
repeal
the
96
hour
pre-certification
rule
that
requires
physicians
at
Critical
Access
Hospitals
to
pre-certify
when
a
patient
is
admitted
that
they
do
not
expect
the
patient
to
stay
more
than
96
hours.
If
the
physician
cannot
certify
this,
the
patient
must
be
transferred
or
the
hospital
will
not
receive
reimbursement
from
the
federal
government.
As
a
health
care
provider
for
25
years,
I
know
the
96
hour
pre-certification
rule
is
absurd
and
jeopardizes
the
health
of
anyone
living
in
a
rural
community.
In
the
Fourth
District,
this
threat
is
all
too
real,
as
the
nearest
hospital
in
some
areas
is
almost
100
miles
away.
Folks
who
are
sick
and
need
immediate
medical
attention
shouldn&#8217;t
be
turned
away
just
because
the
doctor
can&#8217;t
say
with
absolute
certainty
they
won&#8217;t
require
care
for
more
than
96
hours.
This
dangerous
new
guidance,
which
was
created
and
is
enforced
by
faceless
bureaucrats
in
Washington,
interferes
with
the
patient-physician
relationship;
these
bureaucrats
aren&#8217;t
considering
what&#8217;s
best
for
the
patient.
This
only
exacerbates
the
problems
that
rural
communities
already
face
when
it
comes
to
accessing
quality
care
and
recruiting
high
quality
physicians.
If
physicians
are
no
longer
reimbursed
for
providing
their
services
as
a
result
of this
new
regulation,
then
quality
doctors
will
no
longer
seek
employment
at
Critical
Access
Hospitals.
