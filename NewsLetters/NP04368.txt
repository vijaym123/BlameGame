Garrett discusses President Obama's unconstitutional
amnesty announcement with Stuart Varney.
Dear Friend,
After repeated admissions that the Constitution precludes him from granting amnesty, President Obama has chosen to cast aside his oath to uphold the supreme law of the land and is going to grant amnesty anyway. The presidents frustration with Congress, as the Washington Posts editorial board noted, doesnt grant the president license to tear up the Constitution. No provision of the Constitution grants the president the power to change the law simply because he disagrees with Congress. This sets a fatal precedent
is there no longer any limit to a presidents power?
President Obama has also turned his back on American workers and law-abiding immigrants. At a time when American workers are desperate for jobs, the president has decided to unfairly reward those who have blatantly broken the law with blanket amnesty and work permits.
I am committed to undoing the damage this unconstitutional action will have on our republic.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
