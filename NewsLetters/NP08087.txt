OVERRIDE THE SUPREME COURT&rsquo;S BIRTH CONTROL DECISION &gt;&gt;
The Supreme Court decided that corporations can deny women birth control coverage. But now, Democrats in Congress have developed legislation overriding the Supreme Court&rsquo;s wrong-headed decision. A woman&rsquo;s boss should NOT have control over her health care decisions. Please sign our petition calling for an override of the Supreme Court. NAME: David Johnson

David -- This is despicable:
Five Supreme Court Justices -- all of them men -- decided that a corporation&rsquo;s beliefs can override a woman&rsquo;s access to contraceptive coverage. You would think we were in the 1950s. A woman&rsquo;s boss should not be in control of her health care decisions. No one's boss should.
That&rsquo;s why Democrats in Congress have developed legislation that would override the Supreme Court&rsquo;s wrong-headed decision. We want to get 100,000 signatures to show that there&rsquo;s public support for preserving women&rsquo;s basic health care rights. OVERRIDE THE SUPREME COURT:
Please sign this petition declaring that a woman&rsquo;s boss should not have a say in her health care decisions &gt;&gt;
The Hobby Lobby decision allows certain corporations to use religious beliefs -- and faulty medical science -- as a weapon against their female employees&rsquo; rights. It&rsquo;s unacceptable.
We can&rsquo;t sit idly by while corporations refuse to respect women&rsquo;s rights. SIGN YOUR NAME:
