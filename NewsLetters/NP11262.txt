Visit to Local
School
Wednesday, I was able to
attend Heritage Middle School and take part in a Mock Congress the
teachers have created to help teach the students about the legislative
process. I was truly impressed by the students interest and depth of
understanding. I also applaud the teachers for coming up with an
interactive lesson to encourage creativity and
participation.
Its always a special occasion when I get to
visit with students. Our children - both mine and yours
are why my
colleagues and I are working every day to make this country a better
place. Americas youth will be our next leaders and will have to deal with
the policies established today. We need to help cultivate fresh ideas
and new ways of looking at issues in order to drive innovation and
improve the way in which we govern. I want our children to be able to
enjoy their freedoms, establish fulfilling careers, and pursue the
American Dream, just as my generation and those before me were able to
do.

Honoring Acts of
Service
Quinten Curtis is a
4th grader from Granite Falls who demonstrated the true spirit of
Christmas and reminded us all of the importance of giving back to the
community. For Christmas, Quinten had only two requests: a clarinet and 100
cans of food for the South Caldwell Christian Ministries. Not only did
Quinten serve as an exemplary role model for us all, but he also far
surpassed his goal by collecting over 1300 cans of food for those in
need, which was matched mutliple times by members of the community. I
had the pleasure of presenting him with a copy of the Congressional
Record commemorating his
efforts.
Amos Rutherford celebrated his 100th birthday March 15th and he is the
oldest living World War II veteran of Caldwell County. Rutherford
joined the U.S. Army in 1942, where he served as a private first class in
the 853rd Port Company until 1946. For his continuing service to our
great nation, Rutherford was awarded with the WWII Honorable Service
Lapel Button and the WWII Victory Medal, which I had the honor of
presenting to him. A portion of the Victory Medal represents courage and
fortitude, which Rutherford exemplified through and
through.
Four
Year Anniversary of
Obamacare
Shortly before Obamacare was passed in the House,
then Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously said, [W]e have to pass the bill
so you can find out what is in it. Even if Pelosi and the other
members of Congress did read the bill, the current implementation of
Obamacare would be close to unrecognizable.
This is largely because
the 828 pages of Obamacare were just a drop in the bucket compared to
the over 20,000 pages of federal regulations.
According to industry experts, healthcare costs are
expected to increase dramatically next year
anywhere from 40% -
300%. Despite its name, this law is not affordable for anyone. Its no
wonder the Obama Administration has been forced to create loopholes to
the individual mandate, which is also the primary reason why costs are
increasing.
Just how has
President Obama made it easy to avoid the individual mandate? Well, it
can be as simple as claiming you had a hardship in obtaining
healthcare. This requires no documentation, opening the flood gates to mass
exemption requests and potential fraud. While I oppose Obamacare and its
individual mandate, I also believe the President must faithfully
execute federal laws in accordance with the Constitution. That is why I
will continue working to repeal and replace Obamacare with
patient-centered healthcare.
