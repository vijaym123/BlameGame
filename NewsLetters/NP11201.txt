Dear
Friends,
The president signed into law a fix
for skyrocketing flood insurance premiums for new homeowners last
week, legislation first passed by the House of Representatives a few weeks
ago.
The
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 would treat new homebuyers
the same as previous owners, ensuring that new homebuyers wont face
skyrocketing premiums when buying new homes. It also would repeal the
Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Acts rate increases for
properties purchased after July 6, 2012, returning them to their 2012 rates
and making the transition to new actuarial rates more affordable for
homeowners.
I
helped push the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act
successfully through the House after hearing from West Virginians facing
astronomical increases in their flood insurance premiums. In Tuesday's
Charleston Daily Mail, I explained how this situation came to be and how I
worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fix this
problem.

DISASTER DECLARATION
On Tuesday, I
joined my fellow members of West Virginia's congressional delegation in
sending a letter to President Obama and FEMA Administrator Craig
Fugate in support of Governor Earl Ray Tomblin's request for a major
disaster declaration for West Virginia in the wake of the Jan. 9 chemical
spill.
The chemical spill also greatly impacted our economy,
our school systems, our hospitals, and many of our businesses across
the affected region. While estimates of the impact to our economy have
been calculated at $61 million, we expect the likely total economic
impact to be far greater. School systems lost a significant amount of
instructional days. Hospitals were forced to reschedule visits by their
patients. Our businesses saw substantial revenue loss, while
incurring vast costs to clean their facilities and recover from this crisis,
we wrote to the president and Administrator Fugate.
AMERICAN
LEGION
I met with West Virginia members of the American Legion
on Tuesday and discussed ways to help our veterans, including
reducing the claims backlog. I thank each and every one of them for their
continued service to our nation and our veterans.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
