Passover Wishes from Congressman Scott Perry
As our Jewish friends in America, Israel, and around the world mark the start of Passover tonight, I wish you a blessed celebration surrounded by family and loved ones. Passover commemorates the great Exodus of the Jewish people from Egypt thousands of years ago, but its also a celebration of the triumph of freedom over oppression and is as meaningful today as ever.
Happy Passover and Chag Sameach!
Respectfully,
Scott G. Perry
