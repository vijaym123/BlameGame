Dear Friend,
With severe weather season upon us, I wanted to take a moment to share
some ideas on how to stay safe if and when those sirens warn of severe
weather and possible twisters.
On average, tornadoes kill about 60 people each year in the United
States. That average climbed to extremely high levels in 2011, with the
deaths of 158 people in the massive tornado that ripped through Joplin
in southwest Missouri.
Tornadoes are violent and capable of destroying homes and other
well-made structures, uprooting trees, and sending debris flying
through the air.
Missouri's State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) offers valuable
advice on how to prepare for and act during tornadoes. It advises that
if you see a funnel cloud nearby, take shelter immediately. But if you
spot a tornado that's far away, take the time to help alert others by
reporting it to a local radio or TV station before taking shelter.
The key to survival in many cases is to have an emergency plan in place
- and then prepare and practice how to react if and when a tornado
strikes. It's a good idea to designate a safe place at home where your
family can gather until the danger passes. This safe place could be a
basement or storm cellar. If there is no basement, SEMA advises
Missourians to go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level
and to stay away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. It
also suggests getting under a sturdy table and to protect heads from
possible debris.
SEMA further advises that after the tornado, citizens should assume all
downed power lines are live and should be avoided. It encourages people
who are trying to get to safety or are involved in rescue operations to
wear sturdy, hard-soled shoes or boots, long sleeves and gloves when
walking near debris to prevent injuries from such things as nails and
glass. Use flashlights and other battery-operated light sources, but
avoid lighting candles or matches as gas might be present and open
flames could lead to explosions.
SEMA's website offers valuable advice on potentially life-saving
tornado preparedness. It also has information on assistance that is
available to victims of tornadoes. The website is
http://sema.dps.mo.gov/
. SEMA can also be contacted by phone at573-529-9100. Remember,
acting quickly can save lives.

Vicky Hartzler

Dear
