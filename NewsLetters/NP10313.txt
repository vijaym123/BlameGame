Dear friends,
This week,
President Obama and Attorney General Holder once again showed their disregard
for our nations laws and their refusal to follow the system of checks
and balances enshrined in our Constitution.
This time, the
Administration is eroding our criminal justice system with an
unprecedented action - soliciting applications for clemency from a specific
class of federal offenders: in this case, non-violent drug
offenders.
According to the Administration, many of these offenders are
serving disproportionally long prison terms.
I agree that we need to
rethink how we sentence first time non-violent drug offenders.
The problem is that the Administration is taking this action without
Congressional authorization.
Only Congress has the power to
change our criminal sentencing laws, but the Administration is moving ahead
without us.
The irony is that I have already introduced
legislation to bring common sense to our criminal sentencing laws,
empowering judges to determine, on an individual basis, whether the
harshest sentences should apply for certain non-violent offenders.
The
name of my bill is the
Smarter Sentencing
Act ,
and have I introduced it with my colleague, Rep. Bobby
Scott (D-VA).
Today, it has 26 cosponsors in both
parties.
A Senate version of the bill
introduced by Sen. Richard Durbin
(D-IL) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) has already passed the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Organizations from across the political spectrum have
endorsed our bill
the NAACP, the ACLU, Heritage Action, the
Constitution Project, among many others.
And yet
despite
the bipartisan work thats already been achieved, and despite the
momentum that weve managed to create
the Administration refuses to work
with us.
Theyve chosen to go off on their own, break the law,
and further erode whatever trust still exists between Congress and the
White House.
I confronted Attorney General Holder about this
strategy at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee earlier this
month.
I told Mr. Holder, One area where we agree is on the
Smarter Sentencing Act
[but] you make my job more difficult when
you act unilaterally - as you haveand try to do the same thing
through memos that were trying to accomplish through this legislationSo
Im extending to you my hand right now, to work with you to help pass
the
Smarter Sentencing Act.
But could you please help me
try to pass the
Smarter Sentencing Act
by not going around
the lawbut actually working with Congress?
As you
can see in the video (watch
here ), the Attorney
General didnt really answer my question.
And the action he took
this week - reassigning dozens of attorneys to his Pardon Attorneys
Office to accommodate the expected surge in clemency applications shows
that he is not serious about working with Congress and getting the job
done.
I really dont understand the logic of this
Administration.
Even in situations where Republicans and Democrats are
working together in a bipartisan way to implement policies that the
Administration itself favors
and even in situation where we are making
progress in achieving a common goal
the Administration decides to
act unilaterally, go around Congress, and prevent us from achieving a
real, long-term solution
I will continue to champion the
Smarter Sentencing Act
its a good bill and Im proud of the
support its getting from across the political spectrum
but the
Administration is making it harder, not easier, to make it the law of the
land.
And on bigger issues
from health care to immigration to
the debt
its impossible to see much progress until the President
starts acting in a more transparent and responsible
way.
