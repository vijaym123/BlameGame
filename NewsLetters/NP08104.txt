Another Atrocity from
Hamas
6/30/14
Following the news that Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali
Frenkel, and American citizen and also 16, were murdered today by Hamas
terrorists, Congressman Doug Lamborn issued the following
statement:
" For these things I weep; mine
eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that
should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because
the enemy prevailed (Lamentations 1:16)."
"The three
Israeli students who were kidnapped were found dead near Hebron. No words
will console the families of these young boys in their awful grief. At
this time we must stay strong and
support our Israeli brothers in this difficult
hour."
"Speechless as I find myself, this is time for action. One of the boys is one
of our own, an American citizen. I call on President Obama to hold the
Palestinian Authority responsible; to halt all funding of the PA
until President Abbas eliminates the Palestinian unity government and
hunts down all that are responsible for this horrific act of terror. This
is the time to extend our hand to Israel, join forces and give PM
Netanyahu the necessary support to abolish Hamas and bring an end to their
act of terror."
