Dealing With Putin's Aggression
I recently wrote an opinion article regarding the situation in Ukraine. America has many options, short of armed conflict, that we can and should pursue to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin's territorial aggression.
I was honored that the Lebanon Daily News, the Morning Call, the Patriot News and The Hill.com all published my op-ed. You can read it
here .
