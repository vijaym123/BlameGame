LEGISLATION
May 17, 2015
Dear
David,
This past
week, our nation celebrated Peace Officer Memorial Dayan opportunity
for us all to honor and appreciate the men and women in law
enforcement who work to keep our communities safe. Since January of this year,
44 police officers lost their lives in the line of duty. In the North
State, this reality hits close to home. This past week, Placer County
Sheriffs visited to DC to honor their fallen colleague, Detective
Michael Davis Jr., who lost his life while protecting his community from a
horrific crime spree last October.
I am committed to
supporting those who protect us. Last week, the House passed four measures
to support and protect our heroes in blue.
S. 665
establishes a national Blue Alert communications
network within the Department of Justice to disseminate information among
Federal, State and local governments, and law enforcement agencies
when an officer is seriously injured, killed, missing, or in imminent
danger. Two measures included would improve benefits to reflect the
dangerous nature of a police officers duty.
H.R. 2146
allows peace officers to make penalty-free
withdrawals from their defined benefit and defined contribution retirement
accounts after they reach age 50, and
H.R. 606
would exclude death benefits from being subject to federal
income tax for surviving dependents of an officer killed in the line
of duty. To honor those who give the ultimate sacrifrice,
H.R. 723
authorizes members of the House of
Representatives to honor the lives of fallen officers with a U.S. flag
flown over the Capitol. These measures are just a small token of our
deep gratitude.
Below are some recent highlights from DC and
around our district. To stay in touch with me throughout the week and
to share your thoughts with me, follow me on
Facebook
and email me via my
website .
Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa visits with members of the Placer County
Sheriffs Department and their families during Police Week to discuss
recent House legislation to support Peace
Officers.
Rep. LaMalfa is
awarded with a gold rating by ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp at the
American Conservative Unions 44th Annual Awards Presentation. Rep. LaMalfa
was honored for his voting record in support of a constitutionally
limited government, individual liberty, free markets, a strong national
defense and traditional
values.
Rep. LaMalfa speaks at
the Western Growers' Board meeting to discuss challenges facing
agriculture in California. The Western Growers Association represents local
and regional family farmers who grow half the nations fresh fruits
and vegetables including a third of Americas fresh organic produce.
Rep. LaMalfa discusses a number of recent
actions in the House of Representatives in support of agriculture,
including
H.R. 1732 , which passed
by a vote of 261-155 and
rolls back the Environmental Protection Agencys controversial
Waters of the United States regulatory proposal power grab over
water.
Rep. LaMalfa visits the North State Food Bank in Oroville.
This program serves Butte, Glenn, Colusa, Plumas, and Sierra counties
in a continued effort to fight hunger in Northern California. As part
of the Agriculture Committee's thorough and thoughtful review of
SNAP, also known as Food Stamps, committee members are visiting food banks
in their congressional districts to get a clear understanding of the
relationship between the Food Stamp program and the many charitable
organizations that work to feed the
hungry.
