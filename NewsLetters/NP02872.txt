Celebrating Black History Month
Every February, we honor the great achievements and rich history of African Americans and the African American community. We also reflect on the past indignities of slavery and segregation, prejudice and discrimination. That is why it is important that we take this time each year to recommit ourselves to the collective goal of ensuring equality and justice for all people.
