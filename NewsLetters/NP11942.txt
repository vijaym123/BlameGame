Dear
David,
Can you believe
this?
"Theres plenty of horror stories being told
[about ObamaCare].
All of them are untrue.
But theyre being
told all over America."
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
(Nev.)
Since November 2013, I have gone to the Senate floor
on a regular basis to
read directly
from
the stories that Ive received from Missourians who have been hurt by
ObamaCare.

to watch my floor
speeches.
Does Leader Reid believe Missourians are making
this up?
The truth is: thanks to ObamaCare, millions of Americans
have lost coverage, lost jobs, lost doctors, and must pay higher health
insurance premiums and deductibles they cannot
afford.
Recently, the Obama Administration announced it would make drastic cuts
to Medicare Advantage
hurting nearly 15 million seniors nationwide
and nearly
237,000 seniors
in Missouri who are on
the program. This week, I joined my fellow Senate Republican leaders
in a
letter
calling on U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to suspend the
administrations misguided policies.
Ill continue
fighting to repeal ObamaCare because its bad for seniors, families,
employers, and workers in Missouri and nationwide.
I want to hear how this law is impacting you.
