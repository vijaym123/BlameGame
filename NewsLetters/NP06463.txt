Dear Friend,
As I meet with individuals and small
businesses across Ohios 16
th
District, I continue to hear
about the negative effects of the
Presidents health care law. Whether
its a hardworking family forced to
pay higher premiums or an individual whose
hours were reduced as a direct result of
the laws employer mandate, the
people of Ohios 16
th
District are suffering from
the laws unintended consequences.
Though the Affordable Care Act was signed
into law more than four years ago, we have
yet to see the full extent of the
laws impact on small businesses,
individuals premiums, the health
care industry, and our nations
deficit. Next month, in addition to
learning that their premiums have
increased, another wave of Americans will
learn that their health care plans will be
cancelled.
Last fall, millions of Americans across
the country received notices from their
insurance providers that their health plans
were cancelled. Individuals lost access to
their trusted physicians and many were
forced to choose from narrow network plans.
Though cancellations were concentrated in
the individual insurance market last year,
there is evidence that those who receive
coverage through their employer may soon
face a similar fate.
During an Energy and Commerce Committee
hearing in July, industry experts testified
that approximately 50 million American
workers with fully-insured coverage face
plan cancellations or disruptions due rules
and regulations within the
Presidents health care law.
Additionally, last year, Forbes issued a
warning stating, Starting in October
2014, many employees of small businesses
will start getting the same notices that
are now being mailed to individuals,
informing them that their existing health
plans are also being cancelled.
In January of 2009, President Obama
said, If you like your doctor, you
will be able to keep your doctor, period.
If you like your health plan, youll
be able to keep your health plan,
period. President Obama repeated
this promise for years, misleading
Americans throughout the country. In 2013,
Politifact dubbed President Obamas
promise the Lie of the Year,
citing that cancellation letters went out
to approximately 4 million Americans as of
December.
We in the House of Representatives are
committed to ensuring that if you like your
health care plan, you can keep it
just like the President promised. In
November 2013, we passed H.R. 3350, the
Keep Your Health Plan Act. This legislation
allowed insurance plans that were available
on the individual market last year to be
offered the following year, providing
millions of Americans the opportunity to
keep their health plans in 2014.
In order to address cancellations in the
group insurance market, the House of
Representatives voted this week to approve
the Employee Health Care Protection Act, a
bill that allows American workers who
receive coverage through their employer the
opportunity to keep their health plans
through 2019, giving small businesses and
their employers the option to keep the
plans they like.
With the cost of day-to-day living on
the rise for hardworking Americans, the
last thing Ohio families need is their
health care plans cancelled and premiums
increased. It is critical that this
legislation is signed into law to eliminate
the threat of further plan cancellations,
and to preserve President Obamas
promise that if you like your health plan,
you can keep it.
