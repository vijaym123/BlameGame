Friends,
There is no greater duty we have as a nation than to care for our
veterans. Thousands of doctors, nurses, and public servants at the VA
work hard to give veteran patients the best healthcare we can offer.
But, too often, our system fails those it was created to help.
An outrageous backlog at the VA has caused veterans to wait months for
answers on disability claims. The same is true of VA medical services,
where waiting lists for some critical services are terribly long. In
some instances, veterans may have died waiting for health services from
the VA.
That is simply unacceptable in the United States of America, and we
need to do something about it. That's why I'm pleased the House of
Representatives on Thursday passed an appropriations bill
providing
critical funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, while also
seeking systemic changes to improve service.
This bi-partisan bill increases funding for veterans programs by $1.5
billion for fiscal year 2015 while remaining in line with recently
enacted budget caps. Specifically, the bill provides funding for
medical care, mental health services, suicide prevention activities,
traumatic brain injury treatment, homeless services and job training.
The bill also contains more than $344 million to modernize the VA
electronic health record system and more than $173 million to update
the paperless claims processing system - both of which are badly needed
to deal with the claims backlog.
As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
Appropriations Subcommittee, I was proud to work with my colleagues on
this funding measure that will ensure proper resources for our veteran
assistance programs. I'm also proud that the bill passed the full House
of Representatives by an overwhelming 416-1 vote.
Patient-Centered Community Care
Of course, money alone won't solve the backlog problems, which is why
the bill contains important measures increasing oversight of and
accountability within the Department of Veterans Affairs.
One way I believe we can greatly improve the timeliness and quality of
veteran health services is to further develop the Patient-Centered
Community Care program
, which allows the VA to
contract with local health providers. Some services that our veterans
need aren't always offered at their local VA hospital, or if they are,
the waiting list for service might be really long. In these cases, it
only makes sense for the VA to contract out services through local
providers and get the veteran patients the care they need.
I hear often from veterans who have been forced to wait a long time or
travel great distances because of gaps in the VA system. Why should a
Vietnam veteran and cancer patient in Ozark have to travel to Atlanta
for oncology treatments when a non-VA hospital or clinic closer by can
provide it? Why should an Iraq veteran in Tallassee who needs physical
therapy have to wait weeks or months for treatment at the VA when he
could be helped right away at a non-VA facility?
Under the Patient-Centered Community Care program, those alternative
treatment arrangements can be made on a contractual basis, reducing the
physical burdens on the veteran patients and actually reducing the
burden for taxpayers as well by eliminating unnecessary travel and
lodging costs. Everyone can agree that offering better care to veterans
while saving taxpayer money is a win-win situation.
Patient-Centered Community Care is still a relatively new program so it
is not yet widely available. We've asked the Department of Veterans
Affairs to document its successes and efficiencies so we can make the
case for allowing more veterans to take advantage of this innovative
program in the future.
The Week Ahead
Next week, the House will take further action to get answers on the IRS
targeting of conservative groups. We are expected to consider a
privileged resolution finding Lois Lerner, the former director of tax
exempt organizations at the IRS, in contempt of Congress for refusing
to comply with a subpoena issued by a Congressional committee. We will
also consider a resolution calling on the Justice Department to appoint
a special prosecutor in the IRS targeting scandal.
Additionally the House is expected to consider a bill to extend
research and development tax credits for American businesses so that
they can grow and invest in good paying jobs.
Specifically, the House is expected to consider:
*	H.R. 10
, the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter
Schools Act;
*	H.R. 4438
, the American Research and Competitiveness Act;
*	H. Res. 565
, Calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special
counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative non-profit groups
by the IRS; and
*	Resolution
Recommending that the House of Representatives find Lois G.
Lerner, in contempt of Congress.
As always, please stay in touch
and let us know what our office
can do for you.

There
is
no
greater
duty
we
have
as
a
nation
than
to
care
for
our
veterans.
Thousands
of
doctors,
nurses,
and
public
servants
at
the
VA
work
hard
to
give
veteran
patients
the
best
healthcare
we
can
offer.
But,
too
often,
our
system
fails
those
it
was
created
to
help.
An
outrageous
backlog
at
the
VA
has
caused
veterans
to
wait
months
for
answers
on
disability
claims.
The
same
is
true
of
VA
medical
services,
where
waiting
lists
for
some
critical
services
are
terribly
long.
In
some
instances,
veterans
may
have
died
waiting
for
health
services
from
the
VA.
That
is
simply
unacceptable
in
the
United
States
of
America,
and
we
need
to
do
something
about
it.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
pleased
the
House
of
Representatives
on
Thursday
passed
an
appropriations
bill
providing
critical
funding
for
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs,
while
also
seeking
systemic
changes
to
improve
service.
This
bi-partisan
bill
increases
funding
for
veterans
programs
by
$1.5
billion
for
fiscal
year
2015
while
remaining
in
line
with
recently
enacted
budget
caps.
Specifically,
the
bill
provides
funding
for
medical
care,
mental
health
services,
suicide
prevention
activities,
traumatic
brain
injury
treatment,
homeless
services
and
job
training.
The
bill
also
contains
more
than
$344
million
to
modernize
the
VA
electronic
health
record
system
and
more
than
$173
million
to
update
the
paperless
claims
processing
system
&#8211;
both
of
which
are
badly
needed
to
deal
with
the
claims
backlog.
As
a
member
of
the
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
was
proud
to
work
with
my
colleagues
on
this
funding
measure
that
will
ensure
proper
resources
for
our
veteran
assistance
programs.
I&#8217;m
also
proud
that
the
bill
passed
the
full
House
of
Representatives
by
an
overwhelming
416-1
vote.
Patient-Centered
Community
Care
Of
course,
money
alone
won&#8217;t
solve
the
backlog
problems,
which
is
why
the
bill
contains
important
measures
increasing
oversight
of
and
accountability
within
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
One
way
I
believe
we
can
greatly
improve
the
timeliness
and
quality
of
veteran
health
services
is
to
further
develop
the
Patient-Centered
Community
Care
program ,
which
allows
the
VA
to
contract
with
local
health
providers.
Some
services
that
our
veterans
need
aren&#8217;t
always
offered
at
their
local
VA
hospital,
or
if
they
are,
the
waiting
list
for
service
might
be
really
long.
In
these
cases,
it
only
makes
sense
for
the
VA
to
contract
out
services
through
local
providers
and
get
the
veteran
patients
the
care
they
need.
I
hear
often
from
veterans
who
have
been
forced
to
wait
a
long
time
or
travel
great
distances
because
of
gaps
in
the
VA
system.
Why
should
a
Vietnam
veteran
and
cancer
patient
in
Ozark
have
to
travel
to
Atlanta
for
oncology
treatments
when
a
non-VA
hospital
or
clinic
closer
by
can
provide
it?
Why
should
an
Iraq
veteran
in
Tallassee
who
needs
physical
therapy
have
to
wait
weeks
or
months
for
treatment
at
the
VA
when
he
could
be
helped
right
away
at
a
non-VA
facility?
Under
the
Patient-Centered
Community
Care
program,
those
alternative
treatment
arrangements
can
be
made
on
a
contractual
basis,
reducing
the
physical
burdens
on
the
veteran
patients
and
actually
reducing
the
burden
for
taxpayers
as
well
by
eliminating
unnecessary
travel
and
lodging
costs.
Everyone
can
agree
that
offering
better
care
to
veterans
while
saving
taxpayer
money
is
a
win-win
situation.
Patient-Centered
Community
Care
is
still
a
relatively
new
program
so
it
is
not
yet
widely
available.
We&#8217;ve
asked
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
document
its
successes
and
efficiencies
so
we
can
make
the
case
for
allowing
more
veterans
to
take

of
this
innovative
