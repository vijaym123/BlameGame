Rogers Votes to Block Taxpayer Funded Abortions
Applauds House Passage of the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015"
WASHINGTON, D.C.
- U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) voted to establish a government-wide halt on federal funding of abortion and applauded his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives for passing the
"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015" (H.R. 7) . This legislation comes on the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in 1973.
"On the anniversary of this landmark court decision, we ought to take a moment to reflect on the sanctity of human life. Millions of reported abortions have been performed in America since the decision was handed down in Roe v. Wade, and with Obamacare funding, taxpayer dollars are now paying for abortions through federal subsidies," said Rogers. "I was proud to support life by voting for this legislation, which aims to stop the use of any federal funding for abortions while mainstreaming this prohibition and closing all loopholes and exemptions."
Obamacare currently allows plans offered on the exchanges to cover elective abortions and authorizes taxpayer subsidies to be used to purchase plans covering these services. Additionally, it established federal tax credits to assist certain individuals in paying for health plans offered through the individual exchanges.
H.R. 7
blocks the funding in Obamacare, prohibiting the use of taxpayer dollars for abortion or health plans that cover abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger.
It does not prohibit the use of federal funds to treat complications that arise from or are exacerbated by an abortion, regardless of whether the abortion was performed legally.
The legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration.
Rogers has served Kentuckys 5th Congressional District since 1981. With a focus on economic development, job creation, fighting illegal drugs and preserving Appalachias natural treasures, he has a reputation for listening to his constituents and fighting for the region he represents.
