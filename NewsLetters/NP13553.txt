Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It was another busy week in Washington! Thank you for the opportunity
to update you on my work for the Sixth Congressional District!
Fighting for Kentucky's Volunteer Firefighters and EMTs
After hearing from folks across the Sixth District about their concerns
and sending a letter to IRS Acting Commissioner Werfel
seeking clarification about how Obamacare treats
volunteer firefighters under the employer mandate, on Wednesday, I
helped introduce H.R. 3685, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and
Emergency Responders Act
.
Unfortunately, the more we learn about Obamacare, the more
disappointing it becomes. I am disappointed that President Obama's
healthcare law is not only wreaking havoc on American families, small
businesses and our economy, but now could be endangering our
communities that rely on emergency response services provided by
volunteer firefighters and EMTs.
Forcing volunteer fire companies to comply with the employer mandate
will potentially lead to the closure of firehouses and layoff of
volunteer firefighters as the fire companies try to avoid
classification as a large employer.
And considering that over 90 percent of fire departments in Kentucky
are either fully or mostly volunteer, this has serious implications for
the safety of communities throughout our Commonwealth. We must do
everything we can to ensure that our brave and selfless volunteer
firefighters and the communities they serve do not become the next
victims of Obamacare's costly mandates.

Reforming Washington
The budget agreement approved by the House of Representatives this week
honors the principles I pledged to support when I came to Washington:
It reduces the deficit and reforms unsustainable spending programs
without raising taxes.
Unlike the deal to raise the debt ceiling in October, which was
produced in the absence any meaningful bipartisan cooperation and
without any substantive fiscal reforms, today's agreement was produced
through a real and deliberative process that will result in modest
reforms representing an important step in the right direction.
This agreement sets the very important precedent of trading short-term,
temporary sequester relief for long-term, permanent reform of mandatory
spending, which is the true driver of our long term debt.
Perhaps most importantly, this agreement does not ask more of
hardworking taxpayers and removes the threat of another government
shutdown.
Kentuckians in the Capitol
On Wednesday, I had the honor of meeting Frankfort resident Ms. Sigga
M. Jagne
, who shared her inspirational
story of fleeing persecution in Gambia, West Africa with her family to
the United States during a very violent military coup d'etat. She was
only 18 at the time, and since then, she has earned a MPA degree at
Kentucky State University and then earned her graduate degree from the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She currently works as the Chief
Executive Officer/Chairwoman at Signara Global Solutions Kentucky
office, and her brother who entered into the U.S. with her is currently
serving as a U.S. Army Captain.
On Thursday, it was great to meet Philippine Ambassador Jose L. Cuisia,
Jr.
. We discussed
potential trade opportunities and I shared info on Kentucky's signature
bourbon, horse and coal industries.
On Friday, I ran into Lafayette High School at Union Station before
their holiday tournament in Washington, DC! Great group of young men!
Creating a Fair Playing Field for Kentucky Businesses
Earlier this year, I learned that a pending decision by the Small
Business Administration (SBA) may eliminate a provision in federal
regulations that are designed to support American manufacturing. There
had been a waiver in place that allowed foreign roller bearings to be
imported, repackaged and sold as "American" products to the Department
of Defense.
I wrote to the SBA on behalf of American manufacturers asking that they
rescind the waiver. We are happy to have a positive resolution that
recognizes the ability of American manufacturers to produce and supply
aerospace roller bearings to the Department of Defense.
This week, it was a pleasure to meet with Lexington-based Taper-Roller
Bearings about this issue. They presented me with an example of one of
these important American-made products produced right here in central
Kentucky.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and also I hope you will forward my weekly
newsletter to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website

home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!
