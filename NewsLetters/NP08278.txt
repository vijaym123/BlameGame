15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
My office will host a
Veterans Intake Day Wednesday, July 2, 2014 . This day will serve as an opportunity for Veterans across
Floridas 15th Congressional District , which includes parts of Hillsborough and Polk Counties, to
share their VA experiences with members of my staff .
Veterans have sacrificed so much for our nation. They deserve a VA that works well and provides them with access to timely quality care. This day will help us know what is working well and what can be improved. We all want our Veterans to receive the best care possible, and working together we can make that happen.
In addition to members of my staff,
representatives from the Hillsborough County Veteran Services, Polk County Veteran Services, Florida Department of Veterans Affairs, and James A. Haley VA Hospital will be in attendance to help answer questions .
Details :
Wednesday, July 2
11:00 a.m.
2:00 p.m.
Temple Terrace City Hall
11250 N. 56th Street
Temple Terrace, FL 33617
As always, please continue to
write ,

your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
