Lipinski Works Across the Aisle
to End Government
Shutdown
Rep. Lipinski is
interviewed by CBS Chicago on the
agreement to reopen the federal
government
During the 16 days
the federal government was shut down in October, Congressman Lipinski
continued to do his job and didnt get caught up in the blame game
and finger pointing. On the day the shutdown took effect, he started
meeting daily with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House
determined to find a way out of the mess as quickly as possible. From the
outset, the group put aside partisan gamesmanship and focused on doing what
was right for the country. Since the effort upset Washingtons we
win, you lose mentality, the group faced a lot of pressure to stop. But
they never quit. To read more about the congressmans efforts to get
the government reopened and the country on the path to long-term
fiscal sustainability, you can read his Southwest News-Herald column
HERE.
I am hopeful that the
spirit of bipartisanship I worked to cultivate will lead to more
solutions. I have already spoken to my colleagues about continuing the
bipartisan discussions we began during this crisis so that we can work
together to find permanent solutions to these issues. No matter
what, I will continue to bravely stand up to work for a Washington that is
focused on solving problems and seeking more wins for the American
people.
Lipinski Joins Local Manufacturer to Announce Start of Work on $925M
Military Contract and Introduces Bill to Strengthen Buy American
Laws to Create More Manufacturing Jobs
A longtime champion of strengthening Buy American
laws, Congressman Lipinski joined Bedford Parks Hoist Liftruck to
announce that the company is beginning work on a $925 million U.S.
Defense Department contract that will create hundreds of good-paying,
middle-class jobs in the area. The contract, which calls for supplying the
military with high-capacity forklifts and container handlers over the
next five years, is expected to roughly double the companys workforce
of about 300 employees. The congressman also has introduced the Buy
American Improvement Act to close loopholes in existing laws and make
sure tax dollars employ American workers, such as those at Hoist. Back
in 2011, Rep. Lipinski successfully intervened on the companys behalf
when a $670,000 federal contract for four forklifts was improperly
awarded to a South Korean company in violation of Buy American
provisions. Read more about this important announcement and the congressmans
bill by reading this Southwest News-Herald story
HERE .
Hoists selection for
this contract is another reminder of the great products that are being
made locally and the tremendous potential for creating jobs in our
communities. That is why we must strengthen Buy American laws and close the
loopholes that allow our tax dollars to employ foreign workers rather
than Americans. My Buy American Improvement Act will ensure that the
federal government is supporting American workers and buying products
stamped Made in
U.S.A.
Lipinski Introduces Bill to Provide Adequate Time to Sign Up for
Health Insurance and Avoid Penalty Under
Obamacare
Concerned about the
ongoing technical difficulties and malfunctions with
healthcare.gov , the Affordable Care Acts federal marketplace website,
Congressman Lipinski has introduced the Health Care Access Fairness and
Penalty Delay Act. This legislation would require the Inspector General that
oversees the Department of Health and Human Services to certify when
the website is fully operational. Once the website is certified to be
working, individuals would have at least 90 days to enroll in a health
care plan. The individual mandates penalties that are part of
Obamacare would not commence until 30 days later. For more on the
congressmans bill, read the Crains Chicago Business story
HERE .
I and many of my constituents have been
frustrated in our efforts to use healthcare.gov to shop for health insurance
and to enroll in a new plan as required for those without insurance by
the Affordable Care Act. I did not vote for the Affordable Care Act but
it is now the law and we need to do everything we can to try to make
it work. Our performance-based proposal would base any delay in the
individual mandate on the time it takes for healthcare.gov to become
fully operational. Only at that point will people be able to effectively
use the website to find health insurance, and it is only fair that we
provide reasonable time and opportunity for individuals to do
so.
