Dear
Friend,
Deep in the thick woods
beyond the Appalachian Mountains, on land claimed by both
Pennsylvania and Virginia, Oliver Miller along with his young family began a new
life as a frontiersman and farmer.
From 1772 until 1927, five generations of Millers resided on a
tract now part of South Park. You can still visit the stone house and
log cabin where guided tours are provided. This past Sunday, I visited
the Oliver Miller Homestead for their annual Thanksgiving feast and
reenactment of an 18 th
century frontier worship
service.
Although Thanksgiving would not
become an official federal holiday until 1863, the singularly American
tradition of celebrating an annual fall harvest and thanking God for
our blessings took root in Scots-Irish homesteads across Southwestern
Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary War. Several of Oliver Millers
sons would fight for our freedom, and later, against unfair taxation
in the Whiskey Rebellion.
In
1778, the outlook for the colonies had finally begun to improve after a
major victory at Saratoga in October. Congress would recognize the
good news by asking a committee of three, which included Sam Adams and
Daniel Roberdeau of Pennsylvania, to draft a report and resolution. The
report declared Thursday, December 18th, as a day of Thanksgiving
to God, so that with one heart and one voice the good people may
express the grateful feelings of their hearts, and consecrate themselves to
the service of their divine
benefactor.
Tomorrow, when you and your family give thanks for the
blessings received in 2014, may you also take a moment to remember those
early settlers
fortified by a faith in Providence
who helped to
make Southwestern Pennsylvania safe and a land of opportunity for
future generations.
Sincerely,
Tim Murphy
Member of
Congress
