ICYMI: Is
America in retreat
Earlier this week,
The Record
ran my op-ed about the many failures of
President Obamas foreign policy.
I sent it out on Wednesday as a
stand-alone piece, but in case you missed it, heres a link to my
article .
Terrorist Armies
Overrunning Iraq; Are We Losing the War on
Terror?
As Daniel Henninger
points out
in the
Wall Street Journal , the inability of the
Iraqi Army to defeat the terrorist insurgents who are undoing everything
that the United States was able to accomplish in Iraq was entirely
predictable.
It is exactly what happens when an American president
bases his foreign policy and military strategy on political expediency
rather than listening to the diplomats and military commanders on the
ground.
Remember the Marines who took Fallujah at
great cost of so many lives and the soldiers that fought in Anbar
Province (which has been held by Al Qaeda for the past six months)?
Now
the terrorists have taken Mosul and Tikrit, bringing them as close to
Baghdad as Philadelphia is to Washington, D.C.
Hundreds of
thousands of refugees are fleeing the terrorist surge, creating what will
become another tragic humanitarian
crisis.
Foreign Policy
magazine has one of the most
comprehensive
analyses
of worldwide terrorist
threats available to the public.
You have to register for limited
access to the site, but its well worth doing.
Sluggish
Economic Recovery Hits Young People Especially
Hard
In this insightful
Wall Street
Journal
article , Andrew Puzder examines why the
worst economic recovery since the Great Depression is hitting young
people especially hard.
He reports that In February the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded the lowest percentage of 16- to
19-year-olds working or actively looking for work (32.9%) since the
bureau started tracking the data in 1948.
The numbers since then
have improved only slightly.
The House has passed 40 bills
designed to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
The Senate
has yet to act on any of them.
What will it take for the Senate
Majority Leader to finally move these bills to the Senate floor for
consideration
another recession?
Former
Vietnam POW, Congressman Sam Johnson, Slams Bergdahl
Deal
My colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson from Texas, spent almost seven
years under brutal and inhumane conditions as a POW in North
Vietnam.
In this impassioned
letter
he lays out
why he thinks it was a mistake to release five senior Taliban leaders to
achieve the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
VA
Healthcare System Failure is Widespread
This
Wall Street Journal
editorial
clearly defines the widespread nature of the failures of the
Department of Veterans Affairs health care system.
The situation is
simply unacceptable and the Presidents failure to appointment a new
head of the VA is baffling.
He needs to nominate someone with
the skills and abilities to manage the system and set it right.
Our veterans deserve nothing less.
New Jerseys Role
in the Constitutional Convention of 1787
I was
honored to be asked by the official website of the NJ 350 th
Anniversary Celebration to contribute a blog recalling New Jerseys key
role in breaking the gridlock that threatened to scuttle the
Constitutional Convention in 1787.
Our states leadership at that crucial
hour is one of the highlights of New Jerseys history, and in the
history of the United States.
You can read my blog post
here .
Salute: New Jerseys
Fallen Honored at Picatinny
I was honored to
participate
in a moving ceremony at Picatinny Arsenal
this past Sunday honoring the three New Jerseyans who lost their lives
in the service of our country in 2013: Sgt. Derek McConnell of North
Caldwell; Staff Sgt. Eric D. Christian, of Ramsey; and, Staff Sgt.
Timothy R. McGill of Ramsey.
Three red oak trees
New Jerseys
state tree
were planted as an enduring memorial to each of these
brave men who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our liberty and
way of life.
Salute: Liz Parker of the New Jersey
Hills Media Group
Congratulations to Liz Parker,
co-publisher and executive editor of the New Jersey Hills Media Group,
for being named this years recipient of the Emma C. McKinney Award,
given by the National Newspaper Association.
Liz is being
recognized for her many years of leadership to the community through the
community press.
Several of the NJ Hills Medias Groups 15 local
papers cover much of the 11 th
Congressional District.
Best wishes to Liz on this well-deserved
honor .
Salute: LTC Jason Mackay, Picatinny Arsenal Garrison
Commander
LTC Jason Mackay, Garrison Commander at
Picatinny Arsenal, is wrapping up his tour of duty there.
Over the past two years as Garrison Commander, he contributed much to
ensure that Picatinny remains a world-class facility for developing
the weaponry that gives our troops the winning edge on the field of
battle.
Theres no doubt that his previous service overseas,
especially in both Iraq and Afghanistan, made LTC Mackay acutely aware
of the importance of the work done at Picatinny.
I have been
grateful for his partnership with me in our shared mission of ensuring
that Picatinny has the resources it needs to continue to carry out its
vitally important mission.
Salute: Happy
90 th
President George H.W. Bush
President George
H.W. Bush celebrated his 90 th
birthday on June
12 th
by making a parachute jump from 6,000 feet above his home in
Kennebunkport, Maine!
This was the 41 st
presidents eighth
parachute jump.
The first was during World War II, when his
fighter plane was shot down on a mission in the Pacific.
Happy
birthday, Mr. President!
You can watch his jump
here .
Salute: Dr. Henry Kissinger Turns
91
Former Secretary of State and one-time National
Security Advisor Henry Kissinger recently celebrated his 91 st
birthday.
Senator John McCain, recalling his captivity as a POW in
North Vietnam,
offered
this moving toast to Dr.
Kissinger at a party in his honor last week.
