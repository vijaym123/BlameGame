This winter, many Minnesotans who rely on propane to heat their homes have felt the pain of a reduced propane supply, leading to higher energy prices. If the Keystone XL pipeline was already built rail capacity currently used for transporting oil could be used to transport propane instead providing relief for many Minnesotans this winter. Please take a moment to
