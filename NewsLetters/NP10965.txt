Dear Friend,
I would like to invite you to join me for a unique event to work to
improve the country's fiscal health. I will be conducting a Principles
and Priorities budget exercise in conjunction with the Concord
Coalition, where we will collaborate to tackle our nation's budget
issues.
You will get to sit down with a diverse group of people from our
community and explore some of your own solutions and ideas for meeting
our fiscal challenges. You will face the same challenges and
limitations Congress works with when we tackle the budget, and in the
end, you will share your budget recommendations with me to take back to
my colleagues in Washington.
If you share my concerns about our nation's budget issues, this event
will give us the chance to work together to see how we can solve them.
This exercise will allow you to gain a better understanding of the
budget issues facing Congress, and I hope we can all gain a better
understanding of the challenges we face and the solutions we need.
The workshop will be held Saturday, April 5, at Columbine High School -
Commons, located at 6201 S Pierce St, Littleton, CO 80123, from 9-11 AM.
The Concord Coalition is a non-partisan civic organization dedicated to
educating the public about the causes and consequences of federal
budget deficits and the long-term challenges facing America's budget
picture. They use their findings from events like these when they
testify before Congress -- and your participation can help shape their
reports.
This event is free and open to the public, but seating is limited to
the first 150 people of the First Congressional District who RSVP.
Please RSVP to my office at DeGette.RSVP@mail.house.gov or call
303-844-4988 by April 4, 2014.
Sincerely,
Diana DeGette
Member of Congress
