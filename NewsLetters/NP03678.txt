Happy New Year!
I hope you had a blessed
holiday season and are looking forward to 2015.
Before we enjoy
a day full of football and a feast of greens and black-eyed-peas, I
would like to take a moment to reflect on 2014.
Serving you and your family is truly an honor, and I am humbled to be your
voice in Congress.
Thank you for your input and reaching out to
our offices for assistance.
Last year, my staff and I replied to
10,171 letters concerning federal agencies, federal issues, and
upcoming legislation.
At the same time, we helped 1,529 constituents
resolve their individual cases with federal agencies like the
Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, and Department
of Homeland Security.
When casting a vote,
introducing legislation, or co-sponsoring bills, I rely on your opinions,
comments, letters, phone calls, and emails for guidance.
Please
continue to contact
me , or any member of my staff, to express your opinions and
share suggestions on ways we can make life better and doing business
easier in South Carolinas Seventh District.
I am proud
of the progress we have made in our community and hope to build on
these accomplishments in 2015.
Last year, our Seventh
District Economic Developer Rodney Berry worked to bring much-needed
job opportunities to counties like Chesterfield, Dillon, and Marion.
Our offices worked with the Federal Communications Commission to
expand local TV broadcast coverage in Georgetown and Chesterfield
counties so residents can view their local news.
I worked diligently
with my colleagues to ensure emerging ports like Georgetown are
eligible for federal funding in the recently enacted Water Resources Bill;
after multiple meetings with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of
Georgetown is finally receiving the attention it deserves.
I have
worked with the South Carolina Department of Transportation, the
Federal Highway Administration, and the US Army Corps of Engineers to make
progress on the Interstate 73 project and permitting process.
We
are hopeful the state will receive its permit
soon.
In Congress, I worked with my colleagues to bring more attention to
the regulatory issues impacting small businesses and our countrys
ability to compete internationally.
Harvard Business School Professor
Michael Porter and I drafted an American Competitiveness Resolution,
which outlines
a plan to make our country
competitive
again.
As Chairman of a House Small
Business Subcommittee, I held hearings that focused on issues affecting
small businesses like tax complexity and regulatory reform.
To
highlight the importance of mid-sized businesses, I launched the
bipartisan Middle Market Growth Caucus with three of my colleagues.
Additionally, several pieces of legislation I introduced achieved results
or were enacted.
The STOP Resolution sparked the movement to
rein in executive
overreach
and resulted in the House of Representatives taking legal action to
protect our Constitution.
Also, a bill I introduced to correct a
mapping error that has impacted a part of our community for years was
signed into law by the President on December 18.
On
Tuesday, the 114th Congress is sworn in and a new session of Congress
begins.
I look forward to working with my colleagues to address
some of our countrys biggest challenges.
Please take a moment to
complete the poll below about the issues you would like Congress to
tackle first.
Thank you again for a wonderful 2014 and
the opportunity to serve you and your family.
I hope 2015 brings
you exciting opportunities, good fortune, and
peace.
Cheers!
