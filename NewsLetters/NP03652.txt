Kansas Common Sense
December 29, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." I hope you and your family are
enjoying this holiday season. Robba and I enjoyed a peaceful Christmas
with our family and we wish you and yours a very Happy New Year. In
January, Capitol Hill begins to forge a new path and I am hopeful 2015
will bring a Congress better capable of working together for the
well-being of our nation. I look forward to advocating for pro-growth
policies that create jobs and more economic opportunity for every
American.
On Friday, I spoke with Kelly Lenz on the Kansas Ag Network to discuss
trade with Cuba, my new committee assignments for the 114th Congress
and the Farm Bill. Click here

Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
Kansas Listening Tour Continues
This week, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with four stops in
Harper, Barber, Edwards, and Stafford Counties. The issues I focus on
and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely based on the
conversations I have with Kansans so making certain I am home to visit
with folks is my top priority. I was proud to learn this week that I
led my Senate colleagues in hosting the most town hall meetings in 2014
with 80 Listening Tour Stops throughout Kansas. You can visit my
website
for upcoming
Kansas Listening Tour stops in your community.
On Monday, about 15 residents in Harper County joined me at Chaparral
High School in Anthony to share feedback on a number of issues facing
our country. Topics of discussion included rural access to health care,
getting veterans the health care they need, the farm bill and
regulatory issues related to agriculture and the oil & gas industry.
Thanks again to all those who took the time to share their thoughts and
concerns with me, and thank you to Dana Craig for helping to organize
my visit.
>From Harper County, I headed to Medicine Lodge in Barber County where I
visited with folks at People's Bank, including Dennis Ricke, Barber
County Farm Bureau President, who discussed the Lesser Prairie Chicken.
While in Medicine Lodge, I also had the opportunity to visit Medicine
Lodge Memorial Hospital and Physician's Clinic where I met with CFO Tom
Lee and his wife Suzanne Lee, Executive Director of the Medicine Lodge
Community Health Foundation, and received a tour of the hospital.
Medicine Lodge Memorial Hospital recently completed Phase 2 of its
renovations and I was very impressed with the new facility. Finally, I
visited with Sloane Freeman at the pharmacy in Medicine Lodge and saw
their newly renovated drug store in an old grocery store. In addition
to providing patients with advice and filling prescriptions, locals
like to come in and grab coffee at the pharmacy. The Freeman's truly
provide a great service to the community.
My third Listening Tour stop this week was in Edwards County where I
held a town hall meeting at St. Bernard Parish Hall in Belpre. The
folks in attendance were interested in discussing a range of topics
including changes to U.S. relations with Cuba, the importance of
approving the Keystone XL pipeline in the next Congress, the sanctity
of life, immigration, and tax reform. The community expressed thanks
for the efforts to protect local Post Offices. I appreciated their kind
words. Thanks again to former County Commissioner Marge Scheufler for
helping organize my visit and to all who shared their thoughts and
concerns.
My final stop Monday was in Stafford County at the Courthouse Annex in
St. John. Topics of discussion ranged from concerns with Obamacare and
access to rural health care, to the Marketplace Fairness Act and the
importance of agriculture and water to our state. Thanks again to the
concerned citizens who attended. And thank you to the Stafford County
Kansas Farm Bureau for hosting and Sharilyn McNickle for helping to
organize.
I appreciate these opportunities to hear from Kansans. I have upcoming
Listening Tour stops next Monday in Burdett at the Burdett Senior
Center, in Jetmore at King Center, and in Ness City at the Ness County
Courthouse. On Wednesday, I will be at the Community Building in
Fairview. Friday I will be hosting town halls at the Scott County
Hospital meeting room and then in the community room of the Lane County
Courthouse. On Tuesday Jan. 6th I will be in Lenexa hosting a town hall
at the Fire Station #3 auditorium.
You can find out more about these town hall meetings in the sidebar of
this newsletter. As I continue to schedule Listening Tour stops, I look
forward to hearing from folks across the state.
Thanks to Fall/Winter 2014 Interns
My own interest in public service was sparked by an internship for
Kansas First District Congressman Keith Sebelius in 1974. As an intern,
I had the chance to learn firsthand how a Congressional office operates
and how the legislative process works.
I am proud to be able to offer this same opportunity in my Senate
office today where I have interns year-round who have a unique
opportunity to work closely with my staff on behalf of Kansas. Thanks
to the fall/winter 2015 interns - Nathan Yunker of Hays, Fort Hays
State University; and Jakob Provo of El Dorado, Kansas Wesleyan
University - for all of your hard work. I wish you the best of luck as
you pursue your dreams and begin your careers.
Applications
are already being accepted for
internships in my Washington, D.C., office for the summer 2015 term.
Congressional internships are open to qualified undergraduate and
graduate students who have an interest in public service and have
achieved academic excellence.
Honored to Serve You in Washington
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by
email by clicking here
. You can also click here
to contact me through one of my
Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C., office.
Very truly yours,
Jerry

Kansas
Listening
Tour
Continues
This
week,
I
continued
my
Kansas
Listening
Tour
with
four
stops
in
Harper,
Barber,
Edwards,
and
Stafford
Counties.
The
issues
I
focus
on
and
work
I
do
in
Washington,
D.C.,
are
largely
based
on
the
conversations
I
have
with
Kansans
so
making
certain
I
am
home
to
visit
with
folks
is
my
top
priority.
I
was
proud
to
learn
this
week
that
I
led
my
Senate
colleagues
in
hosting
the
most
town
hall
meetings
in
2014
with
80
Listening
Tour
Stops
throughout
Kansas.
You
can
visit
my
website
for
upcoming
Kansas
Listening
Tour
stops
in
your
community.
On
Monday,
about
15
residents
in
Harper
County
joined
me
at
Chaparral
High
School
in
Anthony
to
share
feedback
on
a
number
of
issues
facing
our
country.
Topics
of
discussion
included
rural
access
to
health
care,
getting
veterans
the
health
care
they
need,
the
farm
bill
and
regulatory
issues
related
to
agriculture
and
the
oil
&amp;
gas
industry.
Thanks

to
all
those
who
took
the
time
to
share
their
thoughts
and
concerns
with
me,
and
thank
you
to
Dana
Craig
for
helping
to
organize
my
visit.
From
Harper

I
headed
to

Lodge
in
Barber
County
where
I
visited
with
folks
at
People's
Bank,
including
Dennis
Ricke,
Barber
County
Farm
Bureau
President,
who
discussed
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken.
While
in
Medicine
Lodge,
I
also
had
the

Memorial
Hospital
and
Physician's
Clinic
where
I
met

Tom
Lee
and
his

Community
Health
Foundation,
and
received
a

Lodge
Memorial
Hospital
recently
completed
Phase
2
of
its
renovations
and
I
was
very
impressed
with
the
new
facility.
Finally,
I
visited
with
Sloane
Freeman
at
the
pharmacy
in
Medicine
Lodge
and
saw
their
newly
renovated
drug
store
in
an
old
grocery
store.
In
addition
to
providing
patients
with
advice
and
filling
prescriptions,
locals
like
to
come
in
and
grab
coffee
at
the
pharmacy.
The

truly
provide
a
great
service
to
the
community.
My
third
Listening

this
week
was
in
Edwards
County
where
I
held
a
town
hall
meeting
at
St.
Bernard
Parish
Hall
in
Belpre.
The
folks
in
attendance
were
interested
in
discussing
a
range

U.S.
relations
with Cuba,
the
importance
of
approving
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
in
the
next
Congress,
the
sanctity
of
life,
immigration,
and
tax
reform.
The

the
efforts
to
protect
local
Post
Offices.
I
appreciated
their
kind
words.
Thanks
again
to
former

health
care,

Fairness
Act
and
the

Thanks
to
Fall/Winter
2014
Interns
My
own
interest
in
public
service
was
sparked
by
an
internship
for
Kansas
First
District
Congressman
Keith
Sebelius
in
1974.
As
an
intern,
I
had
the
chance
to
learn
firsthand
how
a
Congressional
office
operates
and
how
the
legislative
process
works.
I
am
proud
to
be
able
to
offer
this
same
opportunity
in
my
Senate
office
today
where
I
have
interns
year-round
who
have
a
unique
opportunity
to
work
closely
with
my
staff
on
behalf
of
Kansas.

all
of
your
