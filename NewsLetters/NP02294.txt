County Rights and Wyomings Expertise CORRECTION
Dear Friends,
Last week at a Natural Resources Committee hearing I spoke with Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell about a new BLM planning process called Planning 2.0.
CORRECTION Wyomings county commissioners had previously been informed of the new Planning 2.0 process, but have concerns about the process that have not yet been fully addressed. END CORRECTION
It is crucial that county commissioners be informed of all new procedures and processes since it is their job and their statutory right to represent local interests in federal land management decisions within their respective counties.
Our county commissioners understand their rights in federal planning processes.
They know their rights so well that federal employees are flown out to Wyoming to be educated on county rights as applied to federal rules and management policies.
This is just one part of Wyomings expertise in countys rights.
Please let me know your
thoughts and concerns
on these and other issues.
Sincerely,
