Dear Friends,
In a transparent attempt to calm panicky
Congressional Democrats, this week the Administration rushed to
declare the disastrous Obamacare website fixed. Despite the "mission
accomplished" spin, experts are warning that the site is still a hacker's
dream , the system for
processing payments is
not
built , and the subsidies available on healthcare.gov are an open
invitation to
fraud .
Even if the website was working
perfectly, Obamacare would still be a train wreck. For many Americans,
costs are
soaring ,
plans are being
cancelled ,
and longstanding doctor-patient relationships are being
severed .
There is a better way. H.R. 2300, the Empower
Patients First Act, of which I am a cosponsor, would lower costs and
save taxpayers $2.34 trillion
over its first 10 years. It would do so by repealing Obamacare and
replacing it with patient centered solutions, including the ability to
purchase insurance across state lines, health savings accounts, and
expanded tax credits for purchasing health insurance.
H.R. 2300 would also guarantee access for
those with pre-existing conditions and crack down on frivolous
lawsuits that drive up the cost of providing health
care.
The President may want to declare the
Obamacare fiasco solved and move on, but until we achieve quality health
care reform, the mission will not be accomplished.
Stay in touch
and God bless,
