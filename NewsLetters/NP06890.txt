---------- Original Email ----------
HOLY COW!!!
Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi issued an
inspiring
call-to-action to Illinois Democrats. And your response has been nothing short of SENSATIONAL!!! 841 people and counting
have stepped up for Brad -- that&rsquo;s JUST IN THE LAST 24 HOURS!!!
If we can hit
1,000 online donors
by midnight, it&rsquo;ll send a
LOUD
and
CLEAR
message to Karl Rove and all the others trying to tear down Brad's record. According to our records, it looks like you haven't had a chance to pitch in to Nancy's call-to-action. Don't worry David -- there's still time!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Team Brad
