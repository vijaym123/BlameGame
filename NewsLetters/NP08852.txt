7th DISTRICT
June 10, 2014
Dear
Friends:
In response to the recent revelations regarding the VAs
care for our veterans, the House unanimously passed the Veteran Access to
Care Act of 2014, of which I am an original
cosponsor.
This important measure will help ensure that
our veterans receive prompt and quality care by allowing them access to
non-VA medical facilities and treatment. The bill also establishes an
independent assessment of VAs health administration and
performance.
This is an important first step
to gain back the trust of our veterans and to correct problems with the
current system.
Most
respectfully,
John L.
Mica
Member of Congress
