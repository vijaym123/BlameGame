Friend,
Over the last 6 months, Ami has been working his hardest to put people above politics and move our country forward.
But right now, he needs help.
6 months into the election cycle is when challengers begin to size up the competition and explore whether they will run.
And the June 30 th
FEC deadline serves as an indicator that will either encourage or discourage self-funding challengers depending on how well we do.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important that we hit our $10,000 goal before the June 30 th
FEC deadline.
In addition, a group of supporters have stepped up and will match all contributions up to $10,000 before our June 30 th
deadline.
Will you chip in $5 or more to help us hit our $10,000 goal and have your contribution doubled?
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate: $5
Donate: $25
Donate: $50

Last year, our self-funding opponent dumped more than $4 million of his own money into the race and we would like to avoid a similar situation this election.
The strength we show now will discourage self-funders from jumping into the race and helps build the foundation for a winning campaign,
but we need everyone to step up before our June 30 th
FEC deadline .
Every dollar makes a huge difference&mdash; click here to chip in $5 or more and have your contribution doubled.
Thanks again,
Team Bera
