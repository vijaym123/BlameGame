2015 STATE OF THE DISTRICT ADDRESS
Dear Neighbor,
I write to invite you to my State of the District address to be held on Thursday, January 29 at Long Island University in Brooklyn.
During the speech, I will discuss the progress we have made in our community over the last year and outline issues related to jobs, the police-community relationship and affordable housing.
The event will also feature musical and artistic performances from local residents. A reception will be held upon conclusion of the speech.
Best,
Hakeem Jeffries
Member of Congress (NY-8)
