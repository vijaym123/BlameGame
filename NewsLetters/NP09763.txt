Dear David,
Last week was a
tremendous week in Washington. Great strides were made in
holding Washington accountable and to bring transparency back to America.
I am certain this momentum, that I am proud to be a part of, will
continue.
House Acts to Deliver Accountability
The house passed
three momentous resolutions that will hold accountable the Obama
administration for recent actions, for which Americans continue to seek
answers: the attack on the UN consulate at Beghazi, Libya and the IRS
scandal.
H.Res. 574 holds former Internal Revenue Service
official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer
questions about her agency's targeting of conservative tax-exempt
applicants. This passed 231-187. I also voted for H.Res. 565, which passed
250-168, to call on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint special counsel
to investigate the targeting of these conservative groups by the
IRS.
Thursday, we voted to pass H.Res. 567, which passed
232-186, to form a select committee to investigate the tragedy of the attack
on the consulate in Benghazi that resulted in the death of four
Americans.
The Obama administrations needs to be held
accountable for breaking the fundamental trust of the American people. These
three resolutions will finally begin to hold the administration
accountable, and provide the answers that Americans deserve.
It's Time to Extend
Maternity Leave for Women in the Military
On Friday, I was
proud to see that a bill I originally co-sponsored was introduced. The
Military Opportunities for Mothers (MOM) Act will extend maternity
leave for women serving in the military from six to 12 weeks. The
legislation will align access to maternity leave for female service members
with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guidelines available to federal
employees.
As we celebrated Mother's Day this past
weekend, many women in uniform were deployed around the world, serving at
duty posts and in combat positions throughout our military. Mothers in
the military make sacrifices every day for our freedom. Extending
maternity leave for these women is the least we can do for those who fight
for our country.
Charter Schools Provide
Opportunities, School Choice for Thousands of New Mexico Families
On
Thursday, I voted in favor of H.R. 10, the Opportunity Through Quality
Charter Schools Act, a bill to reauthorize and modernize the
charter schools program that has provided millions of American families,
and 20,000 New Mexican children, with choice in quality educational
opportunities.
The bipartisan bill provides incentives for
the creation and expansion of quality charter schools. Charter schools
provide opportunities and school choice for thousands of New Mexico
families. H.R. 10, which passed 360-45, increases flexibility for the use
of federal grants to be used to expand and improve existing charter
schools, and creates new high-quality charter schools. The legislation
also increases authorized funds eligible for federal charter school
grants from $250 million a year to $300 million.
I recently
visited La Academia Delores Huerta and New Americas schools, two
charter schools in Las Cruces, where I gained first-hand insight into the
successful outcomes of charter schools. New Mexico has 98 charter
schools that currently serve 20,000 students.
Supreme
Court Rules in Favor of Prayer
I would also like to applaud
the Supreme Court's decision last week in favor of the Town of Greece
in the case of Town of Greece v. Galloway. This decision found that an
opening prayer is a longstanding tradition performed in local
municipalities and in the United States Congress. This ceremonial practice is
a constitutional right for all governing bodies.
In August
2013, I joined with 84 other Members of Congress who submitted an
Amicus Brief in support of the Town of Greece. This brief sought to
restore the use of the Coercion Test, a standard by which the Supreme Court
tests constitutionality. I believe the Supreme Court made the correct
decision in upholding the right of any city or government, no matter
the size, to recite a prayer.
Veterans Town Hall in Las Cruces
Veterans are
encouraged to attend a town hall I will host Wednesday, May 14, at the
Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum, 4100 Dripping Springs Road, in Las
Cruces. I will lead the meeting, joined by members of my veterans
advisory council, and representatives of the El Paso Veterans' Affairs
Medical Center. Call 575-522-0771 for more information.
