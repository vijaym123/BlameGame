Vern
Buchanan pushes fed mental health
overhaul

SARASOTA
Beginning in the late 1950s, America's state mental
hospitals closed as taxpayers embraced the idea new drug treatments and
safe houses to mainstream the ill had made them
obsolete.
But as Reps. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and Tim Murphy, R-Pa., told a
crowd of 150 at a Sarasota Town Hall meeting Tuesday, those decisions
proved
disastrous.
"I don't know if he is alive or
dead," Carol Rosenbaum of Sarasota said of her mentally ill 39-year-old
son, Mark, who is now in Sarasota's Bayside Center for Behavioral Health
but is often homeless on the streets of Sarasota, unable to handle
normal life situations and
routines.
"I fantasize about
being able to just scoop him up and put him in a place with 10 or 20
acres and a big fence," Rosenbaum
said.
Rosenbaum cried
as she told Murphy and Buchanan her bipolar son began exhibiting
symptoms at age 19. People on the street steal his phone and bike, she said.
It's hard to know where he belongs because he is not easy to
handle.
"He is exploited," she
said.
The hardest thing for her, she said, is her son
sometimes won't let her participate in his mental health care and she has
no choice but to
comply.
Because of court rulings,
patients are often not required to take their medications in safe houses
and families are not always able to intervene on their behalf or even
allowed information, Murphy
said.
As a result, America's
jails and homeless shelters, including those of Sarasota and
Bradenton, have become home to many mentally ill patients, Murphy
added.
"I think mental health is now a national crisis," Murphy told
Rosenbaum, mentioning the 600,000 inpatient psychiatric beds for the
mentally ill 70 years ago in state mental hospitals have dwindled to
40,000
today.
Murphy and Buchanan said they came to the
Sainer Pavilion on the campus of New College to propose a new
idea.
He and Buchanan are sponsoring, "The Helping Families in
Mental Health Crisis Act," also known as House Resolution 3717, which
the pair say is an overhaul of mental health care in
America.
Buchanan said the bill is not expected to carry any additional
costs because it simply reorganizes how $125 billion in federal mental
health dollars are already being
spent.
The pair said
the bill will fix the shortage of inpatient beds for the most critical
patients.
The bill would also provide
"tele-psychiatry" to link primary care doctors with psychiatrists in rural areas and
increase the number of psychiatrists who treat children, which now
stands at one psychiatrist for every 7,000 children, Murphy
said.
The bill also supports court-ordered assisted outpatient
treatment, which would force states to follow up on mentally ill patients
and not just forget them, a practice Murphy referred to as
"dumping."
Mary Ruiz, president and chief executive officer of
Manatee Glens, Manatee County's behavioral health hospital, said she
supports the proposed
bill.
"We are encouraged by so many key
provisions in HR 3717, which we urge you to protect as the bill moves
through the congressional approval process," Ruiz said. "These issues
touch almost every extended family in
America."
Manatee Glens serves one out of every 30 Manatee County families, Ruiz said,
which shows how invasive mental illness
is.
Ann
Jerman, a Bradenton resident and a member of the National Alliance on Mental
Illness of Manatee and Sarasota, attended a stakeholders meeting
prior to the Town Hall and said it was
eye-opening.
"On one
side of the table sat 10 members of the National Alliance on Mental
Illness of Manatee and Sarasota Counties representing adult mentally
ill family members, and on the other side of the table you saw 10
uniformed police officers from Manatee and Sarasota counties," Jerman
said.
"So, the stakeholders are the family members and the
police officers. This picture tells you that the adult mentally ill are
being cared for by families or they are in jail. The police are being
asked to serve a population that they are not trained to handle. The
jails have become huge state psychiatric
hospitals."
