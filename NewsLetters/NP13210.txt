New Year's Resolutions for Congress
As Americans
are making their New Years resolutions, I think its time that
Congress makes a few New Years resolutions of its own. I spoke on the
House floor last Thursday about the need for Congress to work together
on bipartisan New Year's resolutions:
Congress
will resolve itself to stop asking for money and higher taxes from the
American people to pay for more bureaucracy and more bloated federal
programs.
Congress will actually try to balance its
budget, something the rest of the American people have to
do.
Congress will resolve itself to stop the onslaught of rules,
regulations and mandates on our constituents that slow down the economy and
kill jobs.
Congress will focus more on programs that
create jobs and less on programs that create government
dependency.
Congress will stop allowing the federal government to spy
on and read the private emails of innocent
Americans.
Congress will live under the same laws it passes for everyone else. With
no special health care or retirement benefits.
Lastly,
Congress will resolve itself to spend time more time listening to the
American people and working together, Republicans and Democrats, to
solve the problems that our nation faces.

December Unemployment Report
Concerning
The U.S. Labor Department released the new
unemployment rate and jobs report
data
from December 2013 on Friday morning. The disappointing report
shows U.S. employers added only
74,000 new jobs
during
the last month of the year. Additionally, because many Americans
altogether stopped looking for employment, the national unemployment rate
fell to
6.7 percent . But the labor force participation
rate which shows the proportion of Americans either working or looking
for work also fell to
62.8 percent
an
almost
36-year low .

This isnt the news we wanted to hear
to start the New Year, but these numbers underscore the importance of
our top priority in Congress
helping Americas entrepreneurs and
businesses grow and create jobs. Millions of Americans are out there
wanting to go back to work and earn a paycheck, but the opportunities just
arent there. The House will continue to pass pro-jobs legislation and
bills that will help expand the economy, creating more opportunities
for hard-working Americans to make a living, provide for their
families and save for the future.

Health Exchange
Security and Transparency Act
Last week, the House took
important steps to protect Americans' private and personal information
online by passing
H.R. 3811 -
the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act of
2014 . I voted " Yes " on this bill and it passed by a
bipartisan vote of
291-122 . This common sense legislation
simply requires the Department of Health and Human Services to notify
individuals, within two business days, of any breach of any security
system maintained by a federal or state exchange that is known to have
resulted in personally identifiable information being stolen or
unlawfully accessed.
Americans, for
good reason, are increasingly concerned about their personal information
being viewed or stolen as a result of an internet security breach. As
we've seen recently, private companyies act quickly to let customers
know when their systems are hacked. If millions of Americans are forced
to use specific websites to enroll in health insurance coverage under
the Affordable Care Act, this legislation ensures the federal
government will act quickly to notify them as well.
