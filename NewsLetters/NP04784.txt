Friend -- Nate Silver: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say we wake up on Wednesday morning, and the headline is that Democrats kept the U.S. Senate.&rdquo; Silver reports the GOP would be left in shambles:
They&rsquo;d be questioning the future of the GOP and asking: &ldquo;How damaging is the Republican Party label?&rdquo;
&ldquo;They would have almost no chance of holding the Senate until 2018.&rdquo;
Right now, SIX races are within TWO points. Democrats can take this election from the GOP -- AND permanently damage the Republican Party.
