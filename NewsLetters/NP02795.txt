David -- &ldquo;Irresponsible&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t even begin to cover it. Try &ldquo;grave threat to national safety.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s GOP Speaker Boehner, announcing on
Fox News
that
Republicans will &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; shut down the Department of Homeland Security
if they don&rsquo;t get their way by forcing through an anti-immigrant amendment.
And if they shut it down? More than 240,000 workers would have to stay home or be forced to work without pay.
Our national security could be threatened.
And all because Republicans don&rsquo;t like President Obama&rsquo;s executive actions on immigration and are willing to hold this department hostage to get their way.
Tell John Boehner and Republicans not to shut down Homeland Security! We need 100,000 signatures in the next 24 hours to send a strong message!

Mitch McConnell vowed in November that there would be no more shutdown threats while Republicans controlled Congress. But it didn&rsquo;t take long to break that promise. Now one of our most critical departments is at risk because John Boehner wants to score political points for the Tea Party.
It&rsquo;s absurd -- and it&rsquo;s dangerous. Let&#39;s do everything we can to stop it. Will you join us?
Add your voice: Tell the GOP to fund the Department of Homeland Security and drop the shutdown threats.
