Dear Friend,
The people of Ohios 16
th
District hoped that President
Obama would spend his sixth State of the
Union addressing how he plans to work with
Congress to grow our economy, help
veterans, strengthen our military, increase
our domestic energy supply, and fix his
broken health care law that has increased
costs for families and small businesses.
Instead, we continued to hear more of the
same rhetoric.
Though he pledged to put forth ideas
that will help hardworking Americans, the
substance of the plans he outlined reveal
the opposite. I agree that we need to
reform our broken tax code, increase access
to affordable higher education, and address
cybersecurity. However, higher taxes, more
spending, and increased regulations will
not remedy our countrys problems.
Instead, they will only serve as a
roadblock to job creation and hamper
economic growth.
When he spoke about tax reform, he
announced $320 billion in tax increases.
That is not what real tax reform looks
like. We must provide relief to hardworking
Americans by simplifying our convoluted tax
code, and thats something we need to
work together on to accomplish. As a member
of the Ways &amp; Means Subcommittee with
jurisdiction over taxes, I will continue to
advocate for comprehensive tax reform that
will lower rates for all Americans,
increase our global competitiveness, and
lead to the creation of thousands of jobs.
I urge the president to work with us toward
that goal.
President Obama also outlined a plan to
offer tuition-free community college. What
he didnt mention was how he intends
to pay for it. Under his plan, 529 college
saving funds would be taxed
meaning
hardworking families keep less of the money
theyve put away to send their
children to college. As the first member of
my family to graduate from college and as a
father of three children, I understand the
importance of receiving a college degree
and the opportunities that come with
it.However, President Obamas
plan puts the cost burden on the very
people he is trying to help. That is why
earlier this week, one of my colleagues
reintroduced a bill that would make higher
education more affordable by consolidating
and simplifying four current tax benefits
into a new American Opportunity Tax Credit.
I expect the House to vote on this
legislation and look forward to updating
you on it.
Weve witnessed more than five
years of this administrations failed
policies. The American people have spoken,
and they dont want more bureaucracy,
more regulations, and more debt. They want
a stronger economy, more jobs, less debt,
and more government accountability. They
want more opportunities. They want serious
lawmakers who are willing to work together
to find real solutions.
As the founder of the Bipartisan Working
Group, I am committed to finding common
ground with my friends on both sides of the
aisle in order to make progress. Your
priorities are our priorities, and this new
American Congress is eager to work together
to advance them so that we can pass on a
stronger America to the next
generation.
