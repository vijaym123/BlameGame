You and I both know: Our veterans are the real American idols. Thats why delays in access to care and wait lists are not only a systemic problem nationwide
they are a national disgrace. We cant afford to lose focus on this issue. Heres what Im working on:
If the VA cannot provide timely medical care to our veterans, then we need to get them care at a private doctor. I supported a bill to do just that, which passed unanimously in the House (Read:
H.R. 4810 ).
Holding the Deptartment of Veterans Affairs accountable isnt optional - its essential. I supported a bill to allow any senior bureaucrat at the VA to be fired or demoted for poor performance (Read:
H.R. 4031 ).
Our heroes deserve better than backlogs and bureaucracy. I supported a bill to evaluate the underlying causes of the severe claims backlog that is plaguing the Veterans Benefits Administration and to create commonsense solutions to help reduce or eliminate the backlog (Read:
H.R. 2189 ).
