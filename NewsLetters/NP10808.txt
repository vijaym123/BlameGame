Save American Workers
Act
Passes House
There are currently 7.2 million
Americans working
part-time for economic
reasons.
This number is likely to grow because of the 30-hour rule in
the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
This rule changes the long-standing
definition of a full-time employee from 40 hours a week to 30 hours
for the purpose of the ACAs employer mandate.
Under that
mandate, employers with more than 100 workers who put it at least 30
hours a week will have to provide health insurance starting January 1,
2015.
As a result, many businesses that cannot afford to provide
Obamacare-mandated policies are already cutting the hours of part-time
workers below 30 hours a week. Once the employer mandate goes into
effect, many more part-time workers are likely to suffer loss of income
as their hours are cut.
Yesterday, though, the House took an
important step for undoing the
damage of the
30-hour rule
by passing H.R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which
would repeal the 30-hour rule in Obamacare.
I am an original
cosponsor of the bill.
I urge the Senate to pass this
bill as soon as possible, so we can save the jobs of American workers
from the devastating impact of the 30-hour
rule.
Eliminating the Sequester is a National Security
Necessity
Mackenzie Eaglen, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute,
offers
an incisive analysis of the
threat to our national security if the President wont work with Congress
to ensure that the automatic spending cuts to our national defense
mandated by the sequester arent eliminated.
Obamacare
Report Card
At Best, Incomplete and
Unsubstantiated
This
article
in
The
Hill
suggests that the Presidents victory lap for
Obamacare on April Fools Day might have been premature.
Of particular
interest is how little the Presidents healthcare reform has done to
reduce the ranks of the uninsured.
Afghan Women See
Hope in the Ballot Box
As Afghanistan goes to
the polls tomorrow to vote in that countrys national elections, Afghani
women are playing an important role.
As the
New
York Times
reported
on
Wednesday, There is finally the sense here, after years of international aid
and effort geared toward improving Afghans womens lives, that women
have become a significant part of Afghan political life, if not a
powerful one.
The enormous strides made by women in
Afghanistan over the past decade are among the most tangible benefits of our
engagement in that country.
We all owe a great debt of gratitude
to every American who has served, both in uniform as members of our
Armed Forces and as civilians in our diplomatic corps and in other
international aid agencies of the United States.
New
Jerseys Ukrainian Americans: Heroes Do Not Die
I
have met several times in recent weeks with numerous leaders of the
Ukrainian American community in New Jersey to stand in solidarity with
them in support of freedom and national sovereignty for Ukraine.
This
article
in the
Daily
Beast
captures the passion that moves these freedom-loving
people to stand up to Russian aggression.
A Must
Read
Taking a Spoon to a Gunfight
David
Maxwell
writes
a withering piece on the
shortcomings of American foreign policy towards Russia over the past several
years.
And Maxwell knows what hes writing about.
He is the Associate Director of the Center for Security Studies and
the Security Studies Program in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign
Service of Georgetown University. He also is a retired US Army Special
Forces Colonel with 30 years of service and graduate of the US Army
Command and General Staff College, the School of Advanced Military
Studies and the National War College.
Submarine Under
the Ice
Several years ago I had the rare honor of
briefly accompanying the crew of the U.S. Navy fast attack submarine,
U.S.S. Annapolis , as it surfaced from under the ice near the
North Pole.
This fascinating
article
by
Thomas Friedman in last Sundays
New York
Times
shows with vivid clarity the commitment to excellence of our
Navys submariners.
It is well worth a
read.
Time is Running Out to Enter the House STEM

The deadline for the first annual U.S. House of Representatives STEM
