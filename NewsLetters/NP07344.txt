Rubio, Colleagues Introduce
Legislation Curbing Sexual Assaults On
Campuses
On Wednesday, Marco joined a
bipartisan group of senators
to
introduce new legislation
taking aim
at sexual assaults on college and
university campuses by protecting and
empowering students, and strengthening
accountability and transparency for
institutions
including
establishing stiff penalties for
non-compliance with the
legislations new standards for
training, data and best practices.
The legislation comes amid troubling
reports of cases of sexual violence at
colleges and universities, and is
intended to confront a scourge of sexual
violence against students, as available
statistics show that approximately 19
percent of undergraduate women have been
the victims of sexual assault. Because
many crimes are not reported, that number
could be substantially higher.

Rubio Comments On Senate Passage of
VA Reform Bill
Marco issued the following statement
regarding Senate passage of the
conference committee report to reform the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA):
The VA needs reform, and this
new law provides many new tools to help
right the ship. This law wont
solve every problem, but it will make
it easier to fire bad managers when
theyre failing at their jobs.
For too long, too many people working
at the VA have operated in a culture
that led them to believe they could get
away with lying to our veterans and not
treating them with the utmost respect
and efficiency. This is a chance to
sweep the culture of incompetence and
recklessness out the door. Its
critical that Congress continue
exercising its oversight role to ensure
this law is properly implemented and
that new problems that arise are
swiftly dealt with.
Although he is not a member of the
Senate Committee on Veterans
Affairs, Marco was asked to be part of
the House-Senate conference committee
organized to reconcile different versions
of VA reform legislation due to his
leadership in sponsoring the
VA
Management Accountability Act of
2014 , which passed the House in May
and was included in the Senate-passed VA
reform legislation in June.
Rubio Warns Of The Threat Of A
Nuclear Iran
Amid ongoing negotiations with Iran on
its nuclear program, Marco
warned
of the threats
a nuclear Iran poses
to U.S. security and interests during a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing.
Rubio: [S]omeday soon we will
wake up to the reality that they have
done a North Korea on us. They have
acquired a nuclear weapon, they can
hold the world hostage with that
weapon, and theres very few or
little we can do about it.

Rubio: Administrations Visa
Sanctions On Maduro Regime A Welcome
First Step, But More Needed
Marco, the Republican sponsor of the
Venezuela
Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society
Act of 2014 , welcomed the Obama
Administrations announcement that
it will impose travel-related visa bans
on Maduro regime officials involved in
serious human rights violations against
peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela. The
announcement comes on the heels of
Marcos recent calls to action on
July
9
and
July
24 , urging the President to impose
visa sanctions and asset freezes on the
Maduro regime.
The U.S. government should
use every tool at our disposal to hold
the Maduro regime accountable for its
human rights violations,
said Rubio . The Obama
Administration has taken an important
first step by announcing visa bans that
would restrict the travel of human
rights violators and their families to
the U.S. This action should be followed
up with asset freezes as well.
The House has passed a
Venezuela bill, and the sanctions bill
Ive introduced with Senators
Menendez and Nelson remains the most
comprehensive plan that exists in the
Senate to punish human rights violators
and support the democratic aspirations
of the Venezuelan people,
added Rubio . Im
pleased the administration has heeded
my calls to take initial action. I hope
the Senate soon passes legislation that
deals with the situation in Venezuela
in a more complete manner, and I will
continue pressing the administration to
do more.
On the Senate floor Thursday night,
Marco continued to urge the Senate to
pass his Venezuela sanctions bill. Watch

Agency Updates
The Department of State Bureau of
Consular Affairs Experiences
Technological Challenges
Last week, the
Department of State Bureau of Consular
Affairs experienced technological issues.
The Department of State Bureau of
Consular Affairs continues to make
progress restoring the nonimmigrant visa
system to full functionality. Processing
of immigrant visas cases, including
adoptions, remains a high priority. Some
Embassies and Consulates may temporarily
limit or reschedule nonimmigrant visa
interview appointments until more system
resources become available to process
these new applications. Additional
updates will be posted to
travel.state.gov as more information
becomes available.
