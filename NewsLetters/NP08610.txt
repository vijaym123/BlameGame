Friends,
Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there!
Honoring Our Veterans
America's service men and women paid a heavy price in the Vietnam War,
and we can never thank them enough.
I have had the privilege of honoring our WWII
and Korean War era veterans
for the
past two years, and this year we will have a very special ceremony
honoring all of those who served during the Vietnam War era.
On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at 10 AM at the First Baptist Church in
Columbia, all Vietnam War era veterans and their families are invited
to come and be recognized, and our doors are open to all who would like
to come and thank them for their service. More information can be found
at www.scott.senate.gov/veterans
or by calling toll-free (844) 820-0146.
Pressing the VA for Answers
The treatment that some of our veterans have gotten at the hands of the
VA has been unacceptable, and I was pleased to vote for a bill to allow
veterans
who have had trouble getting treatment
at the VA to see their local doctors instead.
I am continuing to press the VA for answers on the shameful delays in
treatment our veterans have received. Last Friday, I met with veterans
from across the state to hear
firsthand the problems they are having. Earlier this week, I sent a
letter to Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson demanding answers about all 13
South Carolina facilities. You can read more about it here
.
Empowering Workers
Last Thursday, I introduced the Empower Employees Act, empowering
federal employees to determine whether or not they want union dues
taken out of their paychecks, giving more freedom to folks to bring
additional money home to their families.
I certainly don't begrudge anyone the right to join a union, but
collecting dues is a responsibility that should fall to the unions
themselves, not the taxpayers.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.
Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can ever be of
service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
