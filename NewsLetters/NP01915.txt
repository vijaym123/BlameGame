Ted Cruz: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running for president of the United States&rdquo;
Ted Cruz just became the first Republican extremist to announce his campaign for president. A Ted Cruz presidency would be a DISASTER for our country.
It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Chris Christie throw their hats into the ring -- and those are only the &rdquo;frontrunners.&rdquo;
