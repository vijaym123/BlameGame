DAVID JOHNSON
Yesterday, Brad announced he was running for Congress. And since then, grassroots supporters have chipped in $27,500
-- in less than 24 hours!!
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
But we only have 4 HOURS LEFT to hit our moneybomb goal, and right now we&rsquo;re still $2,434 short.
If we&rsquo;re going to give Brad the strong start he needs for 2016, we need to put up the strongest showing we can .
