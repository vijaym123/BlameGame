Dear Friends,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work
of the 113th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well. I
wanted to highlight a few of things I did while I was traveling
through Utah's 2nd Congressional District last week.
Traveling Mobile Office:
The 2nd Congressional District stretches across a large
portion of Utah. While I have offices in Salt Lake City and St. George,
I also want to be available to constituents that live in all corners
of the district. To accommodate these individuals, I've launched a
'mobile office' program, where I set up temporary offices in various
counties and towns to meet with constituents, business and local leaders.
This last week I set up mobile offices in Fillmore, Cedar City and
Tooele. It's critical that I hear the questions and concerns of
constituents, as it helps shape policy priorities in Washington. If you are
interested in meeting with me at one of my mobile office locations,
request a meeting on my
website .
Visit to the Utah
Legislature:
Our Utah State legislature is truly doing
remarkable things. I was honored to visit the Legislature last week and report
to them on what I've been working on in Congress for the last year.
As I mentioned to both Utah's House and Senate, I wish the federal
government could be as productive as Utah's government, which continues to
pass meaningful legislation helping the state. As I spoke to the
legislature, one of the main ideas I shared with them, was the importance
of federalism. More often than not, Utah
not the federal government
knows what's best for its people. I want to reduce the size and
influence of the federal government and give more power to the states. For
more information on what I shared with Utah's legislature, you can
read articles in
the Deseret News
and
the Salt Lake Tribune .
Meeting
with Schools and Community Leaders:
While
traveling through the Utah last week, I spoke to students at Bountiful
High School and Fillmore Middle School about the biggest challenges
facing our nation. These are my favorite kind of speaking engagements.
I n addition to being friendly and energetic, these
students were also knowledgeable about the government and asked very
insightful questions. These students, teachers and administratiors should be
very proud.
In addition to meeting with schools, I was
able to meet with the Mayors of Fillmore, Bountiful, Cedar City and Salt
Lake County. These local leaders are all doing incredible things to
represent their constituents.
The Week
Ahead:
This week the House is expected to
vote and debate on legislation the Stop's Government Abuse. Visit
the
House Majority Leaders
website
