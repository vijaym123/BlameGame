The First 100 Days
Americans gave Republicans the keys to Congress in November, with one
clear message: It's time to work together. While there is clearly a lot
of work to do, here's a quick snapshot of what we have accomplished:

Protecting Employee Bonuses
Both employees and their employers lose out when complicated government
regulations make it tougher to run a business.
The government needs to
get out of the way and make it easier, not harder, for businesses who
want to reward employees with additional compensation. That is why this
week I introduced the Employee Bonus Protection Act, which is a
commonsense solution that will help hard working Americans and small
businesses.

Export Natural Gas:
Help our Allies, Increase Security
The United States has been called the "Saudi Arabia of natural gas" and
it is time for us to start taking full advantage of the resources we
have been blessed with. By exporting natural gas, in the form of
liquefied natural gas (or LNG), we can provide many of our allies in
Europe with an alternative to Russia's stronghold on this energy
commodity. I recently wrote about the economic and national security
benefits of LNG exports in a bipartisan op-ed with Rep. Steve Israel
(NY-3), which you can read HERE
