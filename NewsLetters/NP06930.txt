Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) announced today that he will be conducting a tour of manufacturing companies in the Tri-Cities/Richmond area on Wednesday and Thursday, August 20-21, 2014, to meet with the employees and business leaders who serve as the engine behind this key industry in the Fourth District.
Reinvigorating American manufacturing and strengthening the companies that are in the U.S. and the Fourth District by creating a national manufacturing strategy, reducing burdensome regulations, and lowering tax burdens, is essential to the economic future of our country, as well to maintaining the rich manufacturing legacy of the Fourth District, said Congressman Forbes.
