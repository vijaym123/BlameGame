Oregon's Senator Jeff Merkley THE OREGON REPORT

Making College Affordable
It's graduation season, and as many Oregon families understand too
well, it is increasingly harder to afford higher education in America.
We need an alternative to the broken model of mountains of debt and
increasing interest rates. That's why Jeff recently teamed up with
Elizabeth Warren to introduce legislation that will provide immediate
relief to students and graduates mired in debt. The Bank on Students
Emergency Loans Refinancing Act would allow student borrowers to
refinance their private and public student loans at a lower, fixed
rate. As the first in his family to attend college, Jeff is personally
invested in this issue. Pushing this bill is the latest in a series of
steps he has taken to make college attainable and affordable for all
Americans.

"
Creating Good Jobs while Supporting Oregon
In his continuous efforts to create good-paying middle class jobs for
Oregonians, Jeff led the Environment & Public Works Committee to pass a
bipartisan transportation bill last week that will put Americans to
work updating our crumbling infrastructure. The result will be more
jobs for Oregonians and much-needed repairs on roads, bridges, and
highways.
And this week, the Senate will vote on the Water Resources Development
Act, which offers many funding opportunities for Oregon communities,
including $90 million dedicated to the maintenance of small ports. Jeff
fought for increased funding for small ports to support Oregon's
coastal communities, where funding for dredging is essential to the
economy. A big win for Oregon is the bill's Water Infrastructure
Financing Innovation Act (WIFIA), a pilot program Jeff introduced in
2012. WIFIA provides loans and loan guarantees so that communities can
afford critical construction, maintenance and repairs in areas like
flood control and wastewater infrastructure.

good jobs: "First-term senator wants to keep fighting for working-class
Oregonians
"
Standing Up for Veterans
Last week, Jeff built on his previous efforts to raise awareness about
another important issue receiving too little attention: the high rate
of suicide among our veterans. A recent study by the Oregon Public
Health Authority found that suicide is the number-one cause of death
among veterans age 45 and younger. "We would never leave our wounded
troops behind on the battlefield," Jeff said. "We can't leave them
behind at home." Jeff is supporting the Suicide Prevention for America's
Veterans Act, which will increase and improve the resources available
to our service members when they return home. Key measures include a
10-year extension of special combat eligibility for mental health care
and incentives to attract more qualified mental health professionals to
VA hospitals nationwide.
Celebrating Memorial Day
This Monday, please join Jeff in remembering the brave men and women
who have given their lives to protect our nation. Today, over 30,000
Americans continue to serve in Afghanistan--the longest ongoing war in
our nation's history. We can commemorate those who have died in
protecting our nation by taking good care of those who are fighting for
us still today. Over 300,000 veterans call Oregon home, and they
deserve the best resources. Jeff will continue to fight to support our
service members before, during and after deployment.

Jeff is a native of Myrtle Creek, Oregon and the son of a millwright.
The first in his family to go to college, Jeff still lives in the same
working class neighborhood that his parents eventually settled in and
his kids go to the same public high school he attended. Making the
'American Dream' a reality for others as it has been for him is what
got Jeff Merkley involved in public life and is what continues to keep
him fighting for Oregon families.
In the four years he has been in the U.S. Senate, Jeff Merkley has been
focused on creating jobs and getting our nation back on track. He led
the fight against high-risk gambling on Wall Street, has been a leading
voice for aggressive action to take on the foreclosure crisis, and
wrote the law that helps small businesses raise money on the internet
so they can grow and create jobs.
Jeff and his wife Mary have been married for twenty years and have two
children, Brynne and Jonathan, and an Airedale terrier, Sadie.
