Dear
Friends,
Are you a veteran looking
for a job? Do you have a
family member, friend or
neighbor who fought for our
country and is looking for
employment?
On Monday, August 18, and
Monday, August 25, the
Delaware Delegation will host
two
Veterans
Jobs Fairs .
As a veteran of the Navy,
I know firsthand about the
sacrifices our military
members make while defending
our home abroad. I also know
that the transition back to
civilian life can sometimes
be difficult
and as
our economy continues to
recover, some veterans in our
state are still searching for
long-term employment. But
these brave men and women
have the leadership traits
and skills that make them
fantastic candidates for
employers
which is
why so many employers are
excited about this
opportunity, too.
Both fairs will host more
than 30 employers in the
private, public and
non-profit sectors that will
present a wide range of
opportunities to Delaware
veterans. More details can be
found below.
The first Veterans Jobs
Fair will be this Monday,
August 18, at the Carlisle
Fire Company in Milford,
Delaware.
