Dear Friend,
As Montanans, we know the importance of
fulfilling our promises to veterans and ensuring they receive the support and
services they deserve.
But earlier this week, a national
review of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care facilities
found staggering problems, including average wait times of 48 days
for Montana veterans for their first primary-care visit
three times
longer than the VAs goal of 14 days.
To fix this problem,
I helped introduce the
Veterans Access to Care Act , to ensure
our veterans receive the care they need in a timely manner. It also
provides veterans who live long drives from the closest VA medical
center
like many Montana veterans
the opportunity to
receive care from a medical provider closer to home.
The
bill requires the VA to offer non-VA care at the departments expense to
any enrolled veteran who cannot get an appointment within VA wait
time goals or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA medical
facility.
Im happy to tell you that the
Veterans Access to Care
Act
passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan
support.
As the son of a Marine, serving Montanas veterans has been my
priority since Day 1. You can read more about my efforts to reform
veterans services and bring accountability to the VA by clicking
