Friend -- I emailed you today already.
But now I&rsquo;m emailing you again.
It&rsquo;s because this absolutely CANNOT wait!
You MUST take a 30 second break and read this email:
Twelve Senate races are within five points. TWELVE!
The Republicans need to win just six to take over.
It&rsquo;s just plain ALARMING that Senate control is at 50-50 odds.
There&rsquo;s NOT MUCH time left -- but YOU can break the tie.
If you help us fund our final-weekend Get Out The Vote push, Democrats WILL get enough voters to the polls to eke out a victory.
But if our grassroots support falls short, it will hand Mitch McConnell an opening to take over the Senate.
The final end-of-month deadline falls in 72 hours: Will you pitch in before then? Your gift will be triple-matched and sent DIRECTLY to battlegrounds to fund GOTV!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Our grassroots supporters have put us so close to victory. I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for that.
I don&rsquo;t get to tell you enough how much I appreciate your support.
After leading 141 filibusters and spending 30 years creating gridlock in Washington, Mitch McConnell could be gone in exactly one week.
That&rsquo;s all thanks to you.
Now, let&#39;s win!
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
