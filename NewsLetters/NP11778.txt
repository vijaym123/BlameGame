Dear Friend,
My
number one priority is to stay in touch with you about what's going on in
the Central Valley and my work in Washington, D.C. on your behalf. As
we're nearing election season, official U.S. House of Representatives
rules limit the type of communication my office can have with you
during the 90 days prior to an election unless you have signed up to
receive updates from me.
California's primary election takes
place on June 3rd, which means that until that date, I can only send you
crucial updates if you opt in. Please let me know what issues are
most important to you by filling out the survey below.
You
can also stay up to date on what I'm doing by subscribing to
my weekly newsletter , following me on
Twitter
or
Instagram , subscribing to
my YouTube page
or liking
my Facebook
page .
I always appreciate hearing from you. Your
views help me to represent you in Congress.
Please
contact me via email
or give my Modesto office a call at
209-579-5458.
