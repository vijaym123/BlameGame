Fundamentally Flawed
Dear Friend,
Thursday I took to the House floor to speak out against Obamacare's
disastrous impact on families in my district. It's clear that Obamacare
is fundamentally flawed in both concept and execution. Dictated
government orders cannot beat free-market choices. As a healthcare
professional, I will continue to do all that I can to protect the
American people from Obamacare. Click HERE
or below to watch my speech.
What's More Popular than Obamacare?
In the month of October, just 27,000 people signed up for Obamacare on
the federally-run exchange - healthcare.gov - according to data
released Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services. This
includes Arizona, where just 739 people selected a plan.

The Obama Administration's enrollment goal for the month of October was
500,000 people. It's now a fact that more people have had their health
insurance cancelled under Obamacare than have signed up for it.
Share Your Obamacare Story
Healthcare.gov continues to malfunction, millions of Americans are
losing the insurance coverage they were promised they could keep and
premiums for families are skyrocketing. I want to hear your stories.
Together we can show President Obama and Senate Democrats the damage
Obamacare is inflicting on families in Arizona. Click HERE
to share your Obamacare story.
I Will Continue Fighting
On Wednesday, my major jobs and conservation legislation, the Southeast
Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act, was placed on the calendar
but not voted on. This setback will not discourage me from my continued
fight for this important Arizona jobs bill.
The Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act authorizes a
federal land exchange that will open the third largest undeveloped
copper resource in the world, located near Superior, Arizona. In
exchange, more than 5,000 acres of high-value Arizona conservation
lands will be protected. The mine would create more than 3,700 local
jobs, generate more than $61.4 billion in economic activity and could
supply 25 percent or more of the nation's domestic copper demand. Click

to read more
about this legislation.
I will continue to work to ensure the enactment of the Southeast
Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. Click HERE
to read my official statement.
Arizona Deserves a Refund
Wednesday I joined Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake and Reps. Kyrsten
Sinema, Ann Kirkpatrick, Trent Franks, Ron Barber, David Schweikert,
and Matt Salmon in signing a letter to Director Jon Jarvis of the
National Park Service requesting the $465,000 that Arizona paid to
reopen Grand Canyon National Park during the recent government shutdown
be fully refunded. During the government shutdown of 1995, Arizona
provided $370,125 to keep the Park open. The National Park Service
eventually repaid Arizona for that expense. We expect no less this
time. Click HERE

Great to See So Many Smiles
Friday I was honored to deliver the keynote address at the Arizona Tax
Research Association's (ATRA) Conference in Scottsdale. Not only is it
good to be back in Arizona after spending the week in D.C. but it was
also great to see so many smiling faces. I appreciate all the work ATRA
does in support of sound fiscal policy and limited government.

Mint Chocolate Chip, Please
Last Friday I toured the Blue Bell Ice Cream plant in Phoenix. The
15,000-square-foot facility includes office and retail space as well as
a 20-below-zero freezer, which stores their products. I enjoyed hearing
from the Blue Bell employees about what they do and the obstacles they
face. I also enjoyed some Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream.

Obamacare Malady of the Week
26,794: that is the number of people who "selected a plan" through the
federal Obamacare exchanges during the month of October. The Obama
Administration's goal for the first month of the exchanges was 500,000.
Congressional District 4: DID YOU KNOW?
Before Payson, AZ was an official townsite, it was called Green Valley.
There were just 42 people living there in 1882 when the townsite became
official after a survey was completed by James Callaghan and John Hise,
Surveyor General of Arizona.
