Discussing Arming Syrian Rebels on The Blaze
TV
Earlier this week, I joined The Blaze TV to discuss the
possibility of the U.S. government arming the Syrian rebels to help fight
ISIS terrorists. ISIS poses a grave threat to the region, but also to the
United States. We must be firm and decisive in our actions to combat
and ultimately destroy ISIS. With that said, I fear that the
President's strategy to arm Syrian rebels, many of whom we know very little
about, is a flawed strategy. Before casting such a critical vote, I
polled you, my constituents to get your feedback. After deep deliberation
and reviewing the feedback I received from you, I voted against arming
the Syrian rebels. We must eradicate the cancer that is ISIS, but I do
not believe that handing over U.S. arms is the best way to do
so.

Championing American Jobs and Energy
Independence
Getting Americans back to work is my top priority in Congress. On
Thursday, the House voted on the Jobs for America Act, H.R. 4, a
jobs package comprised of 15 House-passed bills that will spur economic
growth and promote job creation. We also voted on H.R. 2, the
American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act, a
compilation of 14 bills that will bolster America's energy independence
while creating more American jobs. Both bills passed the House with
bipartisan support and I believe it is time for the Senate to follow
through and bring this legislation up for consideration.It's time we
put partisan politics aside and get Americans back to work.
IRS Accountability Bill Passes the
House
Earlier this week, my bill, the Federal
Records Accountability Act, H.R. 5170, passed the House with unanimous
support. The bill will hold employees accountable who fail to archive
official communications or intentionally destroy them. H.R. 5170 was
introduced following an ongoing scandal involving former Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) official Lois Lerner who was under investigation for
the targeting of politically-conservative groups. It came to light
that Lerner and numerous other IRS employees destroyed or failed to
preserve emails and other official communications relevant to the
investigation, in violation of record-keeping laws. The bill now
moves to the Senate for a vote. You can read more about it

Meeting with Western North Carolina Business
Leaders
It was great to meet with members of the Asian American
Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA), led by Pratik Bhakta of
Asheville. It's always a pleasure to meet with constituents when they are
traveling to Washington, DC.
Debbie
and I at the White House Congressional Picnic
Earlier this week, Debbie and I had the opportunity
to attend the White House Congressional Picnic. I enjoyed spending
time with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in an informal
setting. Like Reagan once said, "all great change in America begins at the
dinner table."
