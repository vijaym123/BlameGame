Dear Friends,
We live in a times of
uncertainty
times of economic uncertainty, wars, civil unrest, acts of
nature, and acts of man.
But even in spite of all of this, we
Americans have so much for which to be thankful.
The Thanksgiving
holiday is a time to remember these blessings.
In
America, we are blessed with freedoms that make self-governance and
democracy possible, and we have an opportunity to create a better life
for ourselves and our children.
But these freedoms are not free,
and throughout our history, our nation has been called to defend our
right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
We are fortunate
to have men and women who willingly, courageously, and selflessly
serve to protect them.
Arkansans are especially blessed.
Not only do we enjoy Americas freedoms, but we live in a state whose
beauty, hospitality, and rich history of entrepreneurialism are
second-to-none.
I could not be more grateful to serve as
the voice for Arkansass Third District in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
I take this responsibility and my constituents trust
very seriously.
As we craft laws and work towards passing real
reforms
including restoring fiscal discipline, easing the regulatory
burden, and reforming our tax code and mandatory programs to get America
back on track, I always have the best interest of Arkansans in
mind.
In addition to passing laws that make life a little easier
for those in the Natural State, my staff and I work every day to help
you navigate the bureaucratic maze and cut through red tape, so you
can get answers from federal agencies.
This year, Im proud to
report assisting nearly 750 of you.
Today on
Thanksgiving, as I pause to consider the fortunes bestowed upon us, I count you
as mine.
Thank you for your trust and the continued opportunity
to serve you.
Happy Thanksgiving, and God
bless.
Congressman Steve
