Veterans Day is an opportunity to say "Thank you" to those patriots whove answered the call to defend us, going into harms way so that we can enjoy the blessings of freedom, peace, and prosperity. Freedom is not free
it comes at incredible cost. Today, and every day, let us never forget that.
We must also remember our military families, who are left to carry on while their spouse, parent, or child is away serving on the front lines. Though they may not wear the uniform, they too serve and sacrifice much for the cause of freedom.
Few opportunities are more meaningful to me as a Congressman than when I am given the chance to help our veterans, whether it is obtaining long overdue medals for a hero of WWII, securing VA benefits for a struggling veteran of Korea or Vietnam, or paying tribute to the life of a soldier that was cut short defending freedom in Iraq or Afghanistan.
As the son, grandson, and brother of veterans, I have and will continue to fight for our nations soldiers and military veterans. As President Calvin Coolidge once said "A nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten." I am committed to making sure we never forget.
Yours respectfully,
Jeb Hensarling
