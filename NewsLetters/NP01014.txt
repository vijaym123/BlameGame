A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
May 1, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate debated the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act of 2015
, which passed unanimously out of the Foreign Relations
Committee on April 14, 2015. On Wednesday, I spoke on the floor of the
Senate
to explain why a nuclear armed
Iran is a danger not just to the Middle East, but to the peace and
security of the entire world.
The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 is the single-most
important vote any member of this Senate is going to take in a long,
long time. Giving the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House oversight on this
agreement is absolutely essential to giving a voice to the American
people. We must do everything in our power to prevent Iran from
achieving a nuclear weapons capability. Relaxing sanctions should not
even be a consideration until Iran ends its work toward obtaining
nuclear weapons, and I still believe that this administration is more
concerned about pleasing the other side before protecting our national
security.
Holding the VA Accountable
Thi
s week, as chairman of the
Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I called on the Department of
Veterans Affairs to address the problems that led to the Veterans
Health Administrations placement on the U.S. Government Accountability
Offices 2015 High Risk List.
At the committee hearing, I made it clear to the VA that it is
unacceptable for the Veterans Health Administration to be listed as
high risk, and will continue to scrutinize the department and hold
top officials accountable until the necessary steps are taken to end
the overall systemic failure of responsibilities throughout the
Veterans Health Administration.
Georgia Military Coalition
I am leading meetings with other Georgia Congressional delegation
members to engage with senior officials from each of the Armed Services
to discuss the importance of Georgia-based military equities and assets
that play a critical role in our national defense. I am committed to
helping find a responsible solution to end sequestration and protect
our military installations in Georgia and support the surrounding
communities.
In April, I met with Army Secretary McHugh to relay the support from
our entire states delegation.
This week, I continued these
meetings and met with U.S. Air Force Major General Lee Levy, incoming
commander of USAF Materiel Command, to discuss Robins Air Force Base,
Brigadier General Joe Jarrard, Adjutant General of the Georgia National
Guard, and U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General William Faulkner,
Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics, to discuss the
Marine Corps Logistics Base in Albany. These meetings will be followed
by visits to Georgias military installations later in the year.
Increasing Domestic Energy Production
I joined members of the U.S. Senate and House to send a letter to U.S.
Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell
demanding the removal of harmful
restrictions on offshore energy development. Our nation needs to keep
its commitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will
further advance job creation, economic growth and energy security in
the United States
Restoring the Efficacy of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution
Recently, I co-sponsored the Restoring the 10th Amendment Act
to set up a framework that would provide
states with legal standing and framework for challenging
unconstitutional or burdensome federal regulations and executive orders
before they go into effect. Our country was built on keeping government
close to the people by allowing them to make decisions at the state and
local level, and the powers given to the federal government enumerated
in the Constitution are supposed to be minimal. This legislation would
help return us to the framework laid out by the Founding Fathers.
Military Academy Day
My annual Military Academy Day
on May 9, 2015, is quickly approaching,
and I am excited to meet with students from all over
our
great state.
This event is the largest of its kind in the country, and it is
designed to familiarize students in grades eight through 12 with the
application and nomination process for our nations five military
service academies. In addition to meeting members of the Georgia
delegation, students can also meet representatives from all five
academies. Make sure to register online
by
Monday, May 4, 2015, if you plan to attend.
Whats on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will be voting on whether to override the
presidents veto of the Congressional Review Act resolution that would
stop the National Labor Relations Boards (NLRB) ambush election
rule. I have been fighting against unfair rulings such as this one by
the NLRB since President Obama took office.
I will continue to fight to restore a
level playing field, protect free speech and ensure that workers are
afforded the opportunity to make informed decisions about their right
to organize, while safeguarding their personal information and privacy.

Dear

This

the

debated
the

Review
Act
of
2015 ,
which
passed

out
of
the

On

I

of
the

to
explain
why
a

armed
Iran
is
a

not
just
to
the
Middle
East,
but
to
the
peace
and
security
of
the
entire
world.
The
Iran
Nuclear

Review
Act
of
2015
is
the
single-most
important
vote
any
member
of
this
Senate
is
going
to
take
in
a
long,

Giving
the

and
the
U.S.

on

is
absolutely

to
giving

voice
to
the
American
people.
We
must
do
everything
in
our

to
prevent
Iran
from
achieving
a

weapons
capability.
Relaxing
sanctions
should
not
even
be
a
consideration
until
Iran
ends
its
work
toward
obtaining
nuclear
weapons,
and
I
still
believe
that
this
administration
is
more
concerned
about
pleasing
the
other
side
before
protecting
our
national
security.

I

that

placement

At

I
made

to
the
VA
that
it
is
unacceptable
for
the
Veterans

to
be

and
will
continue

the

Georgia
Military

I

members
to

to

I

to
helping
find
a
responsible
solution
to
end
sequestration
and
protect
our
military
installations
in
Georgia
and
support
the
surrounding
communities.
In
April,
I
met
with
Army
Secretary
McHugh
to
relay
the
support
from
our
entire
state&#146;s
delegation.
This
week,
I
continued
these
meetings
and
met
with
U.S.
Air
Force
Major
General
Lee
Levy,
incoming
commander
of
USAF
Materiel
Command,
to
discuss
Robins
Air
Force
Base,
Brigadier
General
Joe
Jarrard,
Adjutant
General
of
the
Georgia
National
Guard,
and
U.S.
Marine
Corps
Lieutenant
General
William
Faulkner,
Deputy
Commandant
for
Installations
and
Logistics,
to
discuss
the
Marine
Corps
Logistics
Base
in
Albany.
These
meetings
will
be
followed
by
visits
to
Georgia&#146;s
military
installations
later
in
the
year.
Increasing

I
joined
members
of
the
U.S.

send
a
letter
to
U.S.
Department
of
the
Interior
Secretary
Sally
Jewell
demanding
the
removal
of
harmful
restrictions
on
offshore
energy
development.
Our
nation
needs
to keep
its
commitment
to
an
&#147;all-of-the-above&#148;
energy
strategy
that
will
further
advance
job
creation,
economic

and
energy
security
in
the
United

Restoring

Recently,
I
co-sponsored
the
Restoring
the

to
set
up
a
framework
that
would
provide
states
with
legal
standing
and
framework
for

and
executive
orders
before
they
go

Our
country
was
built
on
keeping
government
close
to
the
people
by
allowing
them
to
make
decisions
at
the
state
and
local
level,
and
the
powers
given
to
the
federal
government
enumerated
in
the
Constitution
are
supposed
to
be
minimal.
This
legislation
would
help
return
us
to
the
framework
laid
out
by
the
Founding
Fathers.
Military
Academy
Day
My
annual
Military
Academy

on
May
9,
2015,
is
quickly
approaching,
and
I

This

is
the
largest

and
it
is

for
our
nation&#146;s

academies.
In

Make

I
