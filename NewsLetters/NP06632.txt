Dear Friend,
Congratulations to New Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church on 106 years of faithful service to the Polk County community. It was an honor to join Reverend Edward Green Jr., Sheriff Grady Judd, Winter Haven City Manager Deric Feacher, and other community leaders last Sunday to celebrate their long history and rich heritage.
On Thursday, I spent a day in Auburndale, walking down Main Street to stop in and talk to many local business owners, as well as visiting several other locations, including:
-	Richard Hamanns Please You Barber &amp; A Style Shop
-	Auburndale Chamber of Commerce
-	The Historic Ephraim M. Baynard House
-	Adams Cold Storage
-	ServiceMaster of Polk County
-	Ikes Eats and Treats
-	Auburndale Speedway

Last Tuesday, I was invited to the Lake County Golden Triangle Rotary to provide an update on current issues and answer questions from the Mt. Dora, Eustis, and Tavares members. During the question and answer time, a constituent shared how my office had been able to help one of his friends after he had given him a copy of my
Constituent Services Guide .
I am always grateful to hear that the services we provide are helping so many of the friends and neighbors in our community.
Some of the other visits I made in North Lake last week included:
-	Rafiki Foundation (Rafiki means friend in Swahili)
-	Barnwood Bar-B-Que in Eustis
-	Leesburg Sunset Rotary
-	Midway Baptist Church in Leesburg
-	Leesburg Sunrise Kiwanis Club

Last week, I was privileged to spend quite a bit of time in West Orange County. Jim Ferber, the President and CEO of the Central Florida YMCA, along with many of the local YMCA stakeholders, including Barbara Roper and two of her sons, took me on a tour of the Roper YMCA in Winter Garden. Following the tour, I sat down with key YMCA leaders to discuss ways that I can help them as they seek to serve and enhance our community.
It was a privilege to visit with other businesses and organizations in West Orange County and spend a day in Ocoee, which included:
-	Speaking at the Ocoee Rotary Club
-	Touring the Historic Withers Maguire House
-	Seeing the new Lakeshore Center
-	Meeting the staff, doctors, and administrators at the Ocoee Health Center
-	Sitting down with Mayor Vandergrift, receiving a tour of the Administration Building, and meeting the city staff who are serving the Ocoee community
These visits are just a sample of the many opportunities I had to interact with and hear from constituents last week. For more pictures and information on these and additional stops that I made in the district, you can follow me on Twitter

Constituent Corner:
Earlier this year, a constituent from Groveland contacted my office for assistance with his military paperwork. The Army Sergeant was scheduled to begin classes in just under two weeks, and still had not been cleared. Not only was the first day of classes approaching, but the delay was endangering the constituents ability to settle his family back in Florida before the term began.
My office submitted a Congressional Inquiry on the Sergeants behalf, and followed up with the Army shortly afterwards. I was pleased to hear that the issue was quickly resolved and the paperwork successfully processed.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
On Friday, I participated in a Statewide WRRDA Town Hall at the Tampa Port Authority with Port of Tampa leaders and Rep. Steve Southerland. We discussed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act and how it will improve our ports, support our infrastructure, and fuel the economic engine of Florida.
Additionally, I promoted the process by which the WRRDA bill was passed.
A few months ago, I saw my old Civics teacher during a reunion for Evans High School. In the course of our conversation, he asked if Congress utilizes the legislative process like he taught me all those years ago. Unfortunately, the textbook process of how a bill becomes a law is not used as much as it should be. But it is a good system, and I am advocating that we return to that process, called regular order.
The WRRDA bill is an example of how regular order can and should work. Starting simply as an idea, the bill was drafted and thoroughly vetted by members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure before moving on to consideration by the full House of Representatives; the Senate did the same thing with their committee and their version of the bill too. The differences between these two versions were then negotiated by a Conference Committee that was made up of both Republicans and Democrats from the House and the Senate. As a member of the Conference Committee, I can assure you this process was neither easy nor quick, but eventually a final version was agreed upon that included input from both parties in both chambers. That agreement was then overwhelmingly approved by the full House and the full Senate before being sent to the President for him to sign it into law.
The process works! The likelihood of unintended consequences are diminished because the bill is vetted by members of both parties and both Houses of Congress. A lot of the problems in Washington could be mitigated if we would only return to regular order, and the WRRDA bill is an example that it can be done.
