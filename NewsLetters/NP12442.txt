Dear
Friends,
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, of which I
am a member, will have a full committee field hearing, The Charleston,
W.Va., Chemical Spill: Cause, Response and Prevention,
at
9 a.m. Monday, Feb. 10,
at the Kanawha County
Courthouse. The hearing is open to the public.
The witnesses will
be:
Gary Southern, president, Freedom Industries
(invited)
Jeff McIntyre, president, West Virginia American
Water
Jimmy Gianato, director, West Virginia Division
of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management
Gordon Merry, director, Cabell County Office of Emergency
Services
Rafael Moure-Eraso, chairman, U.S Chemical Safety
Board
Dale Petry, director, Kanawha County Homeland Security and
Emergency Management
Mike Dorsey, director, Homeland
Security and Emergency Response, West Virginia Department of Environmental
Protection
Dr. Letitia E. Tierney, commissioner,
Bureau for Public Health and State Health Officer, West Virginia Department
of Health and Human Resources
Many questions about
the spill itself and the response of both the company involved and
government agencies remain unanswered. As a mother, a grandmother, and a
resident of the Kanawha Valley, I understand the fear, trepidation
and anger that people feel, because I feel it too. Mondays hearing will
help ensure that answers about this spill are provided to the people
of West Virginia.
WATER HEARING ON CAPITOL
HILL
I spoke Tuesday at the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committees Water and Wildlife Subcommittee
hearing, Examination of the Safety and Security of Drinking Water
Supplies Following the Central West Virginia Drinking Water Crisis,"
joining Senators Joe Manchin and Jay Rockefeller and Rep. Nick Rahall in
giving opening statements at the hearing.

PROTECTING SPORTING TRADITIONS
I voted yes this
week on legislation to protect the rights of Americans to fish and hunt
on public lands. H.R. 3590, the Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational
Enhancement Act, passed the U.S. House of Representatives
234-185.
Americans have enjoyed hunting and fishing for generations.
Sons and daughters have bonded with their parents and grandparents over
afternoons spent by a lake or mornings spent in a tree stand. Im
proud to support the Second Amendment and the right of law-abiding
Americans to keep and bear arms. This important legislation reaffirms that
right on federal lands, and I urge the Senate to join with the House
and approve this bill.
Among other provisions, the
legislation would:
Reaffirm that fishing, hunting and
shooting are important, traditional sports that should be permitted to take
place on public lands
Require federal land managers to
allow and facilitate hunting, fishing and recreational shooting on
U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management
lands
Protect law-abiding Americans constitutional right to bear arms on land
owned by the Army Corps of Engineers.
