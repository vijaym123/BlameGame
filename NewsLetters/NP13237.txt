Dear Friends:
May 2014 bring you and your family
good health, happiness and love. May it bring the American people
closer to the principles of our Nations Founders, with responsible and
limited government. And to the world, may it bring peace and goodwill
to mankind.
With my regards and best wishes for the New
Year, I remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
