This week, IRS Commissioner Koskinen testified before Congress about the IRS' plans to oversee billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies under the Presidents healthcare law. When asked by the House Ways and Means, Health Subcommittee Chairman Brady if the IRS will follow the law in the cases of ineligible individuals receiving Obamacare subsidies, who will eventually have to pay subsidies back to the IRS under the law, Koskinen said: Wherever we can, we follow the law.

That is not how the law works. Following the law is not optional
not for you, not for me, and not for the IRS. Thats why I have been relentless in calling for accountability at the IRS
through
appointing an independent special counsel
to the investigation into IRS abuse, and by
prohibiting the massive expansion of the IRS
required to implement the Presidents healthcare law.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I also supported the No Subsidies Without Verification Act,
H.R.4805 , to prohibit the federal government from providing any insurance subsidies until a program that can fully verify an applicants eligibility is put in place. Additionally, I supported a bill,
H.R. 2531 , to prohibit the IRS from asking taxpayers questions regarding religious, political, or social beliefs.
