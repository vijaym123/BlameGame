Dear Friend,
Almost 250 years ago our Founding Fathers eloquently wrote that the inalienable right to life isn&#146;t granted by Congress or any legislature, but is endowed by our Creator. Sadly, even as our scientific knowledge and medical expertise advance, this inalienable right is still being debated in Washington, D.C. We know that caring doctors and nurses today can save babies born prematurely at 20 weeks and help them go on to lead normal lives. But, sadly, the opportunity to grow and thrive is not protected for babies at that same stage in the womb.
Last week, I voted to be a voice for those that cannot yet speak. The Pain&#45;Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which I cosponsored and has passed the House of Representatives, is one of the most significant pieces of pro&#45;life legislation to ever come before the House. This bill defends life and provides protection for babies that have already reached five months in the womb. At this stage, babies can feel pain and are developed enough that in many cases they can go on to live outside the womb with proper medical care.
This bill reflects the compassionate and caring feelings of the American people to protect the life of the unborn. In poll after poll, folks across the country agree with us here southeast and southern Missouri that it is our obligation to protect babies from painful late&#45;term abortions. In a CNN poll last year, 58 percent of respondents opposed abortions with &#147;few&#148; or &#147;no&#148; exceptions. A CBS News poll found 59 percent of respondents thought abortions should have stricter limits or not be permitted at all. A Quinnipiac poll found that 60 percent of adults, including 59 percent of women, support restrictions on abortion after 20 weeks. Our message of protection for every precious life resonates far beyond just our community.
The fight to protect life at all stages is a fight I am passionately leading in Washington. I will continue to be a voice for the children that deserve our protection and continue to share our message of compassion, because life is truly a gift from God.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
Congratulations to the Class of 2015. Thank you to the graduates of Dora High School for letting me celebrate with you&#33; One graduate of Dora High School, Taylor Brooks, will be attending the United States Military Academy at West Point in the fall.
This week students from Missouri University of Science and Technology visited my office to talk about upcoming legislation and making college more affordable.
President Obama unilaterally decided to delay unpopular portions of Obamacare during election seasons, instead of letting the American people see the truth. It&#146;s completely unacceptable. This week we held a hearing to investigate the administration&#146;s continued overreach.
Watch my questions about the president&#146;s unlawful actions here.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
