News from Representative Lou Barletta
June 10, 2014
Veterans Deserve Better from VA Medical Centers
Participating in a medal presentation ceremony for nine of our
district's veterans last year
We just observed Memorial Day a few weeks ago.
It is a holiday to
honor those who have given their lives to protect this country.
In all
of our armed conflicts, Americans have spilled their blood and given
their lives - in many cases on behalf of people in foreign lands they
had never met or heard of before.
Our Veterans epitomize what it is to
be an American, and we owe them a debt we can never truly repay.
That is why it is so disturbing that in recent weeks we learned of a
scandal of incredible proportions at the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA).
This is a veterans health care system that is so inept, corrupt,
and broken that 40 veterans have died while waiting for treatment, and
government officials are alleged to have falsified records to cover up
how long waiting lists really were.
The recent Inspector General's
report is yet more evidence that the problem is systemic, widespread,
and certainly not limited to one hospital in Phoenix.
Although Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki has resigned, this
is a problem larger than just one man.
This is not a problem that is
exclusive to one administration or one party.
This is not a Democrat
or Republican problem.
This is an American problem.
And we should all
be horrified and outraged.
In the House, we have already taken steps toward reforming the VA with
the bipartisan passage of a measure that would give the secretary
greater latitude in removing senior officials in the agency.
I wish
the Senate would follow our lead.
In the meantime, there are a number
of proposals being offered to improve the VA and its service to
veterans, and I am eager to examine each one on its own merits.
I will
be looking at all of the ideas with the goal of making sure that our
veterans receive the care they deserve and were promised.
And I promise you this: we will get to the bottom of this, we will hold
people accountable, and we will address the problem.
Those who sign up
to serve in our military know that they may end up as casualties in
some foreign land.
They do not expect to become a statistic after
they've already returned safely home.

PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO BOOST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND AID IN FLOOD
RISK PREVENTION
On May 20, the House passed legislation to promote American
competitiveness and economic growth by maintaining an effective
waterway infrastructure, while also supporting strong flood protection.
In the form of a conference report reconciling differences in House and
Senate versions, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA,
H.R. 3080) passed the House of Representatives 412 to 4.
The
legislation originated in the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, where I am the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic
Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.
On June 10,
the president signed this legislation into law.
This legislation increases the roles of the private sector and local
communities, and it also creates opportunities for public-private
partnerships.
Further, WRRDA strengthens Congressional oversight,
restricts executive overreach, cuts red tape, and provides transparency
in the selection of projects.
And critically for our part of
Pennsylvania, WRRDA helps with flood risk management.

view the remarks I made on the House floor in support of this bill,

ESTABLISHMENT OF A HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE EVENTS SURROUNDING
BENGHAZI
On May 8, the House passed H.Res. 567, legislation that establishes a
House Select Committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist
attack in Benghazi which will be headed by Rep. Trey Gowdy (GA-04).
As an original co-sponsor of H.Res. 36, a measure that called for the
creation of a Select Committee on Benghazi and was used as the original
basis for the most recent House action on this issue, I was pleased to
be able to vote in favor of this bill.
What is most important to remember about the events in Benghazi of
September 11, 2012 is that four Americans, including our ambassador to
Libya, lost their lives.
Their memories, their families, and the
American people deserve to know the truth about what happened leading
up to the terrorist attack on our embassy, the circumstances on the
ground, and the aftermath and subsequent false explanations.
That's
what this Select Committee will be tasked to examine, and I trust my
colleague, Congressman Trey Gowdy, with that important responsibility.
People want answers.
Why were repeated requests for more security
ignored?
What was the immediate reaction from the White House on that
fateful night?
And who decided to spin a bogus political story to
explain the attacks, blame an obscure Internet video, and for what
purpose?
There are some who insist that Benghazi is yesterday's news, but that
fails to explain why relevant documents have been selectively released
gradually and heavily redacted, or sometimes not at all.
Recent
threats of boycotting the proceedings indicate a fear of a full
examination, serve only to further politicize the search for the truth,
and provide cover to those who want to wish the whole tragic episode
away.
This committee will seek the truth, but it will also look forward in an
effort to make sure something like this never happens again.
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION RELEASES MORE THAN 36,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
It was recently revealed that last year the Obama Administration
released more than 36,000 illegal immigrants held by the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE).
Some of those
released had been convicted of serious violent crimes.
Among the freed
prisoners, who previously had been in deportment proceedings, were 116
who had been convicted of homicide, 43 who were convicted of voluntary
manslaughter, and one who was convicted of a crime classified by ICE as
"homicide-willful kill-public official-gun."
This should put to rest any belief that the Obama Administration is
taking illegal immigration seriously, and also throw cold water on any
talk about an immigration reform bill that even remotely resembles
amnesty.
Our borders are not secure, our immigration laws are being ignored, and
violent criminals are being set free to roam the streets.
This should
be a wakeup call for anyone who cares about the rule of law, and a
clear signal that no one should consider amnesty for illegal immigrants
already present in this country - particularly while this
administration is in office.
Aside from being a public safety concern, this is also an economic
issue.
If we dangle the prize of amnesty for those who have already
broken our laws, it will inevitably encourage millions more to cross
our borders illegally.
There are hard working citizens who are legally
present finding it difficult to find work, and the last thing we should
do is to open the gates to more competition for already scarce jobs.
I encourage all of my colleagues in Congress to digest this news and
stand firmly against any legislation that contains or leads to amnesty.

these illegal immigrants, click here.

"Hero of Main Street" Award
I have been recognized as a "Hero of Main Street" by the National
Retail Federation (NRF) for my support of the American retail industry,
which is the largest employer in the private sector.
In total, 258
Senators and House members were given the award, which coincided with
National Small Business Week sponsored by the Small Business
Administration.
Award eligibility was based on key votes, bill
sponsorship and advocacy on a wide array of retail priorities.
I was
also named a recipient in 2013.

MAIN STREET TOURS
On May 5, I visited Kingston and spent time
talking to residents about issues ranging from Obamacare to government
regulation of small business.
It was great stopping by the Kingston
Fire Department and several local businesses.
The following week, I toured Millersburg and had the opportunity to
talk with locals about their legislative concerns.
After lunch at the
Wooden Nickel, I enjoyed visiting Millersburg Fire Company and several
local businesses, including Williams French Fries, Millersburg
Pharmacy, Millersburg Hardware Company, Johnson's Jewelry & Gifts, The
Furniture Center, and TVP Colonnade Theater.
On May 16, I spent the afternoon in Sunbury meeting with local
residents and learning about the issues most important to this town.
I
had lunch with the firefighters at the Americus Hose Company, where I
was humbled to become just the second person ever to receive an
honorary membership.
I also stopped by a few local establishments and
connected with small business owners to hear how I can best serve them
in Washington.
During the first week of June, I visited Boiling Springs to learn more
about the concerns of the people in this village.
I began my day with
lunch at Boiling Springs Tavern, followed by a visit to Citizen's Fire
Company #1, stops at Karns supermarket and Children's Lake, and a
lesson from Gene Giza from Four Seasons Flyfishing Guide Service.
Thank you to the local officials, firehouses, and business owners who
participate in my Main Street Tours and keep me informed on the issues
important to our district. To see more pictures and information about
my Main Street Tours, visit my F

Natural Disaster Mitigation
While I have always supported helping people rebuild following natural
disasters, I think we should place a greater emphasis on preventative
measures known as mitigation.

mitigation in the Times Leader, click here.

IMPORTANT VOTE:
On May 30, I voted for and the House passed legislation that funds the
Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well as several of the nation's
science programs (CJS) by a vote of 321 to 87.
Among other
initiatives, the bill funds programs to combat gangs and prevent
violence against women.
It also restores and increases funding for the
incarceration of illegal immigrants in local jails.
The bill contains
$51.2 billion in funding by prioritizing programs and spending and
saves more than $398 million over the enacted fiscal year 2014 level.
Although this is not a perfect piece of legislation, I supported this
measure because I believe it accomplishes a number of goals that are
very important to me and my constituents back home in the 11th District
of Pennsylvania.
The bill addresses our nation's heroin epidemic and
provides funding for regional gang task forces to fight the growth of
both the drug trade and gangs throughout Pennsylvania.
In regards to
illegal immigration, this legislation calls on the Department of
Justice to investigate the discretionary enforcement decisions of the
Department of Homeland Security and State and includes my request for
$210 million for the Criminal Alien Assistance Program which helps
local governments cover the costs of illegal immigrants who are
arrested and incarcerated in local jails and prisons.

a

It
is
a

to
honor
those
who
have
given
their

to
protect
this

In
all
of
our
armed

Americans
have
spilled
their
blood
and
given
their
lives
&#8211;
in
many
cases
on

of
people
in
foreign

they
had
never

Our
Veterans
epitomize
what
it

we

that
in
recent
weeks
we
learned
of
a
scandal
of
incredible
proportions
at
the
Department
of
Veterans

(VA).
This
is
a
veterans
health
care
system
that
is
so
inept,
corrupt,
and
broken
that
40
veterans
have
died
while
waiting
for
treatment,
and
government
officials
are
alleged
to
have
falsified
records
to
cover
up
how
long
waiting
lists
really
were.
The
recent
Inspector
General&#8217;s
report
is
yet
more
evidence
that
the
problem
is
systemic,
widespread,
and
certainly
not
limited
to
one
hospital
in
Phoenix.
Although
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
Eric
Shinseki
has
resigned,
this
is
a
problem
larger
than
just
one
man.
This
is
not
a
problem
that
is
exclusive
to
one
administration
or
one
party.
This
is
not
a
Democrat
or
Republican
problem.
This
is
an
American

And
we

the

and
its

and
I
am
eager
to
examine
each
one
on
its
own

I
will
be
looking
at
all
of
the
ideas
with
the
goal
of
making
sure
that
our
veterans
receive
the
care
they
deserve
and
were
promised.
And
I
promise
you
this:
we
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
this,
we
will
hold
people
accountable,
and
we
will
address
the
problem.
Those
who
sign
up
to

know
that

From
Washington... PASSAGE
OF
LEGISLATION
TO
BOOST
ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT
AND
AID
IN
FLOOD
RISK
PREVENTION
On
May
20,
the
House
passed
legislation
to
promote
American
competitiveness
and
economic
growth
by
maintaining
an
effective
waterway
infrastructure,
while
also
supporting
strong
flood
protection.
In
the
form
of
a
conference
report
reconciling
differences
in
House
and
Senate
versions,
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA,
H.R.
3080)
passed
the
House
of
Representatives
412
to
4.
The
legislation
originated
in
the
House
Transportation
and
Infrastructure
Committee,
where
I
am
the
Chairman
of
the
Subcommittee
on
Economic
Development,
Public
Buildings,
and
Emergency
Management.
On
June
10,
the
president
signed
this
legislation
into
law.
This
legislation
increases
the
roles
of
the
private
sector
and
local
communities,
and
it
also
creates
opportunities
for
public-private
partnerships.
Further,
WRRDA
strengthens
Congressional
oversight,
restricts
executive
overreach,
cuts
red
tape,
and
provides
transparency
in
the
selection
of
projects.
And
critically
for
our
part
of
Pennsylvania,
WRRDA
helps
with
flood
risk
management.

ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
HOUSE
SELECT
COMMITTEE
ON
THE
EVENTS
SURROUNDING
BENGHAZI
On
May
8,
the
House
passed
H.Res.
567,
legislation
that
establishes
a
House
Select
Committee
on
the
events
surrounding
the
2012
terrorist
attack
in
Benghazi
which
will
be
headed
by
Rep.
Trey
Gowdy
(GA-04).
As
an
original
co-sponsor
of
H.Res.
36,
a
measure
that
called
for
the
creation
of
a
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi
and
was
used
as
the
original
basis
for
the
most
recent
House
action
on
this
issue,
I
was
pleased
to
be
able
to
vote
in
favor
of
this
bill.
What
is
most
important
to
remember
about
the
events
in
Benghazi
of
September
11,
2012
is
that
four
Americans,
including
our
ambassador
to
Libya,
lost
their
lives.
Their
memories,
their
families,
and
the
American
people
deserve
to
know
the
truth
about
what
happened
leading
up
to
the
terrorist
attack
on
our
embassy,
the
circumstances
on
the
ground,
and
the
aftermath
and
subsequent
false
explanations.
That&#8217;s
what
this
Select
Committee
will
be
tasked
to
examine,
and
I
trust
my
colleague,
Congressman
Trey
Gowdy,
with
that
important
responsibility.
People
want
answers.
Why
were
repeated
requests
for
more
security
ignored?
What
was
the
immediate
reaction
from
the
White
House
on
that
fateful
night?
And
who
decided
to
spin
a
bogus
political
story
to
explain
the
attacks,
blame
an
obscure
Internet
video,
and
for
what
purpose?
There
are
some
who
insist
that
Benghazi
is
yesterday&#8217;s
news,
but
that
fails
to
explain
why
relevant
documents
have
been
selectively
released
gradually
and
heavily
redacted,
or
sometimes
not
at
all.
Recent
threats
of
boycotting
the
proceedings
indicate
a
fear
of
a
full
examination,
serve
only
to
further
politicize
the
search
for
the
truth,
and
provide
cover
to
those
who
want
to
wish
the
whole
tragic
episode
away.
This
committee
will
seek
the
truth,
but
it
will
also
look
forward
in
an
effort
to
make
sure
something
like
this
never
happens
again.
OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION
RELEASES
MORE
THAN
36,000
ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS
It
was
recently
revealed
that
last
year
the
Obama
Administration
released
more
than
36,000
illegal
immigrants
held
by
the
U.S.
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
Agency
(ICE).
Some
of
those
released
had
been
convicted
of
serious
violent
crimes.
Among
the
freed
prisoners,
who
previously
had
been
in
deportment
proceedings,
were
116
who
had
been
convicted
of
homicide,
43
who
were
convicted
of
voluntary
manslaughter,
and
one
who
was
convicted
of
a
crime
classified
by
ICE
as
&#8220;homicide-willful
kill-public
official-gun.&#8221;
This
should
put
to
rest
any
belief
that
the
Obama
Administration
is
taking
illegal
immigration
seriously,
and
also
throw
cold
water
on
any
talk
about
an
immigration
reform
bill
that
even
remotely
resembles
amnesty.
Our
borders
are
not
secure,
our
immigration
laws
are
being
ignored,
and
violent
criminals
are
being
set
free
to
roam
the
streets.
This
should
be
a
wakeup
call
for
anyone
who
cares
about
the
rule
of
law,
and
a
clear
signal
that
no
one
should
consider
amnesty
for
illegal
immigrants
already
present
in
this
country
&#8211;
particularly
while
this
administration
is
in
office.
Aside
from
being
a
public
safety
concern,
this
is
also
an
economic
issue.
If
we
dangle
the
prize
of
amnesty
for
those
who
have
already
broken
our
laws,
it
will
inevitably
encourage
millions
more
to
cross
our
borders
illegally.
There
are
hard
working
citizens
who
are
legally
present
finding
it
difficult
to
find
work,
and
the
last
thing
we
should
do
is
to
open
the
gates
to
more
competition
for
already
scarce
jobs.
I
encourage
all
of
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
digest
this
news
and
stand
firmly
against
any
legislation
that
contains
or
leads
to
amnesty.

I
have
been
recognized
as
a

Main
Street&#8221;
by
the
National
Retail

(NRF)
for

In

258
Senators

House
members
were
given
the
award,
which
coincided
with
National
Small

sponsored
by
the

Award
eligibility
was
based

MAIN
STREET
TOURS
On
May
5,
I
visited
Kingston
and
spent
time
talking
to
residents
about
issues
ranging
from
Obamacare
to
government
regulation
of
small
business.
It
was
great
stopping
by
the
Kingston
Fire
Department
and
several
local
businesses.
The
following
week,
I
toured
Millersburg
and
had
the
opportunity
to
talk
with
locals
about
their
legislative
concerns.
After
lunch
at
the
Wooden
Nickel,
I
enjoyed
visiting
Millersburg
Fire
Company
and
several
local
businesses,
including
Williams
French
Fries,
Millersburg
Pharmacy,
Millersburg
Hardware
Company,
Johnson&#8217;s
Jewelry
&amp;
Gifts,
The
Furniture
Center,
and
TVP
Colonnade
Theater.
On
May
16,
I
spent
the
afternoon
in
Sunbury
meeting
with
local
residents
and
learning
about
the
issues
most
important
to
this
town.
I
had
lunch
with
the
firefighters
at
the
Americus
Hose
Company,
where
I
was
humbled
to
become
just
the
second
person
ever
to
receive
an
honorary
membership.
I
also
stopped
by
a
few
local
establishments
and
connected
with
small
business
owners
to
hear
how
I
can
best
serve
them
in
Washington.
During
the
first
week
of
June,
I
visited
Boiling
Springs
to
learn
more
about
the
concerns
of
the
people
in
this
village.
I
began
my
day
with
lunch
at
Boiling
Springs
Tavern,
followed
by
a
visit
to
Citizen's
Fire
Company
#1 ,
stops
at
Karns
supermarket
and
Children's
Lake,
and
a
lesson
from
Gene
Giza
from
Four
Seasons
Flyfishing
Guide
Service.
Thank
you
to
the
local
officials,
firehouses,
and
business
owners
who
participate
in

me

on
the
issues
important
to
our

Natural
Disaster
Mitigation
While
I
have
always
supported
helping
people
rebuild
following
natural
disasters,
I
think
we
should
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
preventative
measures
known
as
mitigation.

IMPORTANT
VOTE:
On
May
30,
I
voted
for
and
the
House
passed
legislation
that
funds
the
Departments
of
Commerce
and
Justice,
as
well
as
several
of
the
nation&#8217;s
science
programs
(CJS)
by
a
vote
of
321
to
87.
Among
other
initiatives,
the
bill
funds
programs
to
combat
gangs
and
prevent
violence
against
women.
It
also
restores
and
increases
funding
for
the
incarceration
of
illegal
immigrants
in
local
jails.
The
bill
contains
$51.2
billion
in
funding
by
prioritizing
programs
and
spending
and
saves
more
than
$398
million
over
the
enacted
fiscal
year
2014
level.
Although
this
is
not
a
perfect
piece
of
legislation,
I
supported
this
measure
because
I
believe
it
accomplishes
a
number
of
goals
that
are
very
important
to
me
and
my
constituents
back
home
in
the
11th
District
of
Pennsylvania.
The
bill
addresses
our
nation&#8217;s
heroin
epidemic
and
provides
funding
for
regional
gang
task
forces
to
fight
the
growth
of
both
the
drug
trade
and
gangs
throughout
Pennsylvania.
In
regards
to
illegal
immigration,
this
legislation
calls
on
the
Department
of
Justice
to
investigate
the
discretionary
enforcement
decisions
of
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
and
State
and
includes
my
request
for
$210
million
for
the
Criminal
Alien
Assistance
Program
which
helps
local
governments
cover
the
costs
of
illegal
immigrants
who
are
arrested
and
incarcerated
in
local
jails
and
prisons.
