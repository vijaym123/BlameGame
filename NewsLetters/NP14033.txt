Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Monday, I had the privilege of touring Nemours Childrens Hospital in Orlando to meet the dedicated staff, doctors, and medical professionals who are working tirelessly to serve the needs of children facing difficult medical situations. Built to fulfill the requests and recommendations of both patients and families, Nemours Childrens Hospital is owned by Nemours, a non-profit childrens health organization that is seeking to achieve medical and technological advancements through extensive research and caring concern to meet individual patient needs.

On Friday morning, it was my honor to speak at the Inaugural Leadership Prayer Breakfast of Lake County. Elected officials, business leaders, and community members gathered from all over Lake County to focus on the power of prayer. John Rivers, owner of 4 Rivers Smokehouse, shared his story of stepping out in faith to enter the restaurant industry, and how God has blessed his family and business. It was a pleasure to join Lake County for this inaugural event.

Earlier this year, iStorage moved their corporate headquarters from California and settled in downtown Winter Garden. With over 40,000 storage units in the United States, iStorage has created jobs for hundreds of employees in the last few years. It was a pleasure meeting Chris Miller and the rest of the leadership team this week, and discussing some of the fiscal issues that are currently facing our country.

On Friday, I also had the opportunity to join the West Orange Neighborhood Center for Families Annual Open House to celebrate the work they are doing for the community. Many of the organizations, agencies, and local government officials that work with the West Orange Neighborhood Center for Families attended the event, and I had the pleasure of thanking them for their dedicated service and coordinated efforts to assist local families and individuals in need.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Earlier this year, a constituent from Orlando electronically filed their 2012 income tax forms, only to discover that they had become the victim of identity theft. After consulting with the IRS, the constituent was informed that the issue would more than likely not get resolved until 2014. The constituent called my office to see if we might be able to assist her. We submitted a Congressional inquiry to the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) with a copy of their Identity Theft Affidavit, and within a matter of weeks, the problem was resolved and the appropriate refund was issued.
Share Your View:
Last week, TIME magazine published an article that foreshadows the next possible broken promise about Obamacare
whether you can actually keep your doctor. In You Can Keep Your Doctor: Obamacares Next Broken Promise?, the article quotes President Obama in 2009, when he stated, No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise: if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period.
Are you concerned that additional problems will continue to emerge from Obamacare, including the potential of not being able to keep your doctor?

Legislative Update:
Recently, I was appointed as a member of the conference committee to assist in reconciling the differences between the House and Senate versions of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA). This legislation is very important to Florida and is proof that Congress is able to carefully review and agree on important legislation if they follow the prescribed process of regular order.
Both versions of the bill have strong bipartisan support and eliminate old projects that are no longer important, clearing the way for updated reforms. The House version also includes necessary limitations on the authority that the Administration possesses over infrastructure decision-making. We had our first conference meeting this week, and I look forward to crafting a final piece of legislation that will create jobs and build a solid groundwork to support further economic growth.
