Friend,
I&#39;m not kidding. As we speak, John Boehner is packing his bags and preparing to come to Sacramento in an attempt to help Doug Ose buy this seat.
We can&#39;t let that happen. We need your immediate help.
Click here and give $5 or $10 right now.
Boehner is counting on Ose to join him in Congress and be another guaranteed vote in his pocket. He knows Ose will be at his beck and call - that&#39;s why he&#39;s flying clear across the country to campaign for him.
And frankly, Boehner is a huge draw - with his presence comes a LOT of money.
We CANNOT afford to be outraised right now.
We have to fight back immediately. Click here and give.
Thanks.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
