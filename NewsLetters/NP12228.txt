Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
During this Presidents Day week, it was great to be home in the district hearing from students, educators, business leaders, and members of our community. On Tuesday, I met with Clark and Justin Gey, who operate Wayne Automatic Fire Sprinklers from their headquarters in Ocoee. As the second and third generation owners, it was helpful to hear from Clark and Justin about the status of their business and how Wayne Automatic is recovering from the economic downturn and once again hiring and expanding.

Every year, Congressional offices around the country offer an art competition for high school students in their district. The winner of this competition is flown to Washington, D.C., to see where their artwork will hang in the gallery between the House office buildings and the Capitol for the following year. The theme for my offices Congressional Art Competition this year is The Natural Beauty of America. Inspiration for this theme is taken from the patriotic song,
America the Beautiful.
In order to ensure that the art teachers and students are aware of this opportunity, I visited several high schools in my district this week to provide a packet of information regarding the details and participation guidelines. At several of the schools, I also had an opportunity to speak to the government, economics, history, and leadership classes to share different aspects of my job in Washington and encourage our next generation to become leaders.
The schools I spoke at this week included:
- Foundation Academy in Winter Garden
- Discovery Academy in Lake Alfred
- Auburndale High School
- Winter Haven High School
- Ridge Community High School in Davenport
- Leesburg High School
- West Orange High School
- Humanities and Fine Arts Charter School in Leesburg
On Thursday, I also had the privilege of informing Logan Dyer, his family and teachers from West Orange High School about his appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Later that day, I received word that Destin Fleming from Mount Dora had also been accepted to the Naval Academy. In both the Service Academy nominations and Congressional Art Competition, it is an honor to encourage and inspire the next generation of leaders to cultivate their talents and pursue their dreams. More information about both the Service Academy nomination process and Congressional Art Competition can found
on my website .

Following the education theme this week, I participated in the Instillation Ceremony for the new President of Beacon College, Dr. George Hagerty. As a small, private college based in Leesburg, Beacon College is dedicated to the advancement and success of young people with learning disabilities. I had the opportunity to join students, teachers, administrators, and local leaders in recognizing Dr. Hagerty as the new president, and supporting his vision to assist students in achieving their goals.

On Friday, I joined the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Mark Welsh, as well as other high-ranking generals and local military leaders at the Air Force Associations Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando. At the Technology Expo, I saw samples of the innovative methods of safety and security that the Air Force is exploring, and experienced the simulation of new, advanced technology designed to keep our country strong and safe.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Winter Haven contacted my office regarding a delay in obtaining a passport for her upcoming cruise. After several weeks without a response from the Passport Agency, she asked my office to check on the status of her requested passport. We reached out to the Passport Agency and they informed us that they were still waiting for her to send some necessary documentation. The constituent was able to locate the documents, send them to the Passport Agency, and subsequently receive her passport without any further delay.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Recently, I co-sponsored the Jobs Originated through Launching Travel (JOLT) Act, which contains reforms that if instituted will have a direct, positive impact on Central Floridas economy. Nearly 4 million international tourists visit the Orlando area each year supporting more than 200,000 tourism-related Central Florida jobs, and the JOLT Act streamlines the travel process to cut down on some of the current bureaucratic hurdles facing prospective visitors. A key aspect of the legislation modernizes the visa program to allow tourists from closely allied countries to proceed directly to security screening, thereby easing travel restrictions, and opening the doors to the incredible impact that they have on our tourism industry.
This week, the U.S. Travel Association sent out a press release recognizing my support of the JOLT Act. You can view
