Dear Friend,
During this truly special time of year, I am so grateful for the
opportunity to spend time with my family. Today marks not only our
newest baby daughter's first Christmas, but the first Christmas since I
took the solemn and humbling oath on January 3 to represent the people
of Kentucky's Sixth District to the best of my ability in the U.S.
House of Representatives.
As we celebrate, I hope you will join me in taking a moment to remember
the true Christmas spirit and be mindful of those who are suffering, in
need or apart from family and friends. My family and I especially think
of those American heroes who are separated from their own families as
they protect our freedoms overseas.
I remain honored to serve you and your neighbors, and as always, my
office is here to help. Please never hesitate to contact us if there is
any way we can be of assistance
.
>From my family to yours, Merry Christmas and best wishes for a
prosperous, healthy, and blessed New Year.
Sincerely,
Andy Barr
Member of Congress

3

I

are
separated
from

they
protect
our
freedoms
overseas.
I
remain
honored
to
