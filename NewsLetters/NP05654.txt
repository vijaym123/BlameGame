Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Yesterday, the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the bans on same-sex marriage in
Nevada violated the constitution and cannot be enforced, adding to a
growing list of states where same-sex unions are now legal. This decision
puts Nevada on the side of equality and the right side of history. Our
state and our country are strengthened by our diversity. No longer will
gay and lesbian Nevadans be told that their committed relationships
are less than those of straight couples. With the Ninth Circuits
decision, gay and lesbian Nevadans will soon be able to enjoy full
recognition, respect and protection of their right to love. I want to commend
the hard work of advocates at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, Freedom Nevada and others throughout the country who were able to
make this day a reality for thousands of gay and lesbian
Nevadans.
As we move forward in Nevada, let us also continue to work to
ensure the same rights are extended in the states that still deny gay
and lesbian couples this right. We have much work to do to achieve
this goal.
