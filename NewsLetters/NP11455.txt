Dear Constituents,
On January 17th Governor
Brown proclaimed a
statewide drought emergency
and
asked all Californians to reduce their water consumption by 20
percent this year.
The drought in California is unprecedented.
2013 was the driest year in our states history and 2014 is predicted to
have similar conditions. In our congressional district, the town of
Lompico has been teetering on the brink of having no water at all, with
just 100 days of drinking water left as of late January. The drought
affects everyone from urban and rural communities, to farmers,
fishermen, sportsmen, and large and small businesses. Without this precious
natural resource, our economy, environment, and health are all at
risk.
This severe water scarcity requires each of us to take
measures to preserve the water we have, and its why Im providing you
with some helpful conservation tips from the Association of California
Water Agencies (ACWA). For a more comprehensive set of tips on how you
can preserve water in and around your home you can also visit
SaveOurH2O.org , a public awareness campaign about the
drought sponsored by ACWA and the California Department of Water
Resources.
Here are 14 ways you can conserve water on a
daily basis both indoors and
out:
Indoors
Use washing machines for
full loads only.
Run the dishwasher only when
full.
When washing dishes by hand, dont let the water run. Fill
one basin with wash water and the other with rinse
water.
Install an aerator on your kitchen faucet to reduce flow to less than
1 gallon per minute.
Use the garbage disposal
sparingly. Alternatively, you can compost vegetable food waste and save
gallons of water every time.
Install low-flow shower
heads.
Take a five minute shower instead of a 10 minute
one.
Turn your bathroom faucet off when brushing your teeth or
shaving.
Outdoors
Water early in the morning or later in the evening when
temperatures are cooler.
Adjust your sprinklers to
ensure only your yard is being watered, not your house, sidewalk or
street.
Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants to
reduce evaporation and keep the soil cool.
Landscape your
yard with climate appropriate plants.
Use a broom instead
of a hose to clean driveways, sidewalks and
patios.
Wash vehicles with a bucket and sponge, and make sure your hose has a
self-closing nozzle.
The small steps we take at home
add up and can make a huge difference for our state.
I will
practice what I preach in my own home. I will also advocate sound
policies in Congress that preserve water resources. This week I joined
several colleagues in introducing new drought relief legislation that
would authorize $473 million to assist drought-impacted communities.
The legislation would provide immediate assistance to towns facing
water shortages, like Lompico, and it would also invest in long-term
solutions like water conservation and recycling projects. Importantly, the
bill does not pit California water users against one another, or favor
one interest group above the greater good.
The bottom line
is that were in this together and we can take actions and make
choices about water conservation that will make an important
difference.
If you have any tips to share with me, let me know. I welcome
your insightful thoughts and commentary.
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member of
Congress
