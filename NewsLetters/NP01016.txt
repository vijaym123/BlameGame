Dear
Friends,
I have an exciting role this year as vice chairman of the newly
formed Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations.
On Wednesday, the subcommittee held a hearing titled, Zero
Accountability: The Consequences of Politically Driven Science. We
heard troubling testimony about what happens when government manipulates
science to get the result it wants.
One outrageous case
involves an 80-year-old oyster farm in California which the National
Park Service shut down in December, killing 30 jobs.
I had the
chance to question Kevin Lunny, who owned Drakes Bay Oyster Company.
His family has raised cattle in what is now the Point Reyes National
Seashore since 1946.
Lunny told the committee how the full
weight of the federal government moved to put him out of business so
the area could be designated as wilderness. Parks officials were
cheered on by environmental purists who didnt seem to care that oysters
have been harvested there for over 1,000 years.
We felt
helpless, bullied and ignored, Lunny testified.
To the Park
Service, facts didnt matter. They used a 70 horsepower Jet Ski to
represent the noise of a 20 horsepower boat and a jackhammer to replicate a
handheld pneumatic tool. They claimed the farm was responsible for an
80 percent decline in one harbor seal colony, when, in fact, the seals
had simply relocated
closer to the farm!
The Park
Service took 250,000 photographs during three years of pupping season, but
when the pictures showed no evidence the farm hurt seals they concealed
the record.
California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein
wrote that Park Service scientists behaved as advocates, falsifying and
misrepresenting data in their quest to deep-six the
farm.
Still, the Park Service converted the area to wilderness. An
estuary that produced oysters for the Miwok tribe for centuries, and for
modern markets since 1935, is off limits.
Now the Park
Service is turning its attention to ranches at Point Reyes, despite the
fact Congress established the National Seashore in part to protect
agricultural uses dating to the California Gold Rush.
We are
terrified, Lunny told me during the hearing.
One of my
favorite quotes captures the big picture of this shocking story: When
government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the
government, there is tyranny.
Holding the executive branch
accountable is a vital responsibility of Congress. Im glad to be on the
forefront of the Resources Committees efforts to root out government
intimidation, malfeasance and waste.
