Rep. Miller: VA Negligence Disgraceful
Rep. Candice Miller votes for legislation that improves accountability for VA&#8217;s mismanagement and negligence hurting our veterans
Washington &#8211;
U.S. Representative Candice
Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after voting for the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031):
&quot;As our nation prepares to solemnly honor the brave Americans this Memorial Day weekend who made the ultimate sacrifice
in defense of freedom, we must also remember that we have a duty to honor the fellow soldiers of the fallen who have also served our nation with great distinction &#8211; our veterans.
The brave men and women who have worn our uniform have never failed to answer
freedom&#8217;s call. Unfortunately, over recent weeks, we have seen that the Department of Veterans Affairs has failed in its mission to provide them the care they need, deserve and have earned.
This failure is disgraceful and unacceptable.
&#8220;It is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that our veterans receive proper and timely care, and bureaucratic mismanagement
cannot stand in the way of that mission.
This week, the House took an important first step by passing legislation that would increase accountability for the senior executives within the Veterans Affairs Department who are found responsible for the systemic
failures and mismanagement within the department that has failed so many veterans across the country.
Although an important first step, more must be done, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to fight for our vets and ensure they get the care they
need.
They have more than earned it.&#8221;
The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031)
gives the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs authority to remove employees of the Senior Executive Service, whose performance the Secretary believes warrants removal, from the government service completely or transfer
them to a General Schedule position within the current civil service system. The bill would also require the VA Secretary to give the Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees notice of removal within 30 days of removing an individual.
