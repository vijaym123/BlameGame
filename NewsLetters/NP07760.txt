The Scalise Capitol
Report

Congressman Scalise deliver the weekly GOP address
Today, I
had the opportunity to deliver the weekly Republican address to our
nation about the value of hard work. Standing in the Old House Chamber
inside of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., I shared what House
Republicans are doing to build a stronger economy and a better
future.
The Old House Chamber is
certainly a long way from Jefferson, Louisiana, which is where my wife
Jennifer and I are raising our two young children, Madison and Harrison.
Were proud to raise them in the land of opportunity, because only in
America, can the great-grandson of an Italian immigrant who came to
the United States as an indentured servant, work hard and be elected by
his colleagues to serve as the Majority Whip of the House of
Representatives. Because of my great-grandparents sacrifices, I was born into
a middle-class family in New Orleans.
Growing up, I learned the value of hard work. I
worked at Home Depot to help pay my way through Louisiana State
University, where I became the first in my family to graduate college. From an
early age, I was taught to work hard, play by the rules and never give
up. Its what makes America the greatest country on Earth. When
Americans work hard and work together, theres nothing we cant
accomplish.
Heres an example.
If you look at the regions in the country with the lowest unemployment
rates, many have energy-based economies. Im proud to represent one
of them -- the Houma-Thibodaux area, which boasts a 3.7 percent
unemployment rate. Here in Southeast Louisiana, someone can graduate high
school and get an entry-level job making over $60,000 a year producing
American energy. American energy brings billions into our economy,
increases our nations energy security, and helps lower gas prices at the
pump. And we know energy is the best way to jumpstart our
economy.
But Democrats running
Washington dont seem to get it.
They block bill after bill that would put hard working Americans back
to work. House Republicans continue to pass bipartisan legislation to
expand energy production, lower gas prices, and create
jobs.
As a matter of fact, there are
nearly 300 house-passed bills collecting dust in the Senate today
more
than 40 of them that are specifically focused on creating jobs.
These include popular bipartisan projects like the Keystone XL pipeline
something the Presidents own administration says will create over
40,000 jobs.
Washington
Democrats have said no to legislation to rein in the size of government,
no to fix our broken tax code, and no to lower health care cost because
theyd rather spend money we dont have on policies we know wont
work. Every time they say no, they hold our economy hostage.
And
with it, our chance to make sure our kids will have that same shot at
the American Dream.
The
president likes to say he can make things happen with a pen and a phone.
Im calling on him to put down the pen and stop trying to rewrite laws
he doesnt like, and instead pick up the phone and call on Senate
Democrats to get to work passing those good bipartisan jobs bills. Its
time to stop politics as
usual.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress.
