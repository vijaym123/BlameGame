CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
June 20, 2014
Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about the growing
threat in the Middle East.
I understand that our nation is weary
of war.
I respect the sacrifices made by our service members and
I work every day to ensure that our brave men and women, our veterans,
are provided the care and treatment they deserve.
Their efforts
should not be in vain. Our service members served and sacrificed
overseas so we could be safe at home.
We cannot in good faith let
the Administration dishonor their efforts with a misguided policy.
The continued draw down of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan
will provide Al Qaeda, the Taliban and the Haqqani network with a safe
haven to train operatives and plot further attacks against the United
States of America and our allies.
Contrary to the campaign
statement of the President and Vice President, Al Qaeda is not on the run.
I urge this Administration to avoid further actions that may
endanger our nation.

On Thursday, Senators Kaine, Blumenthal, and I
introduced a resolution to recognize Veterans Day, November 11, 2014, as a
special Welcome Home commemoration for all who have served in the
military since Congress passed the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military
Force.
Every November 11 th , as a nation, we take time
to honor our veterans and reflect upon their service.
These men
and women selflessly give of themselves to defend our freedoms, and we
are constantly humbled by their strength and courage.
This year
we would like to recognize our veterans who have served post 9/11 in a
special Welcome Home tribute.
It is my hope that the Senate
will swiftly pass this bipartisan resolution so communities around our
great nation can plan events for our post 9/11 warriors.

This week, I released a statement on two recent VA Inspector
General reports
one from June 6 th
and another from June
10 th .
The June 6 th
report outlined the results
of the IG's audit of VBA's use of temporary 100% disability
ratings.
The June 10 th
report outlines the results of a routine
inspection of the regional office in Reno, Nevada.
These reports are an indicator of an alarming practice at the
Veterans Benefits Administration -- make a few statistics look better
but ignore overall service to veterans.
Weve been raising the
alarm for a while that the VA has been allowing work that isnt included
in VA's narrow backlog statistic to pile up, including appeals and
award adjustments that can impact a veterans bottom line and overall
care.
But, these reports suggest that the scope of work the VA
has been ignoring may be even greater, including training, quality
assurance measures, and steps to ensure program integrity. So, is the drop
in the VAs backlog all just smoke and mirrors? To read more about
each of these reports,

Finally, this week the House and Senate have named their respective
conference members for the VA legislation. Conference members from the Senate
include Senators Sanders, McCain, Coburn, Isakson, Johanns, Rubio,
Begich, Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono, Murray, Rockefeller, Tester, and
myself.
Representing the House will be Representatives Miller,
Lamborn, Roe, Flores, Benishek, Coffman, Wenstrup, Walorski, Michaud, Brown,
Takano, Brownley, Kirkpatrick, and Walz.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
