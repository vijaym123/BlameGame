President's
Healthcare Law Continues to Harm Working
Families
Dear Friend,
It seems as though every time we turn
around, President Obama is issuing
decisions to unilaterally amend another one
of the endless mandates within his
signature legislation imposed on the
American people. This past week, the Obama
Administration announced that the millions
of Americans who had their health plans
cancelled because of the presidents
health care law would be able to keep their
plans and be exempt from penalties until
after the 2016 elections. This
politically-driven attempt by the
Administration to delay the harmful impacts
of the law is further proof that the
president knows that it's simply not
working and that the massive failings of
the law will have severe repercussions for
Americans and their families.
At least 4.7 million individual health
policies have been cancelled due to the
regulations associated with the
presidents health care law. However,
it has not yet been determined whether or
not policyholders will be relieved
financially if they are permitted to keep
their plans because insurance companies
have indicated that they will have to raise
prices nonetheless.
As the Obama Administration announced
these changes, the House of Representatives
was approving legislation to bring American
families relief from the harmful law by
passing the Simple Fairness Act, which
eliminates the individual mandate penalty
for a year. The Obama Administration
recently announced another one-year delay
of the employer mandate for small and
mid-sized businesses, and this legislation
grants hardworking American families the
same relief from the Affordable Care Act's
unprecedented mandates. I was pleased that
a number of my Democratic colleagues in the
House supported this legislation, as well,
to provide common sense relief for
Americans from the failings of the
presidents health care law and hope
that the U.S. Senate will act quickly to
pass this bill.
The bottom line is that millions of
Americans are losing their health
insurance, being subjected to an unsecure
online marketplace system, and paying
higher premiums and deductibles under the
presidents health care law. I stand
committed to continuing to fight to repeal
this harmful law, and I look forward to
working with my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to promote more positive health
care reforms.
