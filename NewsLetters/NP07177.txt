Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
I have a full schedule set for the upcoming district work period, and was happy to kick it off by dropping by Doggibags Boutique and Monogramming Service in Leesburg. Dell Ross, the owner who was named Citizen of the Year by the Leesburg Partnership last year, is affectionately known by her fellow local business owners as the Mother of Main Street. After giving me a gracious and warm welcome, sharing the history of her business and providing a tour of her studio, Dell introduced me to several other business owners whom she invited to her shop in anticipation of my visit.

Visiting community groups and service organizations is one of the highlights of my time in the district. Local residents are the ones who know their communitys needs best, and there is no way that the federal government can stamp out a universal, one-size-fits-all program that will adequately serve the diverse communities throughout our state and nation. This week, I visited several groups to thank them for their service, hear their thoughts and concerns, share an update on what is happening in Washington, and answer questions relating to the issues with which they are most concerned.
Some of the groups I had the privilege of visiting with this week included:
-	Leesburg Noon Kiwanis
-	West Orange Chamber of Commerce Wednesday Networking Group
-	Farm Credit and Florida Nursery, Growers and Landscaping Association as the keynote speaker at their annual awards luncheon
-	Kiwanis Club of South Lake at Cheesers Cafe
-	South Lake Business Leaders at their meeting in Clermont

All around the country, communities participated in the 31st National Night Out Against Crime. On Tuesday, I was privileged to join Chief Charles Broadway and Sheriff Gary Borders, along with local officials and community members at the Clermont National Night Out. Following that, I stopped by the Independence Celebration of National Night Out to thank our local law enforcement and join the West Orange community in Independence to honor these men and women who fight crime and keep our neighborhoods safe.

Quality and affordable health care remains a big concern to businesses, families, and individuals in our area. This week, I visited the Community Health Center in Leesburg to meet some of the patients and listen to doctors and administrators share their perspective as they serve member of the community needing care.
This week, I also had the opportunity to visit the Vantage Oncology-Inter Community Cancer Center in Leesburg and new UFHealth Cancer Center in Ocoee.
For more pictures and information on these and additional visits that I made in the district this week, you can follow me on Twitter

Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Winter Haven contacted my office on behalf of his son, who was confused over the status of his immigrant visa at the Embassy in Haiti.
After submitting a Congressional Inquiry, the Embassy informed us that the constituents son was eligible to come to the Embassy and provide the updated information they required. My office relayed this information to the constituent and continued to monitor the situation and verify that everything had gone smoothly. Shortly after the necessary documentation had been submitted, we received notice that the visa they requested had been issued.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Before arriving back in Orlando for the August district work period, I voted to secure the southwest border and address the humanitarian crisis that has been inflamed by the Presidents own misguided policies encouraging unlawful immigration.
The legislation the House passed late last week allows for the States to deploy the National Guard to immediately assist in securing our Southwest border, amends existing law to discourage additional unlawful crossings, provides for additional judges to expedite proceedings necessary to send unaccompanied minors back to their families in their home country and funds emergency care for the children trapped in this humanitarian crisis. In short, this package supplies the critical resources to provide necessary humanitarian aid now and prevent additional, and avoidable, crises in the future.
The border legislation package amends 2008 law to ensure all unaccompanied minors receive a prompt hearing; prohibits the Administration from restricting Border Patrol access to federal lands along the Southwest border; prohibits drug dealers from claiming asylum; prohibits any additional executive actions unilaterally suspending enforcement of immigration laws; provides necessary funding to deploy the National Guard to the Southwest border to assist Border Patrol, for additional judges to expedite adjudication cases, strengthen border security efforts; and expedites the return of arriving individuals to their home countries, and ensures necessary detention spaces while these individuals are awaiting processing.
Funding for these measures will be offset through spending reductions, including foreign aid to countries of
origin, and will only cover necessary expenditures through the end of this fiscal year on September 30, 2014.
Regrettably, this legislative response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis on our border remains stalled in the Senate because Harry Reid refused to bring it up for a vote before Senators left town for their August district work period.
