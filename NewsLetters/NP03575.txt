Supporting the Keystone
Pipeline
1/9/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted in favor
or H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. The bill passed by a
bipartisan vote of 266 to 153 and heads to the Senate for consideration early
next week.
The
Keystone XL pipeline has been pending for more than six years and it is
long past time to begin this project that is supported by the
majority of Americans. The delay threatens job creation, economic growth, and
our relationship with Canada, our closest ally and trading
partner.
The Keystone XL pipeline will provide significant economic and
national security benefits for the country. By bringing an extra 830,000
barrels of oil per day to U.S. refineries, the pipeline would create
American jobs and enhance our national security by reducing U.S.
reliance on energy resources from less stable regions. Continued volatility
in those regions only reinforces the urgent need to tap into new
energy sources and the Keystone XL pipeline is a safe, secure way to ensure
the nations long-term energy
security.
During the projects
construction, the Keystone XL pipeline would support more than 42,000
jobs across the country, translating to $2 billion in earnings for
workers and contribute approximately $3.4 billion to the U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP). Additionally, many state and local governments will
see the benefit of significant tax revenues as a result of the increased
economic activity. Following the projects completion, the Keystone
XL pipeline operations will continue to employ American workers and
most counties will see property tax revenue increase of 10 percent
directly benefiting local
communities.
I look forward to the new
leadership in the Senate considering this bill and sending it to President
Obama's desk for his decision. For six years the President has made
excuses to avoid supporting this legislation. With today's decision by
the Nebraska court system removing barriers to construction of the
pipeline, the President has no more
excuses.
