Holiday Mail for Heroes
Dear Friend:
Yesterday was Veterans Day, a time set aside each year to reflect on what the actions of our nations veterans mean to us. It is a time of gratitude; to say thank you to those brave men and women and their families for their courageous service and countless sacrifices.
With the holidays upon us, I hope that you will join me in sharing the spirit of the season with our service members, veterans, and their families by participating in the
Holiday Mail for Heroes
program.
Now in its seventh year, the Holiday Mail for Heroes program is an extension of the Red Cross work with more than 2 million services members and 24 million veterans each year. It provides a "touch of home" for veterans, military families and active duty service members in hospitals, military installations and other locations around the world.
My office is once again facilitating the Holiday Mail for Heroes operation by accepting cards meant for the troops and their families at my constituent service offices in Kalamazoo (157 South Kalamazoo Mall, Suite 180, Kalamazoo, MI 49007) and the Twin Cities (800 Centre, 800 Ship Street, St. Joseph, MI 49085).
Cards dropped off at the offices by December 4 will be forwarded to the Holiday Mail for Heroes program. Cards can be mailed to my offices or dropped off in person.
The American Red Cross has asked card senders keep in mind a few guidelines:
DO:
- Include a heartfelt message and signature
- Use generic salutations such as Dear Service Member
- Bundle large quantities of cards in large mailing envelopes or flat rate postal shipping boxes. Envelopes are not necessary for the cards
DO NOT:
- Send letters, packages or monetary gifts
only cards are accepted
- Include personal information such as home or email addresses on the cards
- Include inserts of any kind
these items will be removed during the reviewing process
- Use cards with glitter or use loose glitter
it can aggravate health issues of ill and injured service members
Holiday cards can also been sent directly to the program: Holiday Mail for Heroes, P.O. Box 5456, Capitol Heights, MD 20791-5456. Cards must arrive by December 6.

It is such a simple thing to sign a card to let our troops and veterans know we appreciate their work. And yet it means so much. I hope everyone will take a moment to participate in this program.
Thank you and God bless,
