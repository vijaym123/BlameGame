Lummis Holds Lerner in Contempt
Dear Friends,
I and my colleagues on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted on Thursday to hold former Director of Tax Exempt Organizations at the Internal Revenue Service Lois Lerner in contempt for refusing to answer questions related to the investigation of the IRS. We have been advised by House counsel that Ms. Lerner waived her 5th amendment rights by first telling her side of the story and proclaiming her innocence, then immediately pleading the 5th
to avoid answering questions from committee members.
It doesnt work like that.
The power to tax is the power to destroy.
And I believe Lois Lerner abused that power by stifling conservative Americans 1st amendment right of free speech.
Ms. Lerner said I have done nothing wrong, I have broken no laws.
But I believe that is a falsehood as shown in her own emails.
The Oversight Committee will continue fighting to find the truth and to that end we need answers from Lois Lerner.
Lerners actions while employed at the IRS and her refusal to answer questions are truly contemptible, and I appreciate the committees decision to hold her in that contempt.
I look forward to hearing your
thoughts and concerns
on this and whatever matter you are concerned with.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
