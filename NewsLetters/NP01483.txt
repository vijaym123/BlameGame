WEEK IN
REVIEW
This week, I was excited to honor John Paul
Hammerschmidt's life and legacy by
announcing that
Andrew Haught, a member of the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith
(UAFS) class of 2017, will serve as the as the
2015 John Paul Hammerschmidt (JPH)
Fellow .
The JPH Fellowship
was established in 2013 in conjunction with UAFS and is named for former
Arkansas Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt (1967-1993), who
passed away on April 1, 2015.
It is geared towards highly motivated
college students with an interest in public service and will allow
outstanding Third District students to experience the legislative process
firsthand in Congressman Womacks Washington, D.C. office.
On Monday, I gave a one-minute speech on the
House floor to acknowledge the outstanding work of Dr. Merlin Augustine
and his wife, Beverly, of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and the event his
foundation has sponsored for 22 yearsthe annual Easter Feed, which a
served a record 6,741 people this year.

On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 650 ,
the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015, by a vote of
263-162. ( Roll Call
#151 ) H.R. 650 allows the first mortgage on a
homeowners principal home to not be considered high cost if the mortgage
annual percentage rate (APR) at the time of consummation of the loan
does not exceed 10 percent of the average prime offer rate, the
transaction does not exceed $75,000, and the mortgage points and fees paid
to the mortgage originator do not exceed 5 percent of the transaction
or $3,000. The bill will allow consumers of small-balance residential
loans to have increased access to mortgage credit and ensure the
availability of financing options for manufactured homes, while
preserving necessary consumer protections in the Dodd-Frank Act and the
S.A.F.E. Act.
In addition, the House passed
H.R. 685 , the Mortgage Choice Act
of 2015, by a vote of 286-140. ( Roll Call #152 ) H.R. 685 amends the Truth
in Lending Act to exclude insurance held in escrow and, under
certain circumstances, fees paid to companies affiliated with the
creditor from the costs that are considered when calculating the points and
fees used when determining if a mortgage can be classified as a
Qualified Mortgage (QM). H.R. 685 also directs the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue final regulations to carry out the
provisions
in
this bill within 90 days of the enactment of this
act.
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 622 ,
the
State
and
Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2015, by a vote of
272-152. ( Roll Call
#159 )
H.R. 622 amends the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 to make permanent an itemized deduction for state and local
general sales taxes for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2014.
In
addition to H.R. 622, the House also passed
H.R. 1105 , the Death Tax Repeal Act
of 2015, by a vote of 240-179. ( Roll Call #161 ) H.R. 1105 repeals the
estate and generation transfer skipping tax and reduce the highest gift
tax rate from 40 percent to 35 percent, effective for decedents dying
and gifts made on or after the date of enactment. H.R. 1105 also
provides for a transition rule for assets placed in a qualified domestic
trust by a decedent who died before the date of enactment. The rule
provides that an estate tax will not be imposed on distributions before
the death of a surviving spouse from the trust more than ten years
after the date or enactment or assets remaining in the qualified domestic
trust upon the death of the surviving
spouse.

inauguration of Dr. Bowen, the 12th president of Arkansas
