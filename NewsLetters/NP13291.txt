Sacrifices Start Here
Friends,
Congress has its work cut out in 2014, and many tough decisions lie ahead.
We must provide relief for the millions now feeling the pain from
ObamaCare's
mandates, deadlines, security threats and unaffordable premiums. We must invest in our
nations ports and waterways
including those in South Mississippi - to support U.S. trade expansion and provide much-needed economic growth. We must enact
flood insurance relief
for people across the nation who are facing drastic increases as well as unclear and inconsistent FEMA policies. We must work to end damaging automatic sequester
cuts that threaten our men and women in uniform , and instead make cuts to government waste, fraud and abuse.
Ive heard from many of you who agree that these initiatives must remain priorities in 2014.
And I also agree with many of you who feel that
sacrifices should start with Congres s.
Leaders must live by the laws they create. That is why, two years ago, I decided to cosponsor the
End Pensions in Congress Act
and I called on my colleagues to join me in forfeiting their congressional pensions. That is also why I will raise these issues once more as Congress returns to Washington this week. You can join me by becoming a Citizen Cosponsor of this legislation
here .
More than ever, I believe that Americans need leaders who will place
people above politics . And they need to know their elected representatives hear their voices loud and clear.
As always, I welcome your feedback, and I encourage you to connect using my
website ,
twitter , and
facebook .
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
