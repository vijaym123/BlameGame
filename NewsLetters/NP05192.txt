Dear Friends,
This week I had the opportunity to do some Q&amp;A with students of Mike Perales&#8217; U.S. history class at Buchanan High School in Clovis. They were well-prepared with great
questions on government and history, leading to an excellent discussion. Thank you to Mr. Perales, his students, and Buchanan High for hosting me.
Separately, the Nunes Digest is updated for your weekend reading
here .
Sincerely ,
Devin Nunes
