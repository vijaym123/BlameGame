With the start of a new year and
the new Congress I am excited about the opportunities ahead for the
House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2015 and the 114 th
Congress.
Last month Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman Fred Upton named me to three leading subcommittees for the
114thCongress.
I will serve on the Communications and Technology
Subcommittee, the Energy and Power Subcommittee, and the Health
Subcommittee.
These three subcommittees cover a large majority of the full
committees policy jurisdiction, and I look forward to having a hand in
crafting major legislation beginning at the ground
floor.
In the last Congress the Energy and Commerce Committee had a solid
record of success aimed at creating jobs and modernizing
government.
All told more than 50 bills became law, while 40 ended up
languishing in the Harry Reid led Senate.
In the 114 th
Congress the Communications and Technology Subcommittee will strive
to update the
Communications Act , which was last updated in
1996.
The subcommittee spent last year gathering information and
public input on updating this law for the innovation era in an effort
to foster job creation.
A part of the full committees record of
success in the 113 th
Congress was the passage of the
STELA Reauthorization Act , which was signed into law late last
year. This legislation, especially important for rural areas, ensures that
1.5 million satellite television subscribers continue to receive
broadcast programming and makes a number of changes to improve the video
marketplace for consumers.
I am looking forward
to helping the Energy and Power Subcommittee build on the Architecture
of Abundance energy strategy in the 114 th . The
Architecture of Abundance energy strategy is based on five pillars: 1, building a
modern energy infrastructure; 2, maintaining diverse electricity
generation; 3, permitting a new manufacturing renaissance into existence;
4, harnessing new energy innovation and commonsense efficiencies;
and 5, unleashing a new era of American energy diplomacy.
This subcommittee will look to advance a new energy policy for our
country that says yes to energy.
Our country has the energy
resources to increase energy security here at home.
Tapping into our
nations resources in a safe and responsible way means cheaper energy
for American families and more jobs.We have plentiful energy resources
in our country and need policies in place that allow for us to tap into
those energy resources.
The Health Subcommittee will
build on the efforts of the 21st Century Cures initiative.
The
goal of this initiative is to accelerate the pace of cures and medical
breakthroughs in our country.
Last year the committee hosted a
number of hearings and roundtables in Washington and across the
country gathering ideas about how to speed up the discovery, development,
and delivery of new cures and treatments.
Early this year, my
colleagues and I on the Health Subcommittee will unveil a legislative
package to be considered as we move forward with this important
initiative.
It is important we are looking at new technologies and
advancements available in the telecommunications, energy and health care
arenas and how they can help spur economic growth and job creation.
The Energy and Commerce Committee will look to build on the committees
record of success in the 114th Congress, and I am ready to help
accomplish this goal.
