Questioning Treasury
Secretary Jack Lew on the National Debt
During an
Appropriations Subcommittee hearing last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack
Lew testified about the status of the fiscal health of our nation. I had
a chance to question Secretary Lew about the frustration and anger
many Americans have about the $17 trillion national debt our country has
racked up and Washington's culture of overspending and indifference
to this problem. As we know, both parties in Washington have been
responsible for overspending and we must work together in bipartisan
fashion if we are ever going to get our country's books
balanced.
While the House has put forward
responsible budgets that balance within 10 years, the current Administration
has submitted national budget proposals that only add more debt and
will never balance. Current estimates are we will borrow $6.6 trillion
more over the next 10 years. If we are going to solve this challenge
the President and Secretary Lew must put serious balanced solutions on
the table.

House passes first two Appropriations
Bills
After several weeks of Appropriations Subcommittee hearings
to provide oversight into how our federal agencies will spend tax
dollars on their programs, the House passed two Fiscal Year 2015
appropriations bills last week. With overwhelming bipartisan support, the House
passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations
bill, as well as the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. There are
a total of 12 appropriations bills, so we will continue working
through the next several weeks to pass the remaining ten funding
bills.
Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs
H.R.
4486
- the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill -
provides
$165 billion
in total budget authority for
FY 2015 programs and activities funded in the bill.
The bill
provides
$158 billion
in discretionary and mandatory
spending for the benefits and medical care of our nation's veterans, and
$6.6 billion
in discretionary spending for military
construction and family
housing.
Legislative Branch
H.R.
4487
- the Legislative Branch appropriations bill - provides a
total of
$3.3 billion
for the legislative branch,
including the offices of the Members of the House of Representatives,
support agencies, visitor services, and Capitol operations.
The
proposed FY 2015 funding is the same as FY 2014 and is
3.7
percent below
the President's
request.
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue
to look for ways to responsibly reduce spending and save taxpayer
dollars.
Remembering our Lost Community Members
I spoke
on the House floor last week to pay tribute to the three victims our
community lost three weeks ago as result of the tragic shootings at the
Jewish Community Center and Village Shalom in Overland Park. Reat
Underwood, Dr. Bill Corporan and Terri LaManno were beloved members of our
community and each will be greatly missed by friends and family. We
honor them and all victims of hate by doing our part to turn darkness
into light, and turning hatred into
love.

Fact of the
Week
The April jobs report was released Friday morning with
mixed messages.
Employers added
288,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to
6.3
percent.
But helping to
push the unemployment rate lower, however, was the decline in the
national labor force participation rate, which dropped to a near historic low
of
62.8 percent
after
806,000
Americans
simply left the labor
force.
