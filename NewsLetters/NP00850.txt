Dear Friend,
I hope this finds you well. Last week, I held
four public listening sessions throughout western and central Wisconsin
to hear your questions and concerns. Every year, I visit each of the
19 counties in the 3rd Congressional District to talk directly with our
neighbors. For more information, please visit my website by clicking
here .
Below are some of the important issues I've been working on
recently.
Raise the
Wage
For
far too long, many hard-working men and women have not been earning
livable or sustainable wages. The $7.25 an hour minimum wage set in 2009
has failed to keep up with inflation, decreasing the purchasing power
of those Americans living on minimum wage. Thats why I was proud to
cosponsor the Raise the Wage Act, H.R. 2150. This bill would help those
living on a minimum wage income deal with the rising cost of living
and inflation. We must ensure that workers in America receive a fair
days pay for doing a fair days work.
Medicaid
Expansion
I recently conducted a survey that
studied public opinion about federal support to expand Medicaid in
Wisconsin. The survey results were clear: over 82% of respondents agreed
that Medicaid expansion is good for Wisconsin. Click

to read the survey report. Wisconsin taxpayers are paying for
expanded Medicaid in states throughout the nation, but those taxes are
not coming back to benefit Wisconsin. According to the nonpartisan
Legislative Fiscal Bureau, an estimated 152,000 Wisconsinites would
qualify for Medicaid if Governor Walker accepts the federal funding. I urge
Governor Walker to follow the lead of other Republican Governors
around the country and accept Medicaid expansion.
Tomah
VA
The allegations being made at the Tomah
VA are extremely serious. Last week, I attended a veterans town hall
at the Tomah VA hosted by Dr. Carolyn Clancy, VA Interim Under
Secretary for Health. The town hall provided an important opportunity for
dialogue between VA leadership, veterans and their family members. As the
investigations continue, we owe it to our veterans to do everything
we can to fix the problems that have occurred at the VA to ensure that
they receive the care and treatment that they deserve. That's why I
recently led the Wisconsin House delegation in introducing the
bipartisan Inspectors General Transparency Act, which would ensure that all
Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports are published on the OIG
website and submitted to Congress. We must get to the bottom of the problems
at the VA, and fix what needs to be fixed. This is my top
priority.
