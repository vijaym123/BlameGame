We Need an Inspector General for Obamacare
Dear Friends,
I joined with Representative Peter Roskum to introduce H.R. 4158 to create a Special Inspector General for Monitoring Obamacare (SIGMA).
The Inspector General of the Afghanistan Reconstruction saved at least $321 million.
The Inspector General of the Iraq reconstruction saved at least $612 million.
The Inspector General for SIGTARP, a federal loan purchasing program, saved at least $5.24 billion.
These Inspector Generals save this money by identifying and eliminating the inevitable fraud and waste that come with federal programs.
They also have the power to compel an administration to cooperate with the review and expose the details of programs.
President Obama supported many of these in the past but remains silent when it comes to an Inspector General for Obamacare.
We deserve to know all the effects of $1.8 trillion Obamacare law on our state and our country.
As I continue to fight to repeal Obamacare and curtail its pain for Wyoming, please
share your concerns .
I remain honored to serve you in the U.S. House and I will not stop fighting for Wyoming.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

and
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
