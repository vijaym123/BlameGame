Listening To
Veterans, Addressing Health Care Shortfalls
Because of
the unique challenges our veterans face and the solemn sacrifices
they make, Congress must support the needs of service members both on the
battlefield and upon their return.
The recent exposure of the
shameful mistreatment of veterans seeking assistance through the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) again underscores the need to
improve the delivery of assistance to our nations veterans.
The
scandals prove that the stakes are high: Congress must get VA reform right
this time.
As I work with my congressional
colleagues to address the needs of our nations veterans, the polices I
advocate must have a meaningful impact on our veterans in Idaho.
I
invite Idahoans to share their VA experiences, both positive and negative,
with me through a brief survey.
The short survey contains
questions about the level of satisfaction veterans have with the VA
generally.
It also asks where veterans receive health care treatment if
they use VA facilities.
Idahoans in need of
specific assistance in dealing with the VA or other federal agencies
and navigating programs may also contact any one of my offices for
further assistance through the survey or separately.
As of today,
over 800 Idaho veterans have reached out and taken the survey.
This
feedback is critical to meaningful, smart reforms to our VA
system.
Thank you to all the veterans, their families and advocates for
providing my office with this actionable
information.
There is still time and there are multiple ways to complete the brief
survey through whatever means is most convenient.
Veterans can
take the survey online through my website at
http://www.crapo.senate.gov/contact/survey.cfm
and through the Idaho
Division of Veterans Services.
Veterans can also call one of
my offices
to have a staff member administer the
survey.
The following phone numbers can be used to reach my
offices:
Washington, DC (202) 224-6142; Idaho State Office (Boise)
208-334-1776; South-Central Idaho (Twin Falls) (208) 734-2515; North
Idaho (Coeur d Alene) (208) 664-5490; Eastern Idaho, North (Idaho Falls)
(208) 522-9779; North-Central Idaho (Lewiston) (208) 743-1492;
Eastern Idaho, South (Pocatello) (208) 236-6775.
August
State Work Period
I had the great fortune of
spending much of my time during the August state work period with Idaho
veterans.
My time at care centers, VA facilities, homes and coffee
shops with the veteran community, along with our recent survey, will
help me to formulate common-sense solutions when I return to Washington,
D.C., and continue addressing much needed VA reforms.
Thank you, Mrs. Dauven, for
joining me in Twin Falls to honor veterans!
It was a privilege to sit down with
several veteran in Twin Falls.
Your work is vital to the men and
women who have served our great country.
I had the opportunity to meet with a 2009
recipient of the Spirit of Freedom Award, Bob Jackson, when honoring
veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Cold War.
Thank
you to Genesis Health for hosting this event at their Twin Falls Care
Center
At a
veterans recognition ceremony earlier this week in Twin Falls, I had
the pleasure of presenting the Spirit of Idaho Award to Heidi Walker
(pictured right), staff and administrators like Tom Mikesell and Tami
Slatter (also pictured) of Hospice Visions for going above and
beyond in their service to Magic Valley veterans receiving end-of-life
care.
Their commitment to the men and women who have served and
their work to ensure they receive recognition for their service truly
embodies the spirit of our great state.
World War II
Veteran, Quentin Murdock, Receives Spirit of Freedom
Award
On August 28, I
had the honor of presenting the Spirit of Freedom Award to a true
American Hero, Quentin Murdock.
Quentin served in the North Africa
and Sicily Campaigns of World War II.
He was taken prisoner for
ten days, was rescued from a sunken boat and became a seasoned combat
soldier.
He went on to serve in the Allied invasion of
German-occupied France in the Normandy landings at Omaha Beach.
Quentin
earned a number of medals for his outstanding service.
These
include a Silver Star for gallantry in action, two Bronze Stars, three
Presidential Unit Citations, a European Theater with five campaigns, a
Combat Infantry Badge and the D-Day Commemorative Medal.
Upon his
return home, he worked for three years as a County Agent in the
Agriculture Extension Service of the University of Idaho and got
married.
He then became a farmer and grew his farming operation to nearly
1,800 acres of potatoes, sugar beets and wheat, which he scaled back in
2001.
He also had a 3,000 head feedlot that he owned until
1980.
Quentin has given greatly for our nation.
I normally
present Spirit of Freedom awards in November.
But, after hearing
Quentins story of selfless service, finding a way to honor him now seemed
most appropriate.
Presenting him with the 2014 Spirit of
Freedom Award was an honor.
Dedicating Idahos
Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway
It is
incredibly fitting for Idahos busiest freeway to now be designated as the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway. It has been far too long for this
recognition to come, and I appreciate the opportunity to have been
included at the ceremony in front of the Capitol Building in
Boise.
