David --
Fighting for all Illinoisans is my passion.
So when I see leaders like Brad Schneider standing up and speaking out on issues important to Illinois in Congress, I am proud and appreciative.
Since his first day, Brad&rsquo;s fought for equality in the workplace, to protect our environment, and to lift the burden of crippling student loan debt. But, Brad&rsquo;s first re-election campaign is one of the most competitive in the entire country. He needs our help urgently.
The critical Federal Election Commission fundraising deadline is just 2 days away, and he needs us to help him hit his fundraising goal. David, will you please contribute $5 or more to Brad&rsquo;s campaign to help his fight?
David, Brad&rsquo;s counting on our support; he needs our help, and we need his!
