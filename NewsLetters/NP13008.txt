Dear
Friend,
If you, or someone you know, is planning to attend college
in the coming year, now is the time to begin thinking about resources
available to help with the cost.
On January 1, the Department of
Education began accepting the
Free Application for
Federal Student Aid
forms.
Completing this set of forms,
commonly known as FAFSA, is the first step toward applying for grants,
work-study, and educational loans at nearly every university in the
country.
The Office of Student Federal Aid offers more than $150
billion annually to help millions of students pay for higher
education.
There is no age limit when it comes to applying for federal
financial aid, and most students qualify for some form of assistance.
To be eligible, students must be a U.S. citizen or eligible
noncitizen and be enrolled in a college or career school.
The
amount of financial aid students and parents may receive depends on several
factors including:
the cost of the school, the students
enrollment status, and the familys expected financial
contribution.
The federal deadline for completing the FAFSA is June 30, but
many states and schools have
earlier
deadlines
some as early as February, and many in
March.
If you have any questions regarding applying for federal financial
aid, please feel free to contact my office at 801-486-1236.
I
am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours.
As your representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on
current topics and issues affecting you and our community.
Please
let me know
areas you find
especially interesting or where I can provide you with additional
information.
I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
