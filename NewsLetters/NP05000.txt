Celebrating Michigans Harvest Season
Agriculture is a $92 billion industry in Michigan that employs nearly a million people on farms that are primarily family-owned. In the Thumb
Michigans breadbasket
we have the most productive farms.
Many of them have become destinations for those near and far, contributing to our booming agritourism industry that helps draw customers to other surrounding businesses.
This autumn, harvest season for our local farmers, is the perfect time to celebrate their contributions.
Here is a short video
