News from Representative Peter Roskam
Work needed to fix VA hospital system
By Congressman Peter Roskam
Over the past several weeks, disturbing reports have emerged of
widespread mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
that resulted in shockingly poor treatment of our veterans at
facilities across the country, including at Chicagoland's own Edward
Hines Jr. VA Hospital.
News of secret, off-the-book waiting lists for veterans seeking
treatment in Phoenix used by VA officials in order to artificially
lower reported wait times for care are clearly just the tip of the
iceberg.
The VA scandal came into sharp focus last week, when the VA Inspector
General confirmed suspicions of "systemic" delayed medical care and
wait list fraud throughout the VA health system. Manipulating waiting
lists enabled hospitals to circumvent the VA mandate that patients
receive care within 14 days of submitting a request, which in turn
yielded successful performance reviews and millions of dollars in
bonuses for VA management officials. The IG's report also found that
veterans at the Phoenix VA experienced average wait times of 114 days
for primary care - nearly five times longer than what was officially
reported - and that 1,700 veterans were kept off waiting lists
altogether.
Since the scandal broke, the VA has reportedly expanded its
investigation from 10 to 42 medical facilities nationwide. While the
Department is not disclosing which facilities are under investigation,
I hope and expect they will look into allegations of secret waiting
lists and improper delays at Hines VA Hospital, as well as claims that
veterans received informational briefings and in-group general
consultations instead of necessary medical care, again a concerted
effort to cook the books instead of meeting the needs of veterans.
Problems at Hines date back to at least 1999, when the Inspector
General found the hospital had, "the most inefficient physical plant
for inpatient care and the most significant compliance issues with
patient privacy." Now, new documents allege that five veterans died
while waiting for care at Hines and yet, shockingly, since 2011
hospital employees were awarded a staggering $16.6 million in
performance bonuses.
For years now, the House Veterans Affairs Committee has been conducting
a bipartisan investigation into broad VA mismanagement and corruption
issues, including unsanitary conditions, the immense claims backlog,
and in some cases, woefully substandard care. The goal has been to
change the system and fix these problems.
We already know thousands of veterans and their families have been hurt
by delays in treatment and substandard care, and that number is likely
to grow as more veterans come forward. House Republicans are
encouraging those impacted by VA mismanagement to share their stories
at gop.gov/yourstory so we can more fully understand the scope of this
problem and fix it.
The men and women who bravely fought for our country deserve immediate
action and immediate consequences for those VA employees who broke
faith with our veterans. Secretary Eric Shinseki was right to step down
as head of the VA, but it is clear the problem goes well beyond one
person. Fixing this problem requires new management throughout the VA,
and a culture of transparency and accountability across the whole
system.
Recently, the House passed the VA Management Accountability Act to give
Department leaders every possible tool to improve management and hold
their team responsible for delivering high quality care to our nation's
veterans, or else face termination. This legislation gives the VA
secretary the legal authority to demote or fire senior department
executives who are not fulfilling their responsibilities. The Senate
should immediately take up this bill so we can send it to the president
without delay. Sweeping changes are needed to eliminate institutional
corruption and make the VA work again, and House Republicans are
committed to making this right for our veterans and their families.

also

that
veterans

Phoenix
VA
experienced
average
wait

of
114
days

&#8211;
nearly

Since
the
scandal

the
VA

reportedly
expanded
its
investigation
from
10
to
42
medical
facilities
nationwide.
While
the
Department
is
not
disclosing
which
facilities
are
under
investigation,
I
hope
and
expect
they
will
look
into
allegations
of
secret
waiting
lists
and
improper
delays
at
Hines
VA
Hospital,
as
well
as
claims
that
veterans
received
informational
briefings
and

instead
of
necessary
medical
care,
again
a
concerted

date
back
to

&#8220;the

shockingly,

Secretary

the

it
is

goes
