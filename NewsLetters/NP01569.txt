Dear Friend,
President Obama nominated Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General on November 8, 2014. For the last 156 days, Ms. Lynch has been waiting for a confirmation vote -- a vote that Republican Senate Leader McConnell seems eager to avoid. Senator McConnell needs to schedule a vote on Loretta Lynch without further delay -- sign our petition if you agree.
Loretta Lynch has a sterling reputation as a public servant and an outstanding record of achievement as a prosecutor. If confirmed, she will become the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General. But the Senate cannot confirm Ms. Lynch&rsquo;s nomination if the Republican leadership won&rsquo;t schedule a vote.
The Attorney General is our nation&rsquo;s top law enforcement officer, and all nominations for the position should be put forward to a full Senate vote as soon as possible. There is no excuse for the kind of delay Loretta Lynch has faced. Add your name to mine and demand that Senator McConnell schedule Loretta Lynch&rsquo;s nomination for a vote.
Thank you,
Ed
