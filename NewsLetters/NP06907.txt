Update from Senator Bob Corker
August 17,
2014
Senator Corker traveled to Lawrence,
Madison, Tipton, Shelby, Henderson, Decatur and Davidson counties last
week to meet with Tennesseans and provide an update on his work to
solve the big issues facing our nation. He also partnered with Google to
host

events to help small
businesses grow their presence online.

Helping Tennessee Small
Businesses Boost Online Presence
More than 125
Tennessee small business owners had the opportunity to create a free
website last week at events hosted by Senator Corker and
Google.
At
Tennessee Get Your Business Onlin e events in Jackson
and Nashville, Google experts helped small business owners create a
free website, and provided attendees with a customized domain name, free
web hosting for one year, a local business listing on Google Maps, and
additional tools, training and resources. The Google experts also
helped train participants on how to reach more customers
online.
These events were a great opportunity for small businesses to
create a website and learn about growing their brand online, said
Corker. As a former businessman, it was inspiring to see Tennessees
entrepreneurial spirit in action, and I look forward to hosting similar
events with Google across the Volunteer State.
The events,
which were free and open to all Tennesseans, were designed to provide
an easy and fast way for businesses to create a website and become
more visible online. While 97 percent of Internet users look online for
local products and services, 59 percent of Tennessee small businesses
do not have a website or online presence.
Businesses unable
to attend the events can still create a free website and access
relevant resources by visiting
www.TennesseeGetOnline.com .
