Preserving our Great Lakes
Our Great Lakes and surrounding waterways are not only essential to our economic livelihood; they are a way of life for us &#8211; especially for those of us who grew up on the water.
From fishing and hunting
to boating to just strolling along the beautiful shorelines, these magnificent Lakes have been a source of enjoyment for generations, and it is important that we keep them that way.
Here is a short video highlighting some of the restoration and conservation
projects underway in St. Clair County, including projects at Pearl Beach, Harsens Island and Chrysler Beach.
