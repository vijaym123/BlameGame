Week in Review
Dear Friends,
Thanks for signing up to receive my e-newsletter!
Read on to learn more about what I have been working on in Washington and at home in Central New York.
On the Floor: Fighting Cyber-Attacks With Pro-Privacy Legislation
Our nation faces growing, costly cybersecurity threats.
This week, the House passed legislation to address these vulnerabilities by encouraging information sharing on cyber-attacks.
This bill includes a bipartisan amendment that I introduced to ensure that we are mindful of privacy and civil liberty concerns.
It puts clear restrictions on what information may be used and shared by the federal government.
Read more about this legislation,

Fighting the War on Synthetic Drugs
Synthetic drug use is a growing problem in Central New York , and we need to ensure that our community is aware of the dangers of these substances.
Early this week I
joined Syracuse Chief of Police Frank Fowler and Teresa Woolson, a local advocate who lost her son to synthetic marijuana, to raise awareness for this growing and tragic epidemic in Central New York.

Meetings Around the District
Members of the Somali-Bantu Community Association
stopped by my Syracuse district office to talk about all of the important work they do to aid our local refugee population.
I look forward to working with this group, and the other refugee groups in our community, to help to provide opportunities in Central New York.
ITT Technical Institute gave me a great tour of their campus and hands-on education centers in Liverpool.
I enjoyed learning about all of the technology-oriented programs and vocational training offered right here in CNY.
I had the opportunity to visit Anheuser-Busch's large operation in Baldwinsville.
This large manufacturer employs nearly 700 Central New Yorkers and is a critical driver of our local economy.
One of the best parts about being a Member of Congress is honoring our local heroes.
It was my pleasure to recognize Virginia Carmody, Executive Director of the Literacy Coalition of Onondaga County, for her tireless work to ensure that literacy is a path out of poverty.
She recently received the 'Women Who Make America Award,'
and I had the opportunity to present her with a statement that I submitted for the Congressional Record in her honor.
Congratulations, Ginny!
