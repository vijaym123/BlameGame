Friend
Wanted to highlight an important bill for you: The Firearm Manufacturers and Dealers Protection Act ( H.R. 1413 ), which was recently introduced, stops the Administration from using Operation Choke Point (or any similar programs) to target the firearm industry.
Under Operation Choke Point, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Department of Justice were permitted to place immense regulatory pressure on financial institutions doing business with firearms and ammunition manufacturers
thus essentially working to cripple the industry. While the FDIC is now claiming that it has stopped targeting firearms manufacturers under Operation Choke Point, I believe more must be done to ensure the Second Amendment is not infringed upon. Thats why Im cosponsoring this bill to entirely defund any activities associated with Operation Choke Point, and forbid the U.S. Attorney General from restarting a similar program.
I will keep you posted on its progress.
Yours in service,
Randy
