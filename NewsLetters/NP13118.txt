Washington, D.C. - Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) issued the
following statement
after
President Obama's speech concerning the government's domestic
surveillance programs:
"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall
not be violated...."
The Founders proposed the Fourth Amendment to end once and for
all suspicionless searches and seizures of Americans' personal property
and information.
We now know that for some years our government has collected
private information about our communications-and in many cases, the
communications themselves. The government does this despite the fact
that it suspects us of no wrongdoing.
Nothing the President said today will end the unconstitutional
invasion of Americans' privacy.
The President said he will not end the Patriot Act's Sec. 215
program that collects the records of every phone call every American
makes. Instead, he said that the government will continue to search
those records without a warrant-but just a little less vigorously.
The President said that when the government issues a subpoena
to an Internet service provider for an American's records, the
government still can impose a permanent gag order on the ISP-but just
when the government "demonstrates a real need for further secrecy."
The President said that the era of secret law will continue,
that the court decisions that have contorted Congress's limits on
surveillance into broad authorizations will remain secret-but the
intelligence officials who have executed mass surveillance and lied to
Congress will, in their discretion, release some of the rulings as they
see fit.
Congress must do what the President apparently will not: end
the unconstitutional violation of Americans' privacy, stop the
suspicionless surveillance of our people, and close the era of secret
law.
A coalition of 125 House members from both sides of the aisle
have signed on to the USA FREEDOM Act
.
We must make the Freedom Act law.
