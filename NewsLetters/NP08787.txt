June 15, 2014
Dear Friend,
With 1.7 million veterans calling Texas home, including over 100,000
who live in San Antonio, we've seen first -hand the bravery of these
men and women who fought to uphold our democratic values and guard the
freedoms we enjoy every day. As lawmakers, we must continue our
commitment to them.
They're our family members, our neighbors, and our
friends.
We owe it to these veterans to show our gratitude for their
sacrifices by caring for them with the high-quality resources and
healthcare that they deserve.
I'm pleased to have voted in support of H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access
to Care Act of 2014 this week in Congress. It passed the U.S. House of
Representatives unanimously. This bill addresses VA medical care and
wait times, as well as reimbursement for non-VA providers.
Here's how the Veterans Access to Care supports our nation's veterans
and provides accountability and transparency:
*	The bill would allow veterans to seek treatment at non-VA
facilities if they:
*	Reside more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility,
*	Have waited longer than the wait-time goals for a
medical appointment, or
*	Have been notified by VA that an appointment is not
available within the wait-time goals and who elects to receive care at
a non-VA facility.
*	It would require the VA to reimburse non-VA providers at the
greater of the following rates: the rate of reimbursement under VA, the
rate of reimbursement under Medicare, or the rate of reimbursement
under TRICARE.
*	It would require the VA to enter into a contract with an
independent entity or entities to conduct an independent assessment of
the health care provided in VA medical facilities.
*	It includes the elimination of bonuses and performance awards
for all VA employees for fiscal years (FYs) 2014 through 2016.
Meanwhile, the Senate passed their own comprehensive measure to address
the VA issues and expand access to healthcare. This measure passed by
93-3 earlier this week. Both Chambers have acted for our veterans in a
bicameral, bipartisan manner. I look forward to the bills getting
reconciled together to be able to send to the President's desk for his
signature. These reforms are a significant step forward to ensure we
honor our commitments to our veterans and their families.
Congressional Bronze Medal
My office awarded the Congressional Bronze Medal to Ana McCandless who
graduated from Holmes High School this week.
The Congressional Award
was created by Congress in 1979 and is awarded to young Americans who
meet goals in areas including volunteer public service, personal
development, physical fitness, and exploration.
Ana earned this award by volunteering over 200 hours of service to her
local community. Her involvement included serving as a Counselor in
Training at Camp Independence, a children's assistant at Forrest Hills
Library, and volunteering with a children's shelter book drive.
As a Representative of Military City, USA I will continue to ensure
that my work in Congress reflects the needs of our nation's veterans.
We must safeguard the integrity of the benefits that have been promised
to them and ensure that they're receiving the high-quality care they
have earned.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
Join Me....
In Case You Missed It
I applaud the President's efforts to address the ever growing issue of
student loan debt. Link
Tech companies in San Antonio and across Texas are changing the
economic landscape of our state for the better. I will continue to work
to ensure that just as we are attracting these businesses to our state,
we are also investing in the education necessary to grow local talent
to strengthen our economic future. Link

Dear
Friend,
With
1.7
million
veterans
calling
Texas
home,
including
over
100,000
who
live
in
San
Antonio,
we&#8217;ve
seen
first
&#8211;hand
the
bravery
of
these
men
and
women
who
fought
to
uphold
our
democratic
values
and
guard
the
freedoms
we
enjoy
every
day. As
lawmakers,
we
must
continue
our
commitment
to
them.
They&#8217;re
our
family
members,
our
neighbors,
and
our
friends.
We
owe
it
to
these
veterans
to
show
our
gratitude
for
their
sacrifices
by
caring
for
them
with
the
high-quality
resources
and
healthcare
that
they
deserve.
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
have
voted
in
support
of
H.R.
4810,
the
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
of
2014
this
week
in
Congress.
It
passed
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
unanimously.
This
bill
addresses
VA
medical
care
and
wait
times,
as
well
as
reimbursement
for
non-VA
providers.
Here&#8217;s
how
the
Veterans
Access
to
Care
supports
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
and
provides
accountability
and
transparency:
The
bill
would
allow
veterans
to
seek
treatment
at
non-VA
facilities
if
they:
Reside
more
than
40
miles
from
a
VA
medical
facility, Have
waited
longer
than
the
wait-time
goals
for
a
medical
appointment,
or Have
been
notified
by
VA
that
an
appointment
is
not
available
within
the
wait-time
goals
and
who
elects
to
receive
care
at
a
non-VA
facility. It
would
require
the
VA
to
reimburse
non-VA
providers
at
the
greater
of
the
following
rates:
the
rate
of
reimbursement
under
VA,
the
rate
of
reimbursement
under
Medicare,
or
the
rate
of
reimbursement
under
TRICARE. It
would
require
the
VA
to
enter
into
a
contract
with
an
independent
entity
or
entities
to
conduct
an
independent
assessment
of
the
health
care
provided
in
VA
medical
facilities. It
includes
the
elimination
of
bonuses
and
performance
awards
for
all
VA
employees
for
fiscal
years
(FYs)
2014
through
2016.
Meanwhile,
the
Senate
passed
their
own
comprehensive
measure
to
address
the
VA
issues
and
expand
access
to
healthcare.
This
measure
passed
by
93-3
earlier
this
week. Both
Chambers
have
acted
for
our
veterans
in
a
bicameral,
bipartisan
manner.
I
look
forward
to
the
bills
getting
reconciled
together
to
be
able
to
send
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk
for
his
signature.
These
reforms
are
a
significant
step
forward
to
ensure
we
honor
our
commitments
to
our
veterans
and
their
families.
Congressional
Bronze
Medal
My
office
awarded
the
Congressional
Bronze
Medal
to
Ana
McCandless
who
graduated
from
Holmes
High
School
this
week.
The
Congressional
Award
was
created
by
Congress
in
1979
and
is
awarded
to
young
Americans
who
meet
goals
in
areas
including
volunteer
public
service,
personal
development,
physical
fitness,
and
exploration.
Ana
earned
this
award
by
volunteering
over
200
hours
of
service
to
her
local
community.
Her
involvement
included
serving
as
a
Counselor
in
Training
at
Camp
Independence,
a
children&#8217;s
assistant
at
Forrest
Hills
Library,
and
volunteering
with
a
children&#8217;s
shelter
book
drive.
As
a
Representative
of
Military
City,
USA
I
will
continue
to
ensure
that
my
work
in
Congress
reflects
the
needs
of
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans.
We
must
safeguard
the
integrity
of
the
benefits
that
have
been
promised
to
them
and
ensure
that
they&#8217;re
receiving
the
high-quality
care
they
have
earned.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
