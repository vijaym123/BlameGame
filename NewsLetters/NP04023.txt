The Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, or ABLE Act, gives people with disabilities the opportunity to save for their daily and long-term expenses through tax-free savings accounts. The House passed this bipartisan legislation on Wednesday and I was pleased to support it.
Currently, people with disabilities can only save $2,000, or risk losing access to federal programs such as Medicaid or the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. This limits them and their families from preparing for future expenses.
As Sara Wolff, a woman with Down Syndrome,
shared
with the
Washington Post
earlier this year:
The ABLE Act is so much more to people with Down Syndrome and other disabilities than just a savings account. It puts a stake in the ground so people can live independently, work, go to college. Its time to move into the 21st century and allow individuals with disabilities to be self-determined, and not let these laws hold them back.
The ABLE Act would help provide individuals with disabilities a financial planning tool similar to the popular 529 college savings accounts. The ABLE Act savings accounts would help individuals prepare for expenses such as housing, education, employment support or transportation. This would not replace benefits already provided through other sources such as Medicaid or the SSI program, but supplement them.
All children deserve an opportunity to reach their potential and live a full life. Learn more about the ABLE Act
