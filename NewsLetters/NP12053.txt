Dear Friend,
Please join me for a Telephone Town Hall on Thursday, February 27 at 10
AM PST. I will answer your questions about the issues affecting you and
your family, and provide an update on what is going on in Congress.
Please sign up for my free telephone town hall here.
The telephone town hall lasts approximately one hour, and you are
welcome to stay on the line and listen for as long as you can.
Instructions will be given to callers who would like to ask a question,
and I do my best to take as many questions as possible.
Federal communication laws only permit us to call constituents who have
signed up with a land line phone number, so please remember to sign up
using a land line.
As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. To
stay in touch, please connect with me on Twitter @RepSwalwell
