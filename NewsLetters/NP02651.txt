Jackson Holes New Baggage Claim
Dear Friends,
This week I attended the grand opening for Jackson Hole Airports new baggage claim area.
This airport, like Wyomings many other airports, is critical to our local economies and I am pleased to see this one expand capacity. Catch my Cattle Call video this week, where I talk to the airports outgoing chairman of the board Jerry Blann about this latest development.
And please feel free to let me know any of your
thoughts and concerns .
Sincerely,
This mailbox is unattended.
