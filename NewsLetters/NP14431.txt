A
message
from me to our Veterans and Active Military this Veterans Day.. .
Happy Veterans Day. Today, we honor the brave Veterans of our nation - without whom, our freedom would not be possible.
Because of their service, our freedom endures.
Today, I ask you and your family to join me in taking a moment to acknowledge those who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the freedoms we enjoy as Americans. We also honor those who are risking their lives at this very moment, both at home and abroad, to serve our country, keep us safe and protect the values we hold dear.
May God Bless you and your family, and May God Bless the Brave Heroes of This Nation: Our Veterans.
