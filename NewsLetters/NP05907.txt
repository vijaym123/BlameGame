Barack Obama's election was one of the proudest days of my life. I felt like I had spent decades fighting for that moment...and in many ways I had.
But now 6 years later, Republicans are trying once again to tear the President down. And quite frankly, it terrifies me what they could do if they grow their Tea Party Majority in this election.
That's why I need your help. That's why I need you to answer President Obama's call-to-action right now. I'm not ready to give up on his last 2 years in office. And you shouldn't be either.
The most critical deadline of the election is in 3 days. Can I count on you right now? ALL GIFTS TODAY MATCHED!
