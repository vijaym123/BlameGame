A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
December 12, 2014
Dear Friends,
As of this writing, the Senate was preparing to vote later tonight or
tomorrow on a nine-month omnibus appropriations bill to fund the
federal government for fiscal year 2015. I intend to support this
legislation for a number of reasons, with Georgia's priorities at the
forefront of my mind. First, the bill includes funding to ensure the
federal share of funding for Georgia's number one economic development
project -- the expansion and deepening of the Port of Savannah.
The bill also includes a provision to rein in the EPA's overreach with
respect to the 'waters of the United States' proposal, which would
subject Georgia's farmers to costly and intrusive federal regulation
and would harm Georgia's biggest industry.
Within Congress lies the power of the purse, and House and Senate
Republicans intend to act to prevent the president from implementing
his proposed executive action on immigration by stemming funding in the
Department of Homeland Security's fiscal year 2015 budget. The omnibus
legislation includes a two-month extension of DHS funding. By providing
only short-term funding for the Department of Homeland Security through
February, the bill gives Republicans in the House and Senate an
opportunity to have full control over the process of advancing
legislation to defund the President's amnesty order early next year.
As the 113th Congress draws to a close, Senate Republicans are gearing
up for their new majority in January. Omnibus appropriations bills are
never a good way to do business, and come January 6, 2015, the new
Republican Senate majority will return to doing individual and
transparent appropriations bills throughout the year in a timely
fashion. The American people deserve no less.
I will continue my fight next year to reform America's budget and
spending process from an annual to a biennial budget, which would
reserve every other year for mandatory oversight to ensure that we
demand accountability from existing programs before we spend money on
new ones.
Defense Authorization
This week the Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense
Authorization Act that establishes funding levels for the U.S.
Department of Defense and sets the policies under which money will be
spent. I voted for this bill because it included many provisions
vitally important to Georgia, our national defense and our military
service members.
Senate Democrats' CIA Detention and Interrogation Report
On Tuesday, Senate Democrats released to the public their Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence and Majority's study of the CIA's Detention
and Interrogation Program.
Oversight of the federal government, including the intelligence
community, is an important and necessary responsibility of Congress.
However, this report presents a politically motivated and one-sided
account of the CIA's Detention and Interrogations program-a program
that, despite what this report alleges, helped develop intelligence
that led to action against threats to our national security. I believe
this report unfairly impugns U.S. intelligence professionals and
endangers Americans fighting terror as well as those being held captive
by our enemies.
EPA's Power Plan Rule
On Wednesday, Senator Saxby Chambliss and I, along with 21 of our
Senate Republican colleagues, sent a letter to Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy to express our deep concern
about the impact the EPA's proposed "existing source performance
standards" would have on electricity prices and power grid reliability.
In the letter, we called for the proposed rule's withdrawal, citing
unrealistic interim targets, a severely constrained timeline for
implementation and complications related to multistate resources among
the many concerns raised by stakeholders. For example, the proposed
rule does not account for the reduction of carbon dioxide into the
environment that will result in the expansion of clean nuclear energy
at Plant Vogtle in Augusta, Ga.
Our nation's families and businesses depend upon affordable, reliable
electricity. Unfortunately, EPA's "existing source performance
standards" proposal would constrain Americans' energy choices and
inflict significant economic harm without producing any tangible
environmental benefits. Click here to read the letter in its entirety.
Senator Chambliss' Farewell Floor Speech
It is a tradition for senators to deliver farewell speeches before
leaving the U.S. Senate. Senators that are retiring at the end of the
113th Congress have been giving their speeches for the last couple of
weeks. My longtime Georgia colleague with whom I share an even longer
friendship, Senator Saxby Chambliss, delivered his speech on Wednesday.
It was an emotional speech for both him and
me. I appreciate his words but more importantly, the legacy he and his
fine staff leave for Georgia from their work in agriculture, armed
services and intelligence, as well as their work helping Georgia
constituents needing assistance with government agencies. He has served
with distinction and with class.
The country will miss Senator Chambliss, and my grandchildren are safer
and our state is better because of his work. Georgia's going to love
having Senator Chambliss back home more often. To watch my full tribute

In Other News
On Monday I
enjoyed Skyping with 8th grade classes from Cliff Valley School in
Atlanta and Westside Middle School in Winder, Ga. I was also delighted
to receive a framed photograph from the University of Georgia from the
keynote address
I delivered during the 2014 Spring Commencement at Sanford Stadium in
May.
I was also interviewed this week on John Druckenmiller's "Hometown
Headlines" segment on WRGA in Rome, Ga.
What's on Tap?
The Senate is not in session next week in observance of Christmas.
During these past several weeks we have addressed a variety of
critically important issues, and now we welcome this holiday season and
the spirit of Christmas.
As we reflect on the things we have weathered
through this past year, it is equally important to recognize our many
blessings as a nation. In the spirit of this wonderful time of year,
Dianne and I wish you a holiday filled with joy, happiness and cheer.
Merry Christmas!
Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson

Weekly
e-Newsletter

Senator

Dear
Friends,
As
of
this
writing,
the
Senate
was
preparing
to
vote
later
tonight
or
tomorrow
on
a
nine-month
omnibus
appropriations
bill
to
fund
the
federal
government
for
fiscal
year
2015.
I
intend
to
support
this
legislation
for
a
number
of
reasons,
with
Georgia's
priorities
at
the
forefront
of
my
mind.
First,
the
bill
includes
funding
to
ensure
the
federal
share
of
funding
for
Georgia's
number
one
economic
development
project
--
the
expansion
and
deepening
of
the
Port
of
Savannah.
The
bill
also
includes
a
provision
to
rein
in
the
EPA's
overreach
with
respect
to
the
'waters
of
the
United
States'
proposal,
which
would
subject
Georgia's
farmers
to
costly
and
intrusive
federal
regulation
and
would
harm
Georgia's
biggest
industry.
Within
Congress
lies
the
power
of
the
purse,
and
House
and
Senate
Republicans
intend
to
act
to
prevent
the
president
from
implementing
his
proposed
executive
action
on
immigration
by
stemming
funding
in
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security's
fiscal
year
2015
budget.
The
omnibus
legislation
includes
a
two-month
extension
of
DHS
funding.
By
providing
only
short-term
funding
for
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
through
February,
the
bill
gives
Republicans
in
the
House
and
Senate
an
opportunity
to
have
full
control
over
the
process
of
advancing
legislation
to
defund
the
President's
amnesty
order
early
next
year.
As
the
113th
Congress
draws
to
a
close,
Senate
Republicans
are
gearing
up
for
their
new
majority
in
January.
Omnibus
appropriations
bills
are
never
a
good
way
to
do
business,
and
come
January
6,
2015,
the
new
Republican
Senate
majority
will
return
to
doing
individual
and
transparent
appropriations
bills
throughout
the
year
in
a
timely
fashion.
The
American
people
deserve
no
less.
I
will
continue
my
fight
next
year
to
reform
America's
budget
and
spending
process
from
an
annual
to
a
biennial
budget,
which
would
reserve
every
other
year
for
mandatory
oversight
to
ensure
that
we
demand
accountability
from
existing
programs
before
we
spend
money
on
new
ones.
Defense
Authorization
This
week
the
Senate
passed
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
that
establishes
funding
levels
for
the
U.S.
Department
of
Defense
and
sets
the
policies
under
which
money
will
be
spent.
I
voted
for
this
bill
because
it
included
many
provisions
vitally
important
to
Georgia,
our
national
defense
and
our
military
service
members.
Senate
Democrats'
CIA
Detention
and
Interrogation
Report
On
Tuesday,
Senate
Democrats
released
to
the
public
their
Senate
Select
Committee
on
Intelligence
and
Majority's
study
of
the
CIA's
Detention
and
Interrogation
Program.
Oversight
of
the
federal
government,
including
the
intelligence
community,
is
an
important
and
necessary
responsibility
of
Congress.
However,
this
report
presents
a
politically
motivated
and
one-sided
account
of
the
CIA's
Detention
and
Interrogations
program&mdash;a
program
that,
despite
what
this
report
alleges,
helped
develop
intelligence
that
led
to
action
against
threats
to
our
national
security.
I
believe
this
report
unfairly
impugns
U.S.
intelligence
professionals
and
endangers
Americans
fighting
terror
as
well
as
those
being
held
captive
by
our
enemies.
EPA's
Power
Plan
Rule
On
Wednesday,
Senator
Saxby
Chambliss
and
I,
along
with
21
of
our
Senate
Republican
colleagues,
sent
a
letter
to
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
Administrator
Gina
McCarthy
to
express
our
deep
concern
about
the
impact
the
EPA's
proposed
"existing
source
performance
standards"
would
have
on
electricity
prices
and
power
grid
reliability.
In
the
letter,
we
called
for
the
proposed
rule's
withdrawal,
citing
unrealistic
interim
targets,
a
severely
constrained
timeline
for
implementation
and
complications
related
to
multistate
resources
among
the
many
concerns
raised
by
stakeholders.
For
example,
the
proposed
rule
does
not
account
for
the
reduction
of
carbon
dioxide
into
the
environment
that
will
result
in
the
expansion
of
clean
nuclear
energy
at
Plant
Vogtle
in
Augusta,
Ga.
Our
nation's
families
and
businesses
depend
upon
affordable,
reliable
electricity.
Unfortunately,
EPA's
"existing
source
performance
standards"
proposal
would
constrain
Americans'
energy
choices
and
inflict
significant
economic
harm
without
producing
any
tangible
environmental
benefits.

Senator
Chambliss'
Farewell
Floor

My
longtime
Georgia
colleague
with
whom
I
share
an
even

friendship,
Senator
Saxby
Chambliss,
delivered
his
speech
on
Wednesday.
It
was
an
emotional
speech
for
both
him
and
me.
I
appreciate
his
words
but
more
importantly,
the
legacy
he
and
his
fine

leave
for
Georgia
from
their
work
in
agriculture,
armed
services
and
intelligence,
as
well
as

He
