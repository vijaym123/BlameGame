David,
61% of graduates in Connecticut leave college with student loan debt. It&rsquo;s often a debt people carry with them for decades as they struggle to buy a home, build a family, or open a business.
What&rsquo;s worse: our government made $66 billion in profit from student loans between 2007 and 2012, and stands to pocket an additional $185 billion in profits over the next 10 years.
I want every Senator to understand the reality: that real Americans are struggling simply because they wanted an education. I&rsquo;ll be speaking on the Senate floor about this very issue tomorrow evening, along with four of my colleagues, and I want to make sure everyone hears your story.
Take a minute to tell me about your debt: how have you worked to pay it off? How have your interest rates increased over the years?
Then,
tune in to C-SPAN tomorrow at 6pm EST . I&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re up there with me.
Thanks,
Senator Richard Blumenthal
