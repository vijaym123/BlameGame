What did you think of the State of the Union?
Thank you to everyone who submitted the priorities they hoped the President would discuss last week.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the President's speech.
I had hoped to hear the President demonstrate leadership and lay out a plan to work with Congress on issues important to our country.
However, what I heard was more of the same.
He continues to put forth ideas without a plan or the support of Congress to execute them. I support many of the same goals like growing the economy, increasing opportunities for the middle class, investing in transportation and improving technical education but differ on how we accomplish these goals.
We must work together to find areas where we can agree.
One example is my bill, the Hire More Heroes Act, to incentivize small businesses to hire more of our veterans by making a change to Obamacare.
This legislation passed the House with unanimous support earlier this month and passed the Senate Finance Committee this week.
It is my hope that the President will support this bipartisan bill to help veterans when it gets to his desk.
Go Senators! (the Springfield HS kind)
Thank you to Springfield High School for letting me come speak and have lunch!
One of the best parts of my job is being able to visit and speak to schools in my district.
If there is a school you would like me to visit, please give my office a call at 217-403-4690.

Touring Scott AFB's New Technology to Help Fight Ebola
Until now, the military has not had a way to safely transport members of the military, health workers and other volunteers if they were infected by Ebola which has made the fight against this deadly disease even more difficult.
This new transport isolation system developed at Scott Air Force Base will be used by the U.S. Department of Defense to safely transport patients with highly contagious diseases to hospitals around the world. I had the opportunity to tour this potentially life-saving technology last week and was so impressed by the work done by Gen. Paul Selva and his team.
Pictured below is Rep. Mike Bost (IL-12) and I touring the isolation system.
Did you know that the Super Bowl is a lucrative opportunity for human traffickers?
Between 16,000-25,000 women and children are exploited each year in Illinois and this is the fastest-growing business of organized crime in the world.
If you see something, say something.

This week I voted for and the House passed eight bills to prevent human trafficking.
Like with any other crime, putting an end to this terrible practice will require anyone who sees something to say something. These bills will better prepare those in state and local governments, law enforcement officials and healthcare workers to prevent, identify and help victims of trafficking.
