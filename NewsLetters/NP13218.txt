Dear
Friend,
Happy New Year to you
and your family. I hope you had a safe and happy holiday season.
With the new session one week underway and one day into our
second full week, I wanted to give you a look at what we have ahead.
Health
Care Reform Act
Numerous delays, exemptions
and significant security questions regarding healthcare.gov have left
me looking for an alternative. In support of options and the chance to
create a patient-centric, affordable health care system, I joined 217
house members in support of the
American Health Care
Reform Act (H.R. 3121) .
on Friday,
I voted in favor of
H.R. 3811, the
Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act of 2014 , to ensure immediate notification of any
security breaches resulting from Healthcare.gov and other sectors of
the Affordable Care Act.
Hearing on Proposed
Crowdfunding Rules
This Thursday,
well be having
a hearing in the Small
Business Committee
on the Security and Exchange Commissions
(SEC) recently released crowdfunding rule.
While this rule
provides some new capital raising opportunities for small, burgeoning
businesses, the SEC proposed a heavy-handed level of red tape to go along
with capital generation. I hope youll tune into the hearing to hear
what witnesses say about the benefits of expanding crowfunding
opportunities. You can watch the hearing live
here
Thursday, January 16, 2014 8:00 AM AZ/10:00 AM EST.
