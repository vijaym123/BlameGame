IRS Targeting Contempt
Vote
On Thursday, the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee voted to hold former IRS official, Lois Lerner, in contempt
of Congress for refusing to testify on her role in the IRS Tea Party
targeting scandal. The American people have lost faith in their
government--and they deserve answers. I will continue to fight for more
government transparency and accountability for my constituents and the
Amerian people as a whole. I wrote an op-ed for
Red Alert Politics
calling for more accountability for the IRS officials involved. You
can read my op-ed
here . I also
appeared on Fox News to discuss the vote. You can watch the interview
below.
Congressman
Meadows on Fox News
It's
Time for Sanctions on Hezbollah
Earlier
this week, I introduced legislation to impose harsh sanctions on
Hezbollah, the terrorist organization responsible for the largest number of
American deaths overseas second only to al Qaeda. The bill is the
first-ever legislation that will go after both Hezbollah's criminal
component and terrorism operation. You can read more about the bill in an
op-ed I wrote in the
Washington Examiner
here .
On Tuesday, I introduced
H.R. 4411 ,
calling for sanctions on Hezbollah and its network of illegal financial
backers.
Clyde
Elementary School's Trip to the Capitol
Speaking to students and teachers from Clyde
Elementary
Students from Clyde Elementary School came to visit the
U.S. Capitol on their trip through Washington, D.C. I greeted them
between votes on the House Floor to discuss the importance of civic
engagement. The students came prepared with great questions. A big THANK YOU
to the hard-working teachers who made what I'm sure will be a
memorable trip to our Nation's Capital possible for the
students.
Prayers for Madison
Cawthorne
My prayers are with Madison
Cawthorne, of Hendersonville, as he recovers from critical injuries
following a car crash last week in Daytona, Florida. Madison, 18, played
linebacker for the Asheville Saints football team in 2013. He is also a
member of Biltmore Baptist Church and has been nominated to the U.S.
Naval Academy. I pray for a swift recovery and for comfort to his family
and friends during this incredibly hard time. A Facebook page has
been created for people to show their support to the family. You can
visit it
here .
