The Hill: House clears
increase in veterans' disability
payments
9/17/14
By
Cristina Marcos
The
House on Tuesday evening cleared legislation to increase compensation
benefits for veterans with
disabilities.
Passed by voice vote, S. 2258 would
hike veterans' disability compensation starting on Dec. 1 so that the
cost-of-living increase would match the rate of Social Security
benefits.
The Senate passed the measure last week by unanimous consent, and it
now heads to President Obama for his
signature.
Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) argued the annual increase was
necessary to support
veterans.
"Many of those who sacrificed so much in recent and past
conflicts are in continued and increased need," Lamborn
said.
Rep. Ann
Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) said that the 4.5 million veterans and survivors who
rely on the benefits would see an eventual cut in benefit payments if
Congress doesn't
act.
"For some, it is their only source of income.
Without this annual COLA increase, veterans, their families and survivors
would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly erode,"
Kirkpatrick said.
