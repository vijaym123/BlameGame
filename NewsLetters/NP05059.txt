The Administration announced the
My E-Verify
program to allow individuals to lock their Social Security numbers to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent use.
The program is available in five states - Arizona, Idaho, Colorado, Mississippi, Virginia - as well as the District of Columbia, and will soon be used throughout the rest of the country.
While this program is an important improvement, there is much left to be done -- not only protect the personal information of American citizens and prevent theft and fraud, but also to verify the eligibility of those working in this country.
Thats why I supported the Legal Workforce Act,
H.R.1772 , to improve the E-verify system and make it mandatory for all U.S. employers to quickly, accurately, and easily ensure they are hiring workers legally.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
For me, no amnesty means no amnesty. Our immigration policy must reflect our core belief that entry into the United States is not a right, but a privilege. The government must ensure the safety and security of our nations borders. This cannot be done if we do not identify and monitor the constant flow of illegal immigrants into our country.
