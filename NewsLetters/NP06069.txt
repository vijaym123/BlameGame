Recently, concerns have been raised about maintaining an open Internet or net neutrality, which is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs), like Verizon and Comcast, provide access to all Internet content equally among companies and consumers.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed
new rules
to examine whether Internet Service Providers should be able to charge companies for faster delivery of content.
Those opposed say that allowing a large company, like Netflix, to pay a fee to Internet Service Providers, like Verizon, to guarantee that Netflix content would travel faster over Verizons network would amount to
paid prioritization , and result in discriminating against smaller companies who may not be able to afford to pay a similar fee.
Supporters of net neutrality in general believe that strict
regulation
is necessary to protect the Internet, and believe the FCC should treat broadband companies like other utilities, instead of allowing potentially discriminatory practices from Internet Service Providers.
A majority of the five-member FCC panel would have to vote in support of the rules before they could take effect.
