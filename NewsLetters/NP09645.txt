greater accountability in the Department
of Veterans Affairs, Marco demanded

Rubio Proposes Retirement Security
Reforms
On Wednesday, Marco introduced the
Let
Seniors Work Act of 2014 , legislation
to promote retirement security in the 21
st
century and incentivize
seniors to continue working past
retirement age if they choose to do so by
eliminating the 12.4 percent Social
Security payroll tax and repealing the
Retirement Earnings Test (RET).
Marco first outlined this idea during
a
speech Tuesday
at the National Press
Club, as part of his efforts to restore
the American Dream.
While our economy is rapidly
changing, retirement programs and
savings plans have failed to adjust
accordingly,
said Rubio . Currently,
seniors who have already paid their
fair share into Social Security are
being punished for choosing to keep
working rather than immediately cashing
in.
By eliminating the Social
Security payroll tax for seniors and
repealing the Retirement Earnings Test,
older people are incentivized to continue
working well into their golden
years,
Rubio continued . This
proposal would lift a financial strain
from an entire generation of hardworking
Americans, equipping them with the tools
needed to live out the American Dream
with comfort, dignity and peace of
mind.

Rubio Demands Answers After Alleged
Secret Waiting Lists Found In
Gainesville VA Center
Marco, the Senates original
sponsor of S. 2013, the
VA
Management Accountability Act of
2014
, issued the following statement
regarding a
new
report
about problems at the Veterans
Affairs (VA) hospital in Gainesville,
FL:
I am troubled by new reports
suggesting secret waiting lists were
being kept at the Gainesville VA
hospital, potentially to the detriment
of our veterans health. This
would be outrageous in its own right,
but its even more so because of
the pervasive problems emerging about
the VA each day in all corners of the
country.
Earlier this week,
I
asked VA Secretary Shinseki
for all
information regarding secret VA waiting
lists in Florida and Biloxi, MS. I
dont want to wait until
everything is ready. I want to see what
is available now, starting with
Gainesville.
It also highlights the need
to bring real accountability to the VA.
From problems in Phoenix to Miami and
now potentially Gainesville too,
weve seen plenty of
finger-pointing and excuses, but no one
actually being fired for incompetence
and negligence in the performance of
their duties. As an easy first step,
Congress should approve the VA reform
bill Congressman Jeff Miller and I have
introduced.
Rubio To Kerry: No More Mixed
Signals On Venezuela, Time For
Sanctions On Regime
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, is calling on the
Obama Administration to support targeted
sanctions on individuals involved in
human rights abuses and significant acts
of corruption in Venezuela.
In
a
letter to Secretary of State John
Kerry , Marco highlighted the
troubling committee hearing testimony by
Roberta Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of
State for Western Hemisphere Affairs on
May 8th. At the hearing, Jacobson
claimed the Administration is reluctant
to impose sanctions on human rights
abusers because Venezuelas
opposition had asked not to pursue these
measures at this time. However, hours
later, the leading Venezuelan opposition
group explicitly rejected the claim.
Either the State Department
made a mistake, or it is relying on
unfounded information as its basis for
opposing sanctions on Venezuelan regime
officials at this time,
wrote Rubio . In either
case, I am deeply troubled about the
mixed signals and message of impunity
the Administration is sending to the
Maduro regime and its enablers as its
repressive machine ramps up the
brutality of human rights abuses
inflicted on peaceful demonstrators,
including more than 240 students
arrested the morning of May 8
the same morning the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee examined these
matters.
I urge the administration to
publicly support the immediate
imposition of targeted sanctions on
individuals involved in human rights
abuses and outrageous cases of
corruption in Venezuela,
Rubio concluded .

Constituent Casework Corner
Mark, a resident of the Treasure
Coast, was traveling to Germany with his
family. When they arrived at the airport,
he was informed by the airline carrier
that they could not board the flight
because his daughters, who are minors,
require a passport with at least a
6-month validity date. Their passports
were only valid for 3 more months. Mark
booked them on a flight for the following
day and contacted Senator Rubios
office for assistance. A member of the
staff contacted the Miami Passport Agency
and they were able to provide an
expedited appointment to apply for a
renewal of their passports. The agency
completed the application and issued the
daughters new passports in time
for their flight the following day.
