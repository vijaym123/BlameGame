My thoughts are with Senator Boozman, his
wife, Cathy, and their family.
I am grateful John is receiving
care from some of Arkansass finest doctors and pray that he will make a
quick, full recovery so that he can get back to doing what he loves
and does so well
serving the people of
Arkansas.
ACADEMY DAYS
Each year, members of Congress have the privilege of
making nominations to the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAF), the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point (USMA), the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), and the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA).
Tomorrow, I am hosting the 2014 Academy Days as an
opportunity to provide additional information to students of the Third
District.
Young men and women who are interested in pursuing
appointments to the United States Service Academies, as well as those interested
in ROTC scholarships, are encouraged to attend.
I hope to see
you there!

EASTER RECESS
RECAP
Its been a busy Easter
Recess!
Last week, I traveled to the Middle East with
Speaker John Boehner and a group of senior House Members, including
Education and Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (MN-2), Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (WA-4), Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dave Camp (MI-4), Representative Tom Latham (IA-3),
Representative Devin Nunes (CA-22), and Representative Greg Walden
(OR-2).
The purpose of this trip was to engage
with U.S. government officials, foreign leaders, and the private
sector regarding current U.S. policies and strategies related to Iran and
Syria, as well as geopolitical trends with respect to transnational
terrorism and energy competition.
We also met with civilian and
military leaders to assess retrograde in
Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan, we visited
our troops, as well as Ambassador Cunningham and General
Dunford.
I even got to see Captain Aston Armstrong from Fort Smith!
I
appreciated this opportunity, especially in the wake of the pivotal
first round of voting, and the midst of the country's first-ever
democratic, peaceful transfer of political authority. Visiting personally
with ANSF forces has given me great hope that our nation's efforts have
been productive and the sacrifices made by coalition forces have not
been made in vain.
We also spent time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
a crucial
American ally in the Middle East
and in Turkey.
While in the UAE,
our group met with American and Emirates armed forces personnel at Al
Dhafra Air Base and visited the new Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi.
In
Turkey, we traveled to Ankara and Istanbul to meet with Turkeys
President, Abdullah Gul, the Speaker of the Turkish Grand National
Assembly, Cemil Cicek, and the Prime Minister, Tayyip Erdogan, to discuss
some of the biggest challenges the U.S. and its allies face in the world,
including Russias actions in Ukraine, the ongoing war in Syria, and
the continuing concerns about Irans nuclear
program.
Finally, our delegation headed to Portugal,
where we met with members of the Portuguese Parliament, Prime Minister
Pedro Passos Coelho, Foreign Minister Rui Machete, and U.S. Ambassador
Robert Sherman. From there, it was back to Northwest
Arkansas!
This Tuesday, after breakfast with the NWA
Home Builders Association and lunch with the Rogers Noon Rotary Club,
I hosted Coffee with the Congressman at Lowell City Hall.
Thank
you to the crowd who came! I enjoyed the coffee and the
company!
On Wednesday, I visited
University of Arkansas
Fort Smith (UAFS), where I joined Dr. Beran to
announce that Curtis B. Adams III, a member of the Class of 2014 and
the UAFS Student Government Association President, has been selected
to serve as the 2014 John Paul Hammerschmidt (JPH)
Fellow.
The JPH Fellowship,
named for former Arkansas Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt
(1966-1993), was established in 2013 in conjunction with UAFS.
It is
geared towards highly motivated college students with an interest in
public service and will allow outstanding Third District students to
experience the legislative process firsthand in my Washington, D.C.
office.
John Paul was dedicated to helping young leaders in our
community
like Curtis
grow professionally and personally, and I am
thrilled this fellowship can continue to honor his
legacy.
While in Fort
Smith, I also attended the Fort Smith Rotary Club weekly lunch and visited
Comprehensive Juvenile Services, Inc., the First Tee of Fort Smith,
and River Valley Pediatric Dentistry!
Each spring, a nation-wide high school arts competition is
sponsored by the members of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The competition was open to all high school students in the Third
District.
On Wednesday evening, I hosted an awards presentation to
announce this years winner:
Raiden Mayo from Siloam Springs High
School!
Congrats, Raiden!
His piece, Curiosity, will hang
in the U.S. Capitol for a year.
Dont forget, the 2014 Fan Favorite
Art Competition is still open!
You can vote for your favorite
piece on
my facebook
page .
Today, I joined Charlie Blanchard of First
State Bank at Sequoyah Elementary in Russellville to Teach Children to
Save! Established by the American Bankers Association (ABA) in 1997,
Teach Children to Save is a national campaign to organize volunteers in
an effort to educate young people about the importance of developing
lifelong savings habits.
While in Russellville, I stopped by ARVAC Freedom House for a tour and had
lunch with Corbin Zachary, a class of 2018 Air Force Academy
appointee.
Next week, its back to
Washington!
Thanks to all who made this work period so
productive.
Look forward to seeing you again
soon.
From the
Front...
