Dear Friend,
The most important part of my job is meeting with the people I have the
honor of representing in Congress. Hearing from my constituents
firsthand is where I discover the best ideas, not in a hearing room or
on the House floor. Over the past few weeks, I've been fortunate to
travel through our communities and learn about the issues that are most
important to you.
On April 25th, I visited the Huntington Yacht Club to announce my new
legislation, the BOATS (Boating Occupancy And Teaching Safety) Act,
which would require boats less than 45 feet in length to specify their
maximum safe weight and capacity limit, and also provide grants for
boating-safety classes. The idea for this legislation was a result of a
boating roundtable I hosted at Bayville Village Hall with local
boaters, boating community leaders and local law enforcement, where we
discussed how we could improve boating safety in the wake of a tragic
2012 incident that left three children dead after the boat they were on
capsized in Oyster Bay. I'm proud I was able to work with my
constituents to craft this common-sense bill.
Later that day, I toured the Quality Services for the Autism Community's
(QSAC) Preschool and Early Childhood Center in Douglaston, and spoke
with administrators, parents and students about how I can help support
children and adults with autism. I'm excited to continue working with
this special organization-their preschool facility is a shining example
of what can be accomplished when a devoted staff and loving families
work together to help autistic children reach their full potential.
I also hosted a veterans' casework seminar at the Glen Cove VFW Post
347 with Glen Cove Mayor Reggie Spinello and Kelly Chicko of the
Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA). The panelists discussed the
services available to our veterans and educated them on the claims
process. To date, my office has helped local veterans secure more than
$7.4 million in back payments from the VA. If you are a veteran who
needs help, or know one who does, please make my office your first
stop. We are here to help cut through the red tape.
As always, my office is here to help you with any federal issues you
may be facing. Please feel free to reach out to my office at (631)
777-7391
, (516) 505-1448
or (718) 875-1675
.

The

Hearing

where
I

Over

I&#8217;ve
been fortunate

The
idea

that
left
three
