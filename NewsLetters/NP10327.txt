ICYMI: Rubio: Five Things For
President Obama To Keep In Mind During
His Trip To Asia
On Thursday, Marco outlined five things
the President should consider during his
trip to Asia in an op-ed on
ForeignPolicy.com .
An excerpt of the piece is below:
Here are five things that the
president should keep in mind as he
visits Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and the
Philippines:
1. Reassure, Reassure, Reassure.
Given the security challenges facing
our allies in Asia, they are watching
with great concern the president's
reluctance to lead in the Middle East,
most notably in Syria. Added to this in
recent weeks has been Russia's annexation
of the sovereign territory of its
neighbor Ukraine, an unsettling move for
countries like the Philippines that face
daily threats from Beijing about
unresolved territorial disputes.
2. Don't let historical disputes
undermine cooperation.
While the president is visiting Japan
and South Korea, some will likely try to
draw him into the ongoing disputes
between the two countries over historical
issues. Despite the progress made
recently in trilateral talks among Obama,
President Park Geun-hye of South Korea
and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan
brokered by the United States, these
controversial topics simmer beneath the
surface.
3. Show real leadership on trade.
I saw firsthand during my trip the
impact of trade on our allies' economies
as well as our own. The U.S.-Korea Free
Trade Agreement, despite some issues with
implementation, has been a great success
and once the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) is concluded and other interested
nations are able to join, it will allow
us to further unite our economies,
creating commerce and business
opportunities for millions throughout
North America, South America, and
Asia.
4. Strengthen and improve
alliances.
In the Philippines, the president will
reportedly announce a framework agreement
that will allow a rotational U.S.
presence in that country. This will be a
huge boost to an ally that is
increasingly under pressure from Chinese
harassment in the South China Sea, and
will also be an important symbol of U.S.
commitment to the security of the
Philippines.
5. Speak frankly about China.
Even though China will not be on the
president's itinerary, it will be the
elephant in the room. Obama should speak
more frankly in public during his trip
about the U.S.-China relationship. The
administration's rhetoric about China has
added to the confusion and concern among
our allies in the region about the
direction of U.S. policy. Talk of a "new
model of major power relations" has
caused some to question whether
Washington is more interested in
negotiating over their heads with Beijing
than in standing by our allies.

Constituent Casework Corner
Laura, a resident of Central Florida,
recently met with Senator Rubios
staff at her local Mobile Office Hours. She
shared her concerns about the damaged
sidewalk in front of her residence and
feared a potential sinkhole was forming in
the area. A member of the staff reported
her concerns to state and local
representatives. In turn, they sent the
appropriate authorities to inspect the
area. After the investigation was
concluded, they confirmed it was not a sink
hole and the sidewalk was repaired.

IRS Warns of New Email Phishing Scheme
Falsely Claiming to be from the Taxpayer
Advocate Service
Recently the Internal Revenue Service
warned consumers to be on the lookout for a
new email phishing scam. The emails appear
to be from the IRS Taxpayer Advocate
Service and include a bogus case number.
The fake emails may include the following
message: Your reported 2013 income
is flagged for review due to a document
processing error. Your case has been
forwarded to the Taxpayer Advocate Service
for resolution assistance. To avoid delays
processing your 2013 filing contact the
Taxpayer Advocate Service for resolution
assistance. Recipients are directed
to click on links that supposedly provide
information about the "advocate" assigned
to their case or that let them "review
reported income." The links lead to web
pages that solicit personal
information.
Taxpayers who get these messages should
not respond to the email or click on the
links.
Instead, they should forward the
scam emails to the IRS at
phishing@irs.gov .
For more information, visit the IRS's
Report Phishing web page at
http://www.irs.gov/uac/Report-Phishing
or call (800)829-1040.
