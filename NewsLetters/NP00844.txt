Dear
Friend,
During this
District Work Period, I was able to visit some outstanding innovators
at the United States Air Force Academy's Center of Innovation,
celebrate a major milestone in the history of the Royal Gorge Bridge, and
participate in the National Day of
Prayer.
The National Day of Prayer is such an important
day to the spiritual health of our nation. I was honored and blessed
to be surrounded by so many prayer warriors as I attended events
throughout Colorado Springs.
Please let me know if you require any assistance with a federal
government agency by contacting my local office at (719)
520-0055.
I am honored to serve as
your Representative in
Washington.
Sincerely,
MAY DISTRICT WORK
PERIOD
Thank you to KVOR's Richard Randall for
hosting our monthly Radio Telephone Town Hall meeting. We covered
many important topics with listeners including: how my office can help
veterans receive the care they have earned, the NDAA and Budget
processes, and more.
I paid a visit to the United
States Air Force Academy's Center of Innovation. This unique facility
leverages an innovative public/private partnership to conduct work on
the cutting edge of physics and technological R&amp;D. Thank you to
Lt. Colonel Greg Bennett and the dedicated and talented team at the COI.
For more information on the Center of Innovation, please click

I was also able to chat with Cadet Third-Class Min Je Kim, an
outstanding young man I nominated to the Air Force Academy two years
ago.
It was fantastic sharing prayer time with so many passionate
citizens in Colorado Springs during the National Day of Prayer. The
morning started at Woodmen Valley Chapel with a gathering filled with
strong prayer and patriotic music. I was also honored to give the closing
prayer at the inaugural National Day of Prayer luncheon at Focus on the
Family. The event featured a powerful speech from Adolph Coors IV on
the importance of forgiveness. The evening concluded with a rousing
gathering at the Grace Bible Church. This was
a powerful event
featuring a strong presence of believers from all over the globe. Thank
you to everyone who participated and prayer for our
nation!
It was a
tremendous honor to speak at the Grand Re-Opening of the Royal Gorge
Bridge and Park. A soggy day did not dampen the enthusiasm of over 500
attendees who were tremendously excited to see a new and improved
landmark that has been a vibrant tourist attraction for 86 years. The
2013 fire burned over 3,000 acres and destroyed over 90 percent of the
park's attractions. I want to commend and thank everyone involved
in the rebuilding effort. In the face of such adversity, you have
come together and rebuilt, ensuring that Royal Gorge Bridge and Park
will remain a crown jewel attraction for future
generations.
With Fremont County's own Miss Colorado, Baylee
Marchiani
SPEAKING OUT FOR THE
UNBORN
I joined Tony Perkins on the Family Research
Council Washington Watch radio program to discuss the Pain-Capable
Unborn Child Protection Act. The Congressman is a co-sponsor of this
legislation designed to outlaw abortions at 20 weeks
post-fertilization or later, protecting babies from severe pain leading to
death. Fetal pain legislation is based on a growing body of irrefutable
scientific data and physical evidence of fetal
pain.

More information on the Pain-Capable
Act
Protecting unborn babies from
painful late
abortions
In cases of excepted abortions, this bill requires
abortionists to use the means most likely to result in the live birth of the
child.
A second physician
trained in fetal resuscitation is required to be present and to care
for babies born alive, and to transport them to hospitals for medical
care.
Scientific Evidence
Scientific evidence reveals that unborn babies can feel pain by 20
weeks post-fertilization, and likely, even earlier. By that point,
unborn babies have all of the anatomy in place to feel pain.
Anniversary
of Gosnell
conviction
This week marks the two-year anniversary of the conviction
of late-term abortionist Kermit
Gosnell
Gosnells illegal, unsafe and gruesome abortion
practices resulted in his conviction
Exceptions and reporting
requirements
The bill contains an
exception for cases in which the life of the mother is at risk, and in
cases in which the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest with a
minor.
This bill does not
mandate a report to law enforcement .
Instead, the
bill empowers and cares for women who are victims of rape by requiring
counseling or medical care from a non-abortion facility at least 48
hours prior to the abortion
procedure.
Minors who are victims of rape or incest are protected by
requiring the abortionist to inform social services
or
law
enforcement in order to guard against potential ongoing abuse of
girls.
The bill upholds state
reporting requirements.
Punishes abortionists, not
mothers
The bill punishes abortionists who
knowingly perform an abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization with
up to five years in jail.
The bill explicitly protects a woman who has an abortion from any
prosecution, and gives her (or parents of a minor) a private right of
action to seek relief if the abortionist violates this
bill.
Abortionists have to provide an annual report
to the National Center for Health Statistics, under the CDC, with
details on all excepted abortions performed. This will be released by the
CDC as a public report
annually.
