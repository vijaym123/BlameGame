CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER ON FOX
NEWS:
WILL IRAN CHANGE?
Have you ever
celebrated "Death to America Day?"
The people of Iran do, every
November 4th.
Iran continues to be a state
sponsor of terrorism,
continues to call America the
"Great Satan,"
continues to call for the annihilation of
Israel.
So why are we supposed to
celebrate a tentative agreement that still provides Iran with a path to
nuclear weapons?
Click here to watch my full interview
on Fox News Channel's "On the
Record" from Friday, April
3rd.
Despite the existential threat to the United States, we gave
one concession after another.
The paradigm shifted from "Iran will
be allowed no nuclear capacities" to "We will temporarily slow Iran's
path to a nuclear weapon."
Iran won at the negotiating
table because our team was just too eager to strike a deal
.
. . any deal, even if it was harmful to our national
security.
During an interview last week on Fox News, I asked a simple
question.
Does President Obama and his team think Iran will be
a different country tomorrow than it was yesterday?
Will Iran renounce terrorism?
As Chairman of the
Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, I am committed
to working with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to challenge this
agreement.
The President has made his statement, and we will make
our statement.
If you have questions about the impact of
the tentative nuclear agreement with Iran, or would like to discuss
other legislative issues, or need assistance resolving an issue with a
federal agency, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Feel free to
call, stop by one of my offices in
Charlotte ,
Union County , or
Mooresville ,
or simply reply to this e-mail.
