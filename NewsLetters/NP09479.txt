QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Ed on Obama's assault against affordable
electricity: "This rule to protect fish comes on the heels of thirty
year 'take' permits that were provided to the wind industry to kill
birds, which is another example of how this President rewards his
political contributors and punishes those who disagree with him," said
Whitfield. "I am concerned this rule, in addition to the rules that
have contributed to an unprecedented number of coal plant shutdowns,
will threaten the reliability of our nation's power grid and the
affordability of energy. I will continue to fight President Obama's
radical agenda and ensure the EPA's regulatory assault does not go
unchecked."
