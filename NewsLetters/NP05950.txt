I'm not going to sit by and let the Republicans buy this election. Will you chip in $5 or whatever you can right now to turn this election around? (If it helps, I'll beg too.)

We're out of people to email you.
In the last week, you should have received an email from:
-- President Obama
-- Vice President Biden
-- Hillary Clinton
-- Nancy Pelosi
We&rsquo;re not making this stuff up. Control of Congress is at stake. The biggest fundraising deadline of the election is this week. Our numbers will be public. And we're dangerously behind.
We need 66OO more donations in the next 6 hours if we want any shot at giving President Obama a Democratic House for his final two years.
David Johnson Answered President Obama's Call-to-Action? NO DONATION
We're begging, David. Can you answer the President's call-to-action today? 48-HOUR DEADLINE: All Gifts Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
