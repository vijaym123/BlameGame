Dear Friend,
My father
was a Georgia State Trooper. He instilled in me respect for the law.
Last week, during National Police Week, the entire country got a chance
to celebrate the men and women who make it their jobs. In Washington, I
said thank you, personally, to two outstanding Northeast Georgia
sheriffs -- Jackson County Sheriff
Janis Mangum
and
Stephens County Sheriff
Randy
Shirley .
On Capitol Hill, we participated in a
Google video hangout
with Rep. Dave Reichert,
a sheriff himself from Washington State , as well as police
officers from around the country. We talked about some unfortunate episodes
of antagonism towards law enforcement and how Congress could help
support officers. Just this week, House Republicans passed a national
"Blue Alert" system to more quickly identify perpetrators of anti-police
violence.

Also recently, I introduced
two of my own bills. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Self-Defense
and Protection Act would allow federal officers to continue to carry
their firearms in the event of a lapse in government funding. The
Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act would provide more mental
health training to local officers to help protect them from harm. It would
create special veterans courts and other programs to divert returning
soldiers from county jails into treatment for combat-related stress
disorders.
Please read more about my
mental health bill -- just one of the ways I'm working in Congress to
support police --
in Red Alert Politics . In addition,
I regularly meet with Ninth District sheriffs to learn about their
needs. Already this year, I've met with most of them. And of course,
sheriffs from Jackson and Stephens Counties. I'm glad I got the chance to
see Sheriffs Mangum and Shirley in the capital -- and am even happier
these dedicated professionals are patrolling the Ninth
District.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
