Subject: Quick election update
Friends,
I wanted to send you a quick election update. Here's what we know: as of today, it is being reported that there are still over 100,000 ballots that have not been counted in Sacramento County, and we expect the majority of them to be from the 7th District. We have also been told that the Registrar of Voters will begin counting ballotstomorrowmorning.
When I was elected in 2012, I was in a virtual tie with Dan Lungren on election night. When the tens of thousands of late ballots were counted, we won by over 9,000 votes. Even in 2010, we picked up thousands of votes as the final numbers rolled in. While we can't predict what will happen over the coming weeks, we feel confident that many of the remaining ballots will go our way.
Here's why we need help today:we're hiring the best legal team in America, just like we did in 2012. We estimate that the ballot counting may take up to three weeks, and we will likely need to raise $100,000 to ensure a proper count. Yesterday, you helped us raise the initial resources to hire our legal team and make sure we are ready to gowhen counting begins tomorrow. Now, we have to raise the remaining resources to cover the costs. I hope we can count you in.

Friends,
Good news: ballots are being counted and we&#39;re making up ground.
Just today, we closed the margin by 828 votes -- and it&#39;s estimated there are 79,000 ballots left to be counted in Sacramento County.
We still have a long way to go, but this is why it is critical that each and every vote is counted.
You can help us make sure every voice is heard by chipping in today -- can we count on you? Please click here.
As the race tightens, it&#39;s more and more likely we&#39;ll see a recount, and your support is needed.
We&#39;ll keep you updated as we know more.
Thanks,
Team Bera
