Saluting the Fallen and Supporting the Living
Dear Friends,
This Memorial Day weekend we must honor and remember those who have fallen in battle defending our country and our freedom. I want to especially thank Wyoming families and families all over the country whose relatives, sons and daughters, paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.
In addition to those who served and died in battle, there are soldiers returning that are bearing the scars of battle. Many of these soldiers are suffering from PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and other injuries or conditions that prevent them from easily reentering civilian society. I met this week with Jordyn Hatfield of Jackson, Wyoming who is caring for five soldiers who are suffering from these conditions. These caregivers deserve our thanks and praise and these soldiers deserve our thanks and our attention. We need to make sure these soldiers have an opportunity to reunite with their families and reenter normal family life that allows them to continue this great American life.
Sincerely,
