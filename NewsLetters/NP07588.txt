Good morning, David.
I know it&rsquo;s early, but this is important. Just this month:
A top election forecaster called our race a &ldquo;pure toss up.&rdquo;
Republican Bob Dold announced his strongest fundraising quarter yet.
A poll showed the margin in our race to be razor-thin.
So let me be absolutely clear:
this race will go down to the wire.
Winning depends on the tenacity of grassroots supporters like you. It depends on our ability to get out the facts and spread our message --
plain and simple. David, if you&rsquo;ll fight for me, please chip in today and help win my first re-election campaign. I&rsquo;d truly appreciate it.
