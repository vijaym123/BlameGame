Wyomings Wolves, Wyomings Minerals
Dear Friends,
This week saw the introduction of two bi-partisan bills that are critical to our state: a mineral royalty bill and a wolf bill.
On the bipartisan mineral royalty bill, I am leading the charge in the U.S. House while Senator Enzi and Senator Barrasso are championing it in the Senate.
This bill would restore millions of dollars that would be going to Wyoming but was taken by the federal government citing administrative costs.
Our bill would give states like Wyoming the option to collect and disperse their own mineral royalties, which would keep Wyomings money in Wyomings borders and restore to our state the 2% that the federal government is charging.
The bipartisan wolf bill that I introduced with Rep. Ribble (R-WI) would return the gray wolf to state management in both Wyoming and in the Western Great Lakes region, as provided for under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rulemakings.
The science speaks for itselfthe gray wolf in Wyoming and the Western Great Lakes are fully recovered.
I think it is high time to codify these federal rulemakings, recognize what should be a conservation success story, and return wolf management to the states capable hands.
Please feel free to share your thoughts and concerns with me on these or other issues.
Sincerely,
This mailbox is unattended.
