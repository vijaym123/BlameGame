Dear David,
My mom and I used to talk a lot about what it's like to grow older in America. Driving to doctors' appointments, sorting through Medicare payments - she spoke bluntly about the struggles seniors face.
And among the many holes her death left in my life - one is that I lost a candid barometer of what life is like for older Americans.
So as I've recently taken the top-ranking Democratic spot on the U.S. Senate's Committee on Aging, it's critical for me to get that same perspective from folks in Missouri.
That's why I traveled the state last week on my " Show Me Seniors Tour " to hear from seniors on the issues that affect their lives.
View photos, tweets and video from my tour across Missouri.
From Kansas City to Farmington,
Chillicothe
to Branson, I heard from folks who reminded me that my mom's experience wasn't unique.
In
Farmington
and
Macon , I heard about the negative effects of the Missouri State Legislature's refusal to expand Medicaid - turning away Missourians' own tax dollars, and forcing the closure of rural hospitals. In
Branson , I heard from folks whose financial security has been threatened by scam artists through fraudulent calls.
And in St. Louis, I spoke with researchers and physicians about the importance of maintaining our competitive edge in medical research for Alzheimer's - research that's critical to advancements in health and wellness and to Missouri's economy.
Unfortunately, elected Republicans who now run Congress have different priorities. Under their budget, more than 100,000 Missouri seniors would pay more for expensive prescriptions - re-opening the so-called "donut hole." And the budget would force nearly 900,000 Missouri seniors out of traditional Medicare and into a voucher program.
We owe so much to our parents' generation, and I finished my tour with renewed vigor - to protect Medicare and Social Security, and to stand up and fight scam artists, and those elected officials who want to endanger the benefits our seniors have earned.
All the best,
P.S. Whether I'm fighting for Missourians in the Senate or back home, stay connected with me on
