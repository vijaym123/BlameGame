JAXPORT Harbor Deepening Gets Boost from Army Corps Funds
The Army Corps of Engineers has allocated $2.25 million in its 2014
Work Plan for the Preconstruction, Engineering, and Design (PED) phase
of the JAXPORT harbor deepening project. And, looking ahead to 2015,
the President's Budget contains a $3.15 million request in Army Corps
funds to continue the PED - all represent a strong boost for JAXPORT
and the Northeast Florida regional economy.
Deepening the St. Johns River means more jobs, more trade, and more
economic growth for the region. That's why I supported the 2014 funding
and will strongly support the 2015 request as it moves through
Congress.
Flood Insurance Reform Provides Protection Against Steep Premium
Increases
Millions in Florida and across the nation are on the road to certainty
and fairness when it comes to flood insurance thanks to House passage
of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (H.R. 3370).
On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues in supporting reforms that deliver
protection from skyrocketing premiums while preserving the transition
to true-risk premium rates over a more gradual time frame. Without
these changes, property owners would face outrageous premium hikes and
an already fragile housing market would be further threatened - an
unacceptable outcome in these difficult economic times.
Unlike the Senate version of flood insurance reform legislation, the
House bill is fully paid for, will not add a dime to our debt or
further burden taxpayers, and it's retroactive through October 1, 2013.
Americans deserve these strengths, and I strongly recommend they be
retained in the final bill.
Obamacare Individual Mandate Tax Penalty Drops to Zero Under House
Simple Fairness Act
When businesses get a delay in the enforcement of employer mandate
penalties, it's only fair that hard-working individuals and families
get the same. That's why I voted a 50th time on Wednesday to dismantle
Obamacare. The result: the individual mandate penalty drops to zero
dollars for the remainder of the year.
The Administration has fumbled Obamacare from the start. With a month
left to go in open season, they are far short of a projected 7 million
enrollees. That doesn't even take into consideration a malfunctioning
web site, high insurance premiums, and constant problems and delays.
There's a lot more work ahead for those of us who want to repeal a law
that has not delivered on its promises, and we are not giving up. I
strongly urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and quickly pass
the repeal of the individual mandate for the year.
Jacksonville National Cemetery Carillon Bell Tower Dedicated on March 1
The careful work behind the new Carillon bell tower at the Jacksonville
National Cemetery is a strong testament to the support the people of
the First Coast have for our veterans.
I was honored to join in
dedicating the tower on March 1, and know all who visit there will
welcome its ring during ceremonies on the cemetery's hallowed ground.
Making sure this sacred space best honors our veterans and provides
comfort to their families and loved ones remains center stage for me
and so many others. Moving ahead, I am working together with the
Veterans Memorial Center - Jacksonville National Cemetery Project
Leadership Team to take steps to allow for the construction of a Center
on cemetery grounds.
But, before that work can take place, an extended use lease (EUL) from
the National Cemetery Administration is needed. To accomplish that
goal, I have introduced legislation (H.R. 4141) to allow EULs for
organizations that support the mission of the Veterans Administration
so they can build on land that cannot be used as burial ground at
national cemeteries.
The Jacksonville National Cemetery Memorial Center will give 7,000
veterans and their families much-needed services that are not given at
any of our current national cemeteries.
A commemorative hall and
archive building will provide families of the fallen dedicated spaces
to gather and honor their loved ones. The Center would also provide a
place for the general public to learn more about those who have fought
for our great nation.

That&#8217;s

Obamacare
Individual

Tax
Penalty
Drops

House
Simple

Act
When
businesses
get

That

Jacksonville
National
Cemetery
Carillon
Bell
Tower
Dedicated
on
March
1
The
careful
work
behind
the
new
Carillon
bell
tower
at
the
Jacksonville
National
Cemetery
is
a
strong
testament
to
the
support
the
people
of
the
First
Coast
have
for
our
veterans.
I
was
honored
to
join
in
dedicating
the
tower
on
March
1,
and
know
all
who
visit
there
will
welcome
its
ring
during
ceremonies
on
the
cemetery&#8217;s
hallowed
ground.
Making
sure
this
sacred
space
best
honors
our
veterans
and
provides
comfort
to
their
families
and
loved
ones
remains
center
stage
for
me
and
so
many
others.
Moving
ahead,
I
am
working
together
with
the
Veterans
Memorial
Center
&#8211;
Jacksonville
National
Cemetery
Project
Leadership
Team
to
take
steps
to
allow
for
the
construction
of
a
Center
on
cemetery
grounds.
But,
before
that
work
can
take
place,
an
extended
use
lease
(EUL)
from
the
National
Cemetery
Administration
is
needed.
To
accomplish
that
goal,
I
have
introduced
legislation
(H.R.
4141)
to
allow
EULs
for
organizations
that
support
the
mission
of
the
Veterans
Administration
so
they
can
build
on
land
that
cannot
be
used
as
burial
ground
at
national
cemeteries.
The
Jacksonville
National
Cemetery
Memorial
Center
will
give
7,000
veterans
and
their
families
much-needed
services
that
are
not
given
at
any
of
our
current
national
cemeteries.
A
commemorative
hall
and
archive
building
will
provide
families
of
the
fallen
dedicated
spaces
to
gather
and
honor
their
loved
ones.
The
Center
would
also
provide
a
place
for
the
general
public
to
learn
more
about
those
who
have
fought
for
our
great
nation.
