Forbes Introduces Legislation to Protect Military Commissaries
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) introduced the Military Commissary Sustainment Act ( H.R.4217 ) to prohibit funding reductions for the defense commissary system in FY 2015, pending a report of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission:
The Presidents budget request proposes to eliminate support for our defense commissaries, one of the military familys most valued benefits. Such a cut would raise prices and reduce the savings to our military families, Congressman Forbes said. Reducing commissary service is essentially cutting the pay of those who volunteer to wear this nations uniform and is an unacceptable breach of faith with our warriors and their families. My legislation will prevent any such reductions in the coming year, removing yet another burden that our servicemembers and their families would have to face.
