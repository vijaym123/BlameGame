Rep. Miller Votes to Exempt Volunteer Fire Departments from Costly Obamacare Mandate
Washington
&#8211;U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after voting for legislation (H.R. 3979) she cosponsored to exempt local volunteer fire departments from the costly Obamacare employer mandate:
&#8220;Communities, both in Michigan and across the country, rely on the emergency services provided by our volunteer firefighters and first responders.
Many of these departments are already stretching their limited resources for equipment, training and recruitment.
Forcing them to comply with the employer mandate would have a crushing impact on the life-saving services they provide their local communities.
&#8220;This legislation provides them with a permanent exemption from the costly mandate, preserving their ability and willingness to continue to serve their community. I am extremely grateful for their brave service, and I am committed to ensuring they have the
resources necessary when they selflessly put their safety on the line for ours.&#8221;
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act (H.R. 3979):
Since the IRS has a history of treating volunteer firefighters as &#8220;employees&#8221; for tax purposes, there is concern that the IRS could treat these volunteers as employees for purposes of the employer mandate under Obamacare.
The employer mandate requires that
businesses with over 50 employees working at least 30 hours a week must provide employees with healthcare or face penalties. This mandate would likely require local forces to reduce their emergency response activities. H.R. 3979 amends the definition of &#8220;full-time
employee&#8221; in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to ensure that qualified volunteers, including voluntary firefighters and emergency responders, are not counted for determining the number of full-time employees or full-time equivalents at a given employer for
the purposes of the employer mandate.
