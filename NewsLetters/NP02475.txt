U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper made the following statement in advance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint session of Congress:
Iran is the most dangerous state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and I appreciate a leader who recognizes the threat that exists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has correctly stated that Iran must never be allowed to build a nuclear weapon, said Harper. America and Israel should have a shared goal to do whatever is necessary to prevent the threats we face from Iran and radical Islam. Why does our President insist on making a deal with Iran, a country that seeks to destroy both America and Israel? Iran has proven time and time again that it cannot be trusted.
