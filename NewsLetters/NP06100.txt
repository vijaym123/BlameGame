We have never seen it this bad:
When President Obama emailed you this morning, we expected most of our supporters to step up. In fact, we thought by now we would be on our way to crushing 2 MILLION donations this year. We were planning on celebrating breaking that record and sticking it to Boehner! Well, none of that happened.
And now we are scrambling. At the very least, we need 6,457 people to answer President Obama's call-to-action immediately. If we don't get there by tonight, John Boehner's ad blitz will go unanswered. That could be the death knell in our efforts to stop Boehner.
At this point, only you can save the day -- and the election.
