Dear Friend,
There has been much attention recently about the threat of the Islamic
State terrorist group and conflict in Syria and Iraq.
This is a very
real threat and one we must take seriously.
Yet as a response, the
President requested that Congress approve a proposal to train and equip
"moderate" Syrian rebels.
Congress rubber stamped this proposal, and
in doing so, gave tacit support for the Administration's bewildering
Middle East policies.
I did not support the amendment, as I feel we
must carefully reevaluate our approach to the Middle East, and there is
a significant risk of mission creep with the latest Administration
strategy.
Just last year, Secretary Kerry testified that we should intervene
against the Assad regime, despite it clearly not being a threat to
America nor of vital national security interest. As it turns out, such
strikes may have actually made the threat of ISIL worse than it is now.
When he testified before the House Armed Services Committee in
September 2013, I asked him whether the President supported the Powell
Doctrine as a guide for deciding when to take our nation to war.
Secretary Kerry could not provide a clear answer, but promised to
deliver to me a list of the principles of war and the foreign policy
doctrine of the Administration within twenty four hours.
A year
later, he has failed to do so, and the Administration's strategy is so
confusing that even the top administration officials cannot identify it.
For example, this past Thursday, Defense Secretary Hagel testified that
"we are at war and all options are on the table." The statement was
followed by a release from the White House quoting the President that
"as your Commander in Chief, I will not commit you and the rest of our
Armed Forces, to fighting another ground war in Iraq".
To add to this confusion, it is perplexing how the President can call
for additional missions while we are cutting back our military. The
drastic cuts to our defense budget, which is the only area this
Administration seems comfortable cutting, are a self-inflicted wound
and perhaps a bigger threat to our national security than any external
threat.
Foreign military interventions are always costly, in lives and in
money.
We cannot take responsibility for a problem when nations in the
Middle East stay on the sidelines and when the Iraqi military, which we
invested so heavily in, disintegrates.
The United States has been at
war in Iraq and Afghanistan longer than most of those that we are
fighting have been alive.
The fight among Sunni and Shia has been much
longer; it started in the Seventh Century.
It has been so brutal that countries like Saudi Arabia are considered
moderate.
They practice Sharia law, and multiple sources suggest the
Saudis beheaded 8 people last month.
Conversion from Islam to any
other faith is punishable by death, a disagreement on how to practice
Islam recently landed a Shia Muslim 1000 lashes and a 10 year prison
sentence in Saudi Arabia. This is where we will now train approximately
5,000 "moderate" Syrian Rebels to take on ISIL, at least that is what
the vote was for Wednesday.
I am not for taking an isolationist approach, we must defeat ISIL.
However, we seem overly focused on immediate threats while potential
adversaries, like Iran, Russia, and China, are rapidly approaching
military parity as a result of our failure to modernize our
capabilities and properly prioritize how we use our forces.
Rather
than continue to cut our military, we need to get our fiscal house in
order by addressing the real drivers of our national debt, entitlement
spending.
Not doing so is actually one of the most serious national
security challenges we face.
When we do decide to use our military, it is important that we act
decisively, rather than the Administration's tepid approach.
My
grandfather, a B-17 pilot and POW in WWII, would advise me "now, if you
have not made the decision to do what it takes to win the war then don't
go- you will just get more people killed.
Now, once you have decided
to win, get in, get it done, and come home."
If I were to speak to him about the Administration's foreign policy
strategy, I'm certain he would give me the same feedback he often did
on the farm when pulling in to check on the bulls.. "Smells like money".
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
There
has
been
much
attention
recently
about
the
threat
of
the
Islamic
State
terrorist
group
and
conflict
in
Syria
and
Iraq.
This
is
a
very
real
threat
and
one
we
must
take
seriously.
Yet
as
a
response,
the
President
requested
that
Congress
approve
a
proposal
to
train
and
equip
&#8220;moderate&#8221;
Syrian
rebels.
Congress
rubber
stamped
this
proposal,
and
in
doing
so,
gave
tacit
support
for
the
Administration&#8217;s
bewildering
Middle
East
policies.
I
did
not
support
the
amendment,
as
I
feel
we
must
carefully
reevaluate
our
approach
to
the
Middle
East,
and
there
is
a
significant
risk
of
mission
creep
with
the
latest
Administration
strategy.
Just
last
year,
Secretary
Kerry
testified
that
we
should
intervene
against
the
Assad
regime,
despite
it
clearly
not
being
a
threat
to
America
nor
of
vital
national
security
interest.
As
it
turns
out,
such
strikes
may
have
actually
made
the
threat
of
ISIL
worse
than
it
is
now.
When
he
testified
before
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
in
September
2013,
I
asked
him
whether
the
President
supported
the
Powell
Doctrine
as
a
guide
for
deciding
when
to
take
our
nation
to
war.
Secretary
Kerry
could
not
provide
a
clear
answer,
but
promised
to
deliver
to
me
a
list
of
the
principles
of
war
and
the
foreign
policy
doctrine
of
the
Administration
within
twenty
four
hours.
A
year
later,
he
has
failed
to
do
so,
and
the
Administration&#8217;s
strategy
is
so
confusing
that
even
the
top
administration
officials
cannot
identify
it.
For
example,
this
past
Thursday,
Defense
Secretary
Hagel
testified
that
&#8220;we
are
at
war
and
all
options
are
on
the
table.&#8221;
The
statement
was
followed
by
a
release
from
the
White
House
quoting
the
President
that
&#8220;as
your
Commander
in
Chief,
I
will
not
commit
you
and
the
rest
of
our
Armed
Forces,
to
fighting
another
ground
war
in
Iraq&#8221;.
To
add
to
this
confusion,
it
is
perplexing
how
the
President
can
call
for
additional
missions
while
we
are
cutting
back
our
military.
The
drastic
cuts
to
our
defense
budget,
which
is
the
only
area
this
Administration
seems
comfortable
cutting,
are
a
self-inflicted
wound
and
perhaps
a
bigger
threat
to
our
national
security
than
any
external
threat.
Foreign
military
interventions
are
always
costly,
in
lives
and
in
money.
We
cannot
take
responsibility
for
a
problem
when
nations
in
the
Middle
East
stay
on
the
sidelines
and
when
the
Iraqi
military,
which
we
invested
so
heavily
in,
disintegrates.
The
United
States
has
been
at
war
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
longer
than
most
of
those
that
we
are
fighting
have
been
alive.
The
fight
among
Sunni
and
Shia
has
been
much
longer;
it
started
in
the
Seventh
Century.
It
has
been
so
brutal
that
countries
like
Saudi
Arabia
are
considered
moderate.
They
practice
Sharia
law,
and
multiple
sources
suggest
the
Saudis
beheaded
8
people
last
month.
Conversion
from
Islam
to
any
other
faith
is
punishable
by
death,
a
disagreement
on
how
to
practice
Islam
recently
landed
a
Shia
Muslim
1000
lashes
and
a
10
year
prison
sentence
in
Saudi
Arabia.
This
is
where
we
will
now
train
approximately
5,000
&#8220;moderate&#8221;
Syrian
Rebels
to
take
on
ISIL,
at
least
that
is
what
the
vote
was
for
Wednesday.
I
am
not
for
taking
an
isolationist
approach,
we
must
defeat
ISIL.
However,
we
seem
overly
focused
on
immediate
threats
while
potential
adversaries,
like
Iran,
Russia,
and
China,
are
rapidly
approaching
military
parity
as
a
result
of
our
failure
to
modernize
our
capabilities
and
properly
prioritize
how
we
use
our
forces.
Rather
than
continue
to
cut
our
military,
we
need
to
get
our
fiscal
house
in
order
by
addressing
the
real
drivers
of
our
national
debt,
entitlement
spending.
Not
doing
so
is
actually
one
of
the
most
serious
national
security
challenges
we
face.
When
we
do
decide
to
use
our
military,
it
is
important
that
we
act
decisively,
rather
than
the
Administration&#8217;s
tepid
approach.
My
grandfather,
a
B-17
pilot
and
POW
in
WWII,
would
advise
me
&#8220;now,
if
you
have
not
made
the
decision
to
do
what
it
takes
to
win
the
war
then
don&#8217;t
go-
you
will
just
get
more
people
killed.
Now,
once
you
have
decided
to
win,
get
in,
get
it
done,
and
come
home.&#8221;
If
I
were
to
speak
to
him
about
the
Administration&#8217;s
foreign
policy
strategy,
I&#8217;m
certain
he
would
give
me
the
same
feedback
he
often
did
on
the
farm
when
pulling
in
to
check
on
the
bulls&#8230;.
&#8220;Smells
like
money&#8221;.
