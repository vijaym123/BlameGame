Dear Friend,
America's veterans have made every sacrifice to protect our country.
Although we can never fully repay the debt we owe our veterans, it is
our duty as a nation to fulfill our commitments to them. That is why I
wanted to let you know about a recent victory for the veteran community
- one that I am very proud to have been a part of.
In 2007, my first year in the Congress, a veteran-constituent contacted
my office for help with his application for Social Security benefits.
He had already received a 100 percent disability rating from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but had been waiting for years to
be approved for disability benefits from the Social Security
Administration (SSA), which required a completely separate application
process.
No one wants to put America's veterans through a bureaucratic
runaround, so I introduced legislation to streamline the process,
making it easier for disabled veterans to access their Social Security
benefits. Working directly with SSA Acting Director Carolyn Colvin, I
was recently able to announce new administrative protocols that will
fast-track disabled veteran claims. These changes will take effect on
March 17th.
For more information, please visit
http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pgm/disability-pt.htm
where you can read more
about the process. You can also check out a recent article the
Baltimore Sun wrote on the topic - Social Security to expedite veteran
disability claims
.
If you or a veteran you know needs assistance with Social Security
benefits or the VA, please contact my Towson Office at 410-832-8890. My
most important duty as a member of the House of Representatives is to
serve my constituents, and our country's veterans deserve the best
service we are able to give.
Sincerely,
John P. Sarbanes

Dear
Friend,
America&#8217;s
veterans
have
made
every
sacrifice
to
protect
our
country.
Although
we
can
never
fully
repay
the
debt
we
owe
our
veterans,
it
is
our
duty
as
a
nation
to
fulfill
our
commitments
to
them.
That
is
why
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
about
a
recent
victory
for
the veteran
community
&#8211;
one
that
I
am
very
proud
to
have
been
a
part
of.
In
2007,
my
first
year
in
the
Congress,
a
veteran-constituent
contacted
my
office
for
help
with
his
application
for
Social
Security
benefits.
He
had
already
received
a
100

disability

from
the
Department

but
had
been
waiting
for
years
to
be

for

from
the
Social

which
required
a

No
