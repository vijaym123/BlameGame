Friends,
The South Carolina Alliance To
Fix Our Roads held its annual meeting last week and I had the
privilege of speaking to the group about our districts infrastructure needs
and the upcoming federal Highway Bill.
There
is no question that our states roads need attention.
Crumbling infrastructure in South Carolina is frustrating; it lengthens
our travel time, endangers commuters, damages our cars and trucks,
and slows the movement of freight all of which negatively impact our
economy.
Our countrys Highway Trust Fund is running
out of money and Congress must find a way to fund our interstate,
highway, bridge, and road projects.
The Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, of which I am a member, has begun drafting a bill to
reauthorize our nations highway programs and address the sustainability
of the Highway Trust Fund.
Since joining the
Committee, I have shared time and time again the infrastructure needs of
our district and the necessity of multiple surface transportation
projectslike I-73, that when completed, will significantly boost our
economy and create jobs.
The most important issue
discussed at the Fix Our Roads meeting was how to fund our
infrastructure projects with limited resources.
The funding ideas
below were considered at the meeting and I would like to hear your
thoughts on these proposals.
Please take a minute to answer
the poll question below.
Which funding idea do you support the most?
Tax offshore drilling
revenues. Levy driver user
fees. Raise the federal gas
tax. None of the
above. Other: If you are having trouble, click here.

District
Visits
I enjoyed traveling around the
district this week and meeting with constituents in Loris, Darlington,
Hartsville, Georgetown, and Myrtle Beach.
Over numerous cups of
coffee, I sat down with constituents to discuss ISIS, border security,
the continuing resolution, and issues facing our community like
transportation projects and Atlantic Beach Bike Fest.
These meetings
are very beneficial and informative.
As Mr. Gregory Libscomb
commented on my
Facebook page , MBWA
(Management By Walking Around) is absolutely the best way to stay in touch
with reality and the issues that matter.
I could not agree more
and I look forward to more coffee sessions soon.
In the
meantime, here are a few pictures from the Coffee with Your Congressman events
last week:
Visiting with Our Communitys Future
Leaders
The 8th Grade Class at Ocean Bay Middle School
just launched their Careers and Leadership speaker series, and I
was honored to be their inaugural speaker.
I shared with these
bright young people the importance of our countrys Declaration of
Independence and the sacrifices our Founding Fathers made for each of us.
By setting up a democratic republic, rather than a kingdom, our
founders fostered an environment that promotes growth and competition.
We also discussed our nations checks and balances system and the
responsibilities of our countrys leaders.
The students were
quick to point out that every elected leaders top priority should be to
protect the people, our country, and our freedom.
I truly
enjoyed visiting with these students and was impressed by their
intelligence and willingness to learn.
Here are some pictures from the
visit:
As always, it
is an honor and privilege to represent you and your
family.
Have a good
week,
