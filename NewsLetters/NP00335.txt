Friend,
Seventy-one years ago today, the largest seaborne invasion in history began at Normandy in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944.
D-Day saw more than 5,000 ships, 11,000 airplanes, and 150,000 troops storm the beaches of Normandy
Northeastern Pennsylvania has a particular reason to be proud on D-Day. I had a visit from Dennis Ruddy, whose uncle, Gerard, was one of those unbelievably brave paratroopers who jumped into Normandy at the beginning of the action.
Please take six minutes and learn about this American hero who gave his life to keep us free.
We should never forget their sacrifices, and their bravery, which paved the way to an Allied victory in World War II.
Sincerely,
