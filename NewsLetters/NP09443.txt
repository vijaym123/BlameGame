Dear Neighbors,
On Monday, we celebrate Memorial Day and across the nation Americans
will gather to pay tribute to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines
who go overseas and do not return. They are from every state and
territory. They are from farms, ranches and cities. They are of all
races and both sexes. They are rich and poor, but generally they are
young. They are patriots, defenders of freedom and volunteers to serve
our great nation. We remember all of those who have paid the ultimate
sacrifice so that we can live freely.
Last week I helped welcome home over 250 Wounded Warriors at a dinner
to honor them. The event included many members of our community, JROTCs
from Humble ISD Atascocita High School Summer Creek High School and
Kingwood Park High school as well as Harris County Precinct 4
Constables Office. It was a great honor to be a part of such a
patriotic event and it was truly humbling to welcome these servicemen
and women home. We are all thankful for these selfless servants who put
themselves in harm's way to protect our freedom.

This Memorial Day, we remember those who served and who did not make it
back home.
On Monday, I will be honoring our fallen heroes at the
Houston National Cemetery, as Americans across the nation observe this
day of remembrance.
We remember their sacrifices and that of their
families. To those who gave their all to serve our country, America is
eternally grateful. We remember each and every one of them because the
worst casualty of war is to be forgotten.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT:
This week, the House unanimously passed my
bill, the bipartisan Justice for Victims' of Trafficking Act (HR 3530).
This bill implements a robust and aggressive strategy to help combat
human trafficking in our country. I urge the Senate to take up this
legislation and help end this scourge in our nation and in our hometown
of Houston. Click here

Dear
Neighbors,
On
Monday,
we
celebrate
Memorial
Day
and
across
the
nation
Americans
will
gather
to
pay
tribute
to
our
soldiers,
sailors,
airmen
and
Marines
who
go
overseas
and
do
not
return.
They
are
from
every
state
and
territory.
They
are
from
farms,
ranches
and
cities.
They
are
of
all
races
and
both
sexes.
They
are
rich
and
poor,
but
generally
they
are
young.
They
are
patriots,
defenders
of
freedom

to
serve
our
great
nation.
We
remember
all
of
those
who
have
paid
the

Last

I
helped
welcome
home
over
250
Wounded

a

honor
them.
The

included
many

It
was
a
great
honor
to
be
a
part
of
such
a
patriotic
event
and
it
was
truly
humbling
to
welcome
these

We
are
all
thankful
for
these
selfless

who
put
