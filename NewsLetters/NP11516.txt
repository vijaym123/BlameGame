Neighbor,
I hope you're doing well. Here's a quick update on what I've been
working on in Congress.
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
was established after the 2008 economic crisis. Its goal
is to prevent the worst financial practices that occurred last decade
from hurting consumers again.
Since its creation, the CFPB has helped hundreds of Washington state
servicemembers, families and small businesses who have been wrongly
denied financial protections. They should be applauded for their work.
Unfortunately, opponents of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
are still fighting it. These opponents know it'd be unpopular to try to
dismantle the CFPB, so instead they're doing everything they can to
slow it down. They've spent months proposing bills that add burdensome
red tape and paperwork to the Bureau's work.
I spoke out on the floor of the U.S. House against the latest
wrongheaded bill attacking the CFPB, H.R. 3193
. You can watch my remarks below:

the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
On December 28 of last year, unemployment insurance lapsed for 1.4
million Americans looking for work. As of this week, that number has
climbed to 2 million American workers, including 39,000 Washingtonians
and 200,000 veterans nationwide
.
This comes at a time when there are still three unemployed workers for
every job opening. The long-term unemployment rate is still higher than
it ever was during the recessions of the 1990s and 2000s.
I have been pressing my colleagues in Congress to renew unemployment
insurance, and I'll keep up. We shouldn't make things harder for our
neighbors who are looking to find work.
I've heard from many people who have been hit by the lapse in
unemployment insurance, but I'd like to hear from more. Please share
your story if you have been affected.
As always, please let me know your thoughts on any issue Congress is
considering. Your messages help shape the decisions I make.
Sincerely,
Denny Heck, Member of Congress

Neighbor,
I
hope
you're

Here's
a

on
what
I've
been

in
Congress.
CONSUMER

EMERGENCY
UNEMPLOYMENT
INSURANCE
On
December
28
of
last
year,
unemployment
insurance
lapsed
for
1.4
million
Americans
looking
for
work.

of
this
week,
that
number
has
climbed to
2
million
American
workers,
including
39,000
Washingtonians
and
200,000

nationwide .
This
comes
at
a
time
when
there
are
still
three
unemployed
workers
for
every
job
opening.
The
long-term
unemployment
rate
is
still
higher
than
it
ever
was
during
the
recessions
of
the
1990s
and
