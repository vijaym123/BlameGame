We just don't know what else to do:
-- the latest polls show that voters reject Tea Party Republicans&rsquo; extreme agenda
-- but we're getting outspent by 3-to-1
-- and now, Boehner and Rove are piling on with even more Obama-bashing smears The math is daunting: if we can't cut the Republican advantage THIS WEEK, our chances of beating Boehner's Republicans drop to zero.
That's why President Obama emailed you this week. And Nancy Pelosi. And Joe Biden.
David, tonight&rsquo;s fundraising deadline is our last chance to turn this thing around. We're pleading -- please chip in to President Obama's call to action right now.
