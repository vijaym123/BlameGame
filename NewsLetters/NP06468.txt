Friend,
You&#39;re amazing.
You&#39;ve helped us hit every goal we&#39;ve set, and this week, you did it again. Thank you.
I have to be honest. As outside groups spend millions of dollars attacking me,
I will need your help again over the next few weeks.
Just this Monday, we learned that another outside group has reserved $750,000 worth of ads in October. With our opponents spending millions, I know this will be a close race.
But I also know that I have something money can&#39;t buy: my grassroots supporters. You.
Thank you for your support.
Your generosity helped us reserve our television time for next week.
I won&#39;t lie.
I still need your help, and I will need it even more next week.
But for today, know that I am grateful for your support and faith in me.
Be well,
