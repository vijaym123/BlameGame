Dear Friends,
Congressman Hinojosa and other members of Congress
witness President Obama sign the WIOA Act
For over a
decade, the
Workforce Investment Act
has been overdue for
reauthorization. I am pleased to say that on July 9th both the House of
Representatives and the Senate presented overwhelming bipartisan support
for
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which
will improve the nations workforce development
system.
This bill has made groundbreaking changes for Americans to
ensure that everyone is receiving training and gaining skills
necessary to succeed in the workforce. In addition, it will provide support
for Americans with disabilities to enter the workforce and gain the
skills necessary to succeed.
Other benefits
of the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act include:
Modernizing and improving existing federal workforce
development programs
Helping workers attain skills for
21 st century jobs
Providing support to people
with disabilities to enter and remain in competitive, integrated job
settings
Fostering the modern workforce that evolving
American businesses rely on to
compete
The
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
includes
several key provisions from The Adult Education and Economic Growth Act,
which I introduced. In the area of adult education, this bill
integrates adult education and workplace skills, authorizes the integrated
English Literacy and Civics education program for Adult learners, and
expands access to postsecondary
education.
Today, there are currently millions of Americans looking for work and
employers with job opportunities that are unfilled due to the widening
skills gap. Those Americans will now be able to gain access to
workforce training to bridge the skills gap and help strengthen the American
economy.In the 15 th
Congressional District of Texas, we
have seen how these programs are successful in training our workforce
and getting our residents back into good paying
jobs.
This bipartisan, bicameral legislation acts as a prime
example of what Congress can accomplish by working together to fix a
broken workforce training program. The legislation was approved in the
House of Representatives by a vote of 415 to 6; it was approved by Senate
by a vote of 95-3. The House of Representatives and the Senate worked
together to reach a common goal: To help Americans get back to work.
Not only did this bill show strong bipartisan support, but also the
support of business groups, labor unions, state and local elected
officials, community colleges, workforce boards, adult education providers,
youth organizations, and civil rights
groups.
I look forward to working on further legislation to help
solve ongoing problems within the nation and within my
district.
Sincerely,
Ruben Hinojosa
Member of
Congress
