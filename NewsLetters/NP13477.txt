CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
December 20, 2013
This week the Senate considered several important
issues before adjourning for the holidays. The issue foremost in the
news was the Ryan-Murray Budget.
As I
announced earlier in the week,
I voted against cloture and voted
against the budget. While I commend Chairman Ryan in his efforts to
prevent another shutdown, I could not in good faith support the budget
bill. Included in the bill were retroactive cuts to military retirees
cost-of-living adjustments. While I do agree there should be
restructuring of the military retirement benefits, it should not touch those
veterans who have already earned and are relying on their pensions. Along
with the COLA cuts, the budget also included significant changes to the
Senate budget rules that would allow Senate Democrats to circumvent
the 60-vote threshold in order to pass a tax increase or increase
spending.
Our country is on an unsustainable path that cannot be
solved by forcing procedural changes or budgetary gimmicks dressed as
offsets that do nothing to change how much the federal government
is spending. Its time for us to be honest and to address the real
drivers of our debt -- out of control entitlements and slow economic
growth.
To hear more about my votes on the budget,
listen to my interview with Bill
LuMaye.
On Tuesday, I introduced a bill that would tackle real wasteful
spending by consolidating the Department of Labor and the Department
of Commerce into a single, new agency called the Department of Commerce
and the Workforce (DOCW). Combining offices with similar functions
within these two agencies is a common-sense approach that would reduce
wasteful spending, cut duplicative programs, and would streamline our
approach to comprehensive economic policy. Read more about the bill,
here .
Last year, I
introduced the Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act which the Senate
unanimously passed, leading to the State Department declaring the
Haqqani Network as a foreign terrorist organization. I am very pleased to
share that Senate Leadership included my amendment to the National
Defense Authorization Act, which calls on the Secretary of Defense to
issue a report outlining the Defense Departments strategy to disrupt and
degrade the Haqqani Networks activities and
finances.
Finally, I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. I
look forward to serving you and North Carolina in the new
year.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
