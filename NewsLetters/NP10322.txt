Dear
Friends,
On Tuesday night, I had the opportunity to join state and local
leaders to discuss the Kanawha Valley chemical leak and water crisis at a
town hall hosted by WCHS in South Charleston.
"Lessons
Learned from the West Virginia Water Crisis" also featured panelists such
as U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, West Virginia American Water President
Jeff McIntyre, Kanawha-Charleston Health Department Executive Director
Dr. Rahul Gupta, and West Virginia Department of Environmental
Protection Secretary Randy Huffman.
The town hall is available in
seven segments online at
http://www.wchstv.com/news/features/town-hall/
(scroll to the bottom of the
page for video links).
I have also asked the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for more information on its efforts to
determine a safe level of inhalation and skin exposure to
MCHM.
In a letter to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, I asked for a number
of questions to be answered, including whether the CDC considered the
health risks of exposure to MCHM through inhalation and direct skin
contact when preparing the 1 part per million screening
standard.
The Freedom Industries spill has made it clear that additional
information needs to be available for chemicals circulating in the
marketplace that may impact human health. In cases where that information
is not available, however, health officials should error on the side
of informing that public of the uncertainty, I wrote.
BEN FRANKLIN CAREER &amp; TECHNICAL
CENTER
I am a strong
supporter of technical education and believe that our state's technical and
career schools can help our students be successful in their chosen
fields.
This week I visited Ben Franklin Career &amp;
Technical Center in Dunbar, where I met with power and science students. In
the photo above, student
Robert McCallister
shows me a robot he built as part of the school's Power and Energy
class.
Thank you for
reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join
in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
