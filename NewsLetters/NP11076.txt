Dear Friend -
Thanks for taking the time to read this week's newsletter. Below you
will find an update on my latest work around the Third District and in
Washington, including a report on a local job fair I hosted and a
Congressional field hearing on workforce training I brought to southern
Nevada.
As always, do not hesitate to contact me
on any issue that concerns you or your
family. It remains an honor and a privilege to serve you in the House
of Representatives.
Sincerely,

Job fair, career skills workshop a success
My top priority is building a healthy economy and setting the
conditions for private sector companies to expand and add jobs.
Locally, I have focused those efforts on connecting Nevadans with the
tools and resources they need to find a new job or a better job. I
recently held a job fair and career skills workshop that brought
together more than 40 "looking to hire" local employers and out-of-work
Nevadans.
When I arrived at the job fair, more than 100 people were lined up at
the door ready to hand out resumes and learn about potential job
opportunities. The event also featured several career skills workshops
designed to teach job seekers critical interview and resume writing
skills which will increase their chances of being hired. I am hopeful
that this job fair helps some folks get interviews and maybe even
hired. To learn about legislation I am working on that will help create
jobs visit http://heck.house.gov/JobsEconomy
.
Career, technical education key to building strong workforce
Building a healthy, thriving economy starts with having a workforce
trained to do not only the jobs that currently exist, but jobs that are
going to exist in the future. I recently brought members of the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce, including committee chairman
Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, to the Third District for a field hearing
to examine career and technical education (CTE) and to highlight
successful CTE programs in the Clark County School District.
The hearing was held at Southwest Career and Technical Academy, a
recently-recognized school of excellence by Magnet Schools of America,
and featured a panel of expert witnesses including Southwest principal
Felicia Nemcek and Frank Woodbeck, Director of the Nevada Department of
Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation. The hearing made several
things very clear; career and technical education is improving overall
quality of education for our students and CTE is successful in making
our students career and college ready. As the committee moves forward
on CTE funding legislation, the testimony offered and input received at
the field hearing will help inform committee members as we work to
update and improve CTE programs.
Reminder: Don't forget to connect with me on social media
to keep up with the latest photos,
videos, and news highlighting my work on your behalf. I am on Facebook,
Twitter, and YouTube as Rep. Joe Heck.
My op-ed on career and technical education
Following the field hearing, I submitted an op-ed to the Las Vegas Sun
on the importance of career and technical education. The piece
highlights the success of CTE students in Nevada and how their
educational choices put them in a great position to fill the jobs of
the future. Here is an excerpt from the piece:
"Students enrolled in CTE programs are challenging themselves to learn
highly advanced and technical subjects that will help them fill
currently in-demand jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics,
there are about 4 million job openings across the nation. Among the top
industries looking to hire are professional and business services,
health care and social assistance. Additionally, we know that demand
for workers in the STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and
math - is rapidly increasing."

11th annual Veterans Stand Down a success
Every year US VETS, a national veterans service organization, holds a
"Veterans Stand Down" at the Cashman Center in Las Vegas. The purpose
of the event is to bring together local veterans service organizations
to offer support, resources, and assistance to the area's veterans.
According to a recent census, more than 850 homeless veterans are in
southern Nevada. These men and women served our country proudly, yet
they have no roof over their heads.
The Stand Down offers food, clothing, medical services, legal
assistance, and most importantly, a network of support, to these brave
individuals. In Congress, I have dedicated myself to reducing veterans
homelessness and have introduced a bill
that would allow vets to keep more of their housing
assistance allowance and therefore be able to stay in their homes.
Thanks for reading this week's newsletter.

Rep.
John
Kline

to
examine
career

education
(CTE)
and
to
highlight
successful

programs
in

Clark
County
School
District.
