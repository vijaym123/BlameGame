I was being dead serious when I said we&rsquo;d miss our goal last night.
We fell short. Despite emails from President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and myself&hellip;we just couldn&rsquo;t get it done.
It was one of the most aggressive fundraising goals we&rsquo;ve ever had. We even surpassed our initial goal of 1OO,OOO online donations in 5 days. But we were forced to raise our goal when we learned that Republican outside groups put in 12 million dollars at the very last-minute.
I&rsquo;m not giving up. And you shouldn't either, David.
We have one last chance to right this ship. To do it, we need 9 donors from 60659 zip code
to make a triple-matched donation by midnight. TRIPLE-MATCH EXTENSION: (for donations made TODAY ONLY) Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
