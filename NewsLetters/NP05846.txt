Friends,
In September, the Senate passed
with my support
a bill to
fund the government through December. The bill also included $500 million
to arm and train moderate Syrian forces to combat the growing
terrorist group, ISIL. ISIL has attracted a number of Western and U.S.
recruits and poses a very real threat to America and our allies. We cannot
afford to stand idly by as ISIL gains territory, bolsters its military,
and increases its influence in the region. The world needs American
leadership.
Unfortunately, the November elections have
distracted too many in Congress from doing the job we were sent here to
do.
I strongly object to Congress heading home to campaign
rather than staying to debate the presidents full strategy to combat and
ultimately eliminate this threat. I believe Americans deserve an open
and honest discussion about the full scope of our mission, and the
president should seek congressional authorization for a sustained air
campaign.

Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary
Chuck Hagel at an Armed Services Hearing about our strategy to combat
ISIL.

Pushing Back on
EPA
I worked with Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) to lead a
bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate in calling on the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to allow for additional time for Nebraskans
and all Americans to have a say on new energy regulations. I believe all
stakeholders should have more time to review this proposed carbon
emissions regulation, which could dramatically impact electricity
utilities in Nebraska and drive up costs for families. Im happy to report
that the EPA agreed to extend its comment and review period to December
1, 2014. You can post a comment

Keeping FCC
Accountable
Last week, I worked with a number of Western state Senators to
urge
the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to follow through with plans to investigate telephone
connection problems in rural areas. Nebraskans depend on consistent,
reliable telephone service to not only stay connected with friends and
family, but also to conduct business and ensure public safety.
The FCC unanimously adopted a rule to address telephone connection
issues in 2013, but it has not yet taken the necessary steps to allow the
process to continue. I intend to continue to hold the FCC accountable
on this important matter.
Expanding my
Outreach
In an effort to continue to improve access and
convenience for Nebraskans, Ive expanded my permanent office presence in the
state with staff in Kearney and Norfolk. This is in addition to my
offices in Omaha, Lincoln and Scottsbluff. Members of my staff and I will
continue to be out and about in different communities as well. Click
HERE
for a list of upcoming
local office ours. I encourage Nebraskans to reach out with any
problems they may be having with the federal government, or to share their
concerns. Im here to serve you.
