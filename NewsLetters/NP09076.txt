FEATURED STORY
New Era of Conservation Partnerships Begins in Great Lakes Region
During a visit to the Saginaw Bay area last week, U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Tom Vilsack joined Senator Stabenow to launch the new
Regional Conservation Partnership Program created in her bipartisan
2014 Farm Bill. The program will help provide opportunities for
businesses, non-profits, universities, and federal, state and local
governments to partner with agricultural and conservation groups to
invest in clean water, soil and wildlife conservation. On the same day,
the USDA designated the Great Lakes region as one of eight Critical
Conservation Areas across the country, making it eligible for
additional funding for clean water projects.

WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters Team Up to Cut Red Tape For Auto
Dealers and Consumers
A bipartisan bill that will eliminate redundant, outdated paperwork
requirements for auto dealers passed the Senate unanimously and awaits
the President's signature. The legislation means that auto dealers will
no longer have to provide certificates stating that vehicles conform to
federal emission standards, because all new models are required by law
to meet the standards. The bill was a joint effort by Senator Stabenow,
Co-chair of the Bipartisan Senate Manufacturing Caucus, and
Representative Gary Peters, Co-chair of the Congressional Auto Caucus.
"Cutting red tape is a win-win for Michigan small businesses and
consumers. Eliminating redundant paperwork is just common sense and
will allow our auto dealers to focus on selling cars and trucks and the
needs of their customers," Sen. Stabenow said. This is the second time
this year that Stabenow and Peters teamed up to help small business;
their Small Business Access to Capital Act, introduced with Senator
Levin, would build on the success of the State Small Business Credit
Initiative that has made nearly $70 million available to Michigan
businesses to help them access capital, expand operations, and create
jobs.

Habitat Restoration in the Great Lakes Region
Buoyed by $1.7 Million Grant
U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin announced support for the
Great Lakes Commission to lead a regional partnership focusing on
habitat restoration in the area. The new partnership, comprised of the
Great Lakes Commission and state and local agencies, will receive over
$1.7 million through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. The funding will continue work already under way as
part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. "Today's announcement
is another great victory for the Great Lakes, and it comes only a few
days after USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and I announced the new Regional
Conservation Partnership Program that will invest in clean water, soil
and wildlife conservation," said Stabenow. "Our Great Lakes are vital
to Michigan's way of life and economy, and this will strengthen our
efforts to protect them for future generations," she added.
