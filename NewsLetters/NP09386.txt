Dear
Friend,
This Memorial Day, as we take time to be with friends and family,
its important to remember why we are blessed with these
freedoms.
Since before our countrys founding, whenever
tyranny or oppression have challenged our liberty, there have been men
and women willing to stand up and put their lives on the line for the
sake of all Americans. They believed so fully in our right to live
free, that many gave their lives to preserve
it.
Today, we honor those sacrifices and all the sacrifices of our men and
women in uniform, current and former. The debt we owe these brave men
and women is unimaginable. The down payment on that debt is to ensure
that our words are followed by action, that we strive every day to
live up to the ideals for which they made the ultimate sacrifice, and
that our commitments to our veterans are upheld. Our veterans deserve
the very best care America has to offer, and sadly, many have been let
down.
I will continue to do everything in my
power to hold those responsible for breaking this promise accountable
and ensure that our veterans are getting the care they need. Some of my
efforts to raise awareness of this important issue are outlined on
the right.
Happy Memorial Day, and God
bless.
