Friend -
I wanted to share this
story
of a miracle baby with you.
When Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler was pregnant, her doctors told her that her baby didnt have kidneys, and she would likely miscarry or the baby would die during birth. When presented with the option of terminating the pregnancy, she and her husband determined that with faith and some courage, they were going to fight for their daughters life.
After undergoing extensive and rare procedures, Abigail was born and is now 14 months old.
Life is precious and deserves our respect and protection. I am proud to join my colleagues like Congresswoman Herrera Beutler in being a strong advocate for the unborn.
Yours in service,
Randy
