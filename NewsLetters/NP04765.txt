We all know Boehner can&rsquo;t stop bragging about how he has us beat.
Now, none other than Mitt Romney has jumped on the premature celebration bandwagon.
While these guys kept talking, President Obama asked for your help before tomorrow&rsquo;s election. And something incredible happened!
We are nearing an UNBELIEVABLE 5O,OOO online donations. That is HUGE! David, this is exactly the kind of response President Obama was looking for!
Election Day is TOMORROW. If we can hit our goal, we can get-out-the-vote, win big Democratic victories, and leave Romney and Boehner SHOCKED on Election Night!
