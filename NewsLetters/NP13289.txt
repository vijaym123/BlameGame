Dear Friends,
Happy New Year! I hope you had a wonderful holiday season, and I wish
you a happy and healthy 2014. Our calendars are wide open for
opportunities to improve our lives and the lives of those around us.
Unfortunately, 2013 was billed as the year of the "do nothing"
Congress. But the script for 2014 has not yet been written, and I hope
Congress will be able to move forward and forge a new record of
accomplishment.
In 2014, I want to be part of the "making change" Congress, starting
with the extension of unemployment insurance for 1.3 million Americans.
In Rhode Island in particular, a state with an unemployment rate at 9
percent, this benefit cut is unacceptable and would be a step backward
during what has already been a challenging economic recovery. I
appreciate the leadership of my Senate colleague Jack Reed on this
issue, and I support his efforts to extend benefits immediately while a
long-term plan can be devised.
Our 2014 to-do list doesn't end there. We have a lot of ground to make
up, and that should include passage of legislation to promote job
growth, immigration reform and responsible tax reform. It is especially
important that we agree upon a clear path forward for our budgetary
priorities. Last year was plagued by indecision and bickering; I am
hopeful this year will be different and we can avoid another battle
over the debt ceiling. Shutting down the government again and injecting
more uncertainty into our economy is not an option.
I am anxious to return to Washington this week to start crossing items
off the list. What issues are most important to you? Share your
thoughts via email

and Twitter

Sincerely,

Get Covered
One of my top priorities in Congress has been the establishment of a
universal health care system that increases quality, affordability and
efficiency. The rollout of the Affordable Care Act was challenging, but
I am confident that we can learn from these growing pains and continue
to improve the system. I was proud to sign up for my insurance through
the exchange. If you are having trouble with your coverage through
HealthSource RI
, please contact my office. We are here to help!

Buying Local
The holidays are over, but that shouldn't stop you from supporting
small business in Rhode Island. In December, I embarked on a "shop
small" tour, meeting with business owners at locally-owned shops at The
Mill at Shady Lea in North Kingstown, the arcade in Providence and
Garden City Center in Cranston. Read about my visits on my blog
and learn
more about the economic importance of small business.

Dear

Happy
New

I

2014.
Our
