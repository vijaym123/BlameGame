Under the current administration, despite being almost five years into a recovery, our economy continues to struggle and millions of Americans remain unemployed or underemployed.
I know that Americans really want paychecks, not unemployment checks.
Unfortunately, last month, an estimated 800,000 Americans simply stopped looking for work, causing the labor force participation rate to drop to 62.8%
the lowest percentage since the 1970s. In short, it was fewer people looking for work, not more jobs, that caused the decline in unemployment. Furthermore, the U.S. economy has become less entrepreneurial under the current administration. According to
a recent study conducted by the Brookings Institution , businesses are collapsing faster than they are being formed.
Jobs are issue number one for the American people.
I believe the best way to fight for policies that will help job growth is to use real life stories from small business owners and families in the 5th District of Texas.
If your business has been hurt by government policies that were created to help a politically-favored industry, or if you have pulled yourself up by your bootstraps, worked hard, and achieved success without the governments help through bailouts our handouts, I want to hear from you.
