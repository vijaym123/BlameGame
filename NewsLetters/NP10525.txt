LEGISLATIVE
April 16, 2014
D e ar Friends,
Its always a pleasure to
meet residents from my district, especially
students.
I recently had a chance to speak with 300 students
from Eastchester Middle School, during their visit to the U.S. Capitol. I
spoke with them for about 20 minutes on the history of the Capitol
Building, and the legislative process.
Eager
students asked questions on a variety of topics, from education
reform to the growing crisis in
Ukraine.
Young people really can make a difference. I hope their visit to the
Capitol will encourage them to become more engaged in their community, as
well as spark an interest in
government.
These students are our future. Let's continue to support
them.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
