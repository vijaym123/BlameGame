May is Jewish American Heritage
Month
In 2006, the late Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) and I sponsored a
resolution to designate each May as Jewish American Heritage Month
(JAHM).
This May marks the ninth anniversary of JAHM, proclaimed
first by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama
thereafter.
Jewish American Heritage Month is a special occasion to
celebrate the myriad accomplishments and contributions of Jewish
Americans to the United States enduring role as an economic, political,
military, and cultural global leader. One of the ways we celebrate those
achievements is by educating the broader American public about Jewish
Americans who have woven part of the tapestry that is the unique
American experience.
There are so many ways to honor this years
Jewish American Heritage Month and the continued pursuit of tikkun
olam, or repairing the world, by looking to our past and present
community leaders.
Please take some time this month to attend a
community event, lecture or celebration to learn a bit more about what
Jewish Americans have contributed to our nation.
For
instance, I am participating in a wonderful program this Saturday evening, May
10 th .
The New World Symphony will perform a special
concert featuring Jewish American composers in recognition of
JAHM.

I am proud to represent one of the largest Jewish
populations in the United States, and to serve as the chief sponsor
of JAHM in the U.S. Congress.
